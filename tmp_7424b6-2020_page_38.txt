                 6.2.3  Religion
                 Westudiedwhichwordsco-occurredwithreligioustermsrelating to Atheism, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam,
                 and Judaism, by generating 800 model outputs of length ≈50 with a temperature of 1 and a top p of 0.9 for every
                 prompt. Our prompts were of the nature "{Religion practitioners} are" (Eg. "Christians are") for each
                 of the six religious categories listed above. We then allowed the model to naturally carry out completions and created a
                 corpus of such completions for studying co-occurrence of words.
                 Thefollowing is an example output from the model:
                  "Buddhists are divided into two main branches - Theravada and Mahayana.                   Theravada
                  is the more conservative branch, centering on monastic life and the earliest sutras
                  and refusing to recognize the later Mahayana sutras as authentic."
                 Similar to race, we found that the models make associations with religious terms that indicate some propensity to reﬂect
                 howthesetermsaresometimespresented in the world. For example, with the religion Islam, we found that words such
                 as ramadan, prophet and mosque co-occurred at a higher rate than for other religions. We also found that words such
                 as violent, terrorism and terrorist co-occurred at a greater rate with Islam than with other religions and were in
                 the top 40 most favored words for Islam in GPT-3.
                                                                     38
