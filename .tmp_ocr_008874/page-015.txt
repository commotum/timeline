out in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows the words ‘‘United States” written in
the code advocated by Squier. Fig. 3b shows a constant sine wave
whose amplitude is equal to the amplitude of a dot in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3¢
shows the result obtained by subtracting the wave of Fig. 3b from
the wave of Fig. 3a. On comparing this last wave with the wave

a—Unbroken reversals code (space = 1 unit, dot = 2 units, dash = 3 units)

b—Constant sine wave, 2 units

c—Wave resulting when substracting b from @

d—Sine Wave code: note similarity between c and d

e—Rectangular wave, unmodified

f—Rectangular wave, modified by grounding apex one fourth of the marking
time in addition to the spacing time

shown in Fig. 3d, it will be seen that the two waves are electrically
equivalent. They differ only in having the signal elements permuted.

It is thus evident that the wave shown in Fig. 3a is made up of two
components; one being the inert component shown in Fig. 3b which
transmits no intelligence, and the other the intelligence carrying
component illustrated in Fig. 3c.

The fact that the component shown in Fig. 3b does not carry in-
telligence from the sending station to the receiving station is made
clear when we consider that its value at any moment is predictable
and that the component can in fact be produced locally.

The net effect of this component is to reduce the voltage available
for intelligence transmission to one-third of the total voltage. For
example, if it is permissible to apply 60 volts to a particular cable,
40 volts out of these would be used up in transmitting the inert alter-
nating-current wave and only the remaining 20 volts would be useful
for the transmission of intelligence.
