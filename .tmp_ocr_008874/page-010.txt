CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING TELEGRAPH SPEED 333

elements, may be determined approximately by the following formula,
the derivation of which is given in Appendix B.

W=K logm

Where W is the speed of transmission of intelligence,
m is the number of current values,
and, XK isa constant.

By the speed of transmission of intelligence is meant the number of
characters, representing different letters, figures, etc., which can be
transmitted in a given length of time assuming that the circuit trans-
mits a given number of signal elements per unit time.

Substituting numerical values in this formula gives the following
table which indicates the possibilities of speeding up the transmission
of intelligence by increasing the number of current values.

This table indicates that there is considerable advantage to be
secured in going to more than two current values where the circuits
are such as to permit it and where the line speed is not lowered as a
result. The limitations will be outlined below. It should also be
noted that whereas there is considerable advantage in a moderate
increase in the number of current values, there is little advantage in
going to a large number.

In the case of printer codes, the theoretical results derived corre-
spond closely to practise, as will be obvious from the method of
deriving the formula.

In order to compare the theoretical possibilities indicated by the
formula with the results which are obtained when non-printer codes
are constructed, several codes were assumed, and for each one the
number of signal elements required to produce an average letter
