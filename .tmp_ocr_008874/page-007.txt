transmitting medium, because they contain frequency components
which may easily extend into the range allotted to neighboring carrier
bands. For this reason it is customary in carrier telegraph practise
to make use of a transmitting filter to cut off these interfering fre-
quencies. The voltage impressed on this filter is substantially
rectangular in outline but after passing the filter it has a shape which
is approximately similar to curve C in Fig. 1, and which, therefore,
produces less interference than a half-cycle sine wave.

Lanp LINES

The case of land lines is somewhat different from the case discussed
previously because it is not economically desirable to utilize the full
frequency range available. In other words, the great expenditure
for terminal apparatus that may be proper in the case of submarine
cables and long distance radio circuits is not warranted. In land
circuits the highest frequencies transmitted are considerably greater
than the required line speed. When this is the case, it is usually
possible and desirable to make use of the available range to increase
the steepness of the received wave. A steep wave front results in
prompt operation of the receiving relay and this in turn results in
minimum distortion. If a half-cycle sine wave were to be employed
instead of the usual rectangular wave or if a network were to be
employed which were to round off the wave to the extent indicated
in Fig. 1, the received wave would necessarily lose a great part of its
steepness and as a consequence the response of the receiving relay
would be less positive and the signals would be distorted. It will, of
course, be understood that by means of suitably proportioned net-
works the wave can be rounded just enough to meet the interference
requirement, still retaining sufficient steepness to insure prompt
operation of the receiving relay. Therefore, rounding by means of
networks is preferable.

If it should be desirable and practicable to utilize the frequency
range to its fullest, what has been said above about a distortionless
line holds without any substantial modification and it would, in
that case also, be more advantageous to use a wave rounded by means
of suitable networks than to impress on the line a wave of the half-
cycle sine form.

SUBMARINE CABLES
In the case of submarine-cable telegraphy, there is a limitation on

voltage which has not been emphasized in the simple direct-current
case discussed above. The voltage which may be impressed on the
