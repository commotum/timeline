APPENDIX C

The deduction of the curves given in Fig. 2 from the curves given
in Fig. 1 requires some explanation. Looked at casually, it would
seem as if an isolated dot would not possess any frequency character-
istics whatsoever. Nevertheless, if a voltage, such as any of those
represented in Fig. 1, is applied to a network capable of being thrown
into oscillation, the network will respond to the voltage by oscillating.
Suppose, for simplicity, that the network consists of an inductance,
a capacity and a very small resistance in series, the response of the
network to the application of any of the voltages illustrated is that
it oscillates at constant frequency and gradually decreasing ampli-
tude. Further, the response varies when the natural period of the
circuit is varied.

There are two ways of looking at this phenomenon. We may say,
on the one hand, that the oscillations of the frequency in question
are manufactured by the network out of the voltage applied and that
the frequency does not exist in the original voltage. On the other
hand, we may say that the original voltage contains components
at or near the resonant frequency and that the circuit responds to
these components, because it offers them a small impedance, while
it does not respond to other components because it offers them a large
impedance. Either of these views is permissible, but it is convenient
for the purposes of this paper to use the nomenclature of the second
view and to consider the applied voltages to be made up of an in-
definitely large number of frequencies. The problem of determining
the response of oscillating networks is then solved by deducing the
frequency characteristic or the response characteristic of the im-
pressed voltage. This characteristic may be determined by means
of the Fourier integral, whose computation is described in any stand-
ard textbook on the subject. The following is intended to outline
the considerations, from a physical standpoint, which lead to estab-
lishing this integral.

To deduce the frequency characteristic of an isolated dot, it is
simplest to start with a long series of dots which are uniformly spaced.
If such a-series of dots is considered to extend indefinitely, it is possible
to analyze the resultant wave into a Fourier series by well known
methods. Now, suppose that such a Fourier series has been ob-
tained for a given spacing of the dots. The next step is to increase
