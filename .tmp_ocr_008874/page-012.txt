CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING TELEGRAPH SPEED 335

place, there is a theoretical increase in the ratio of 1.6:1 which ac-
companies the change from the two-current-value to the three-current-
value code. In the second place, there is an incidental increase in the
ratio of 1.4:1, due to the fact that the present two-current-value codes
are longer than would be necessary, if receiving were done by means
other than the ear. The total increase in going from the two-current-
value Continental or American Morse codes to the three-current-
value Continental code is, therefore, in the ratio of 1.6X1.4:1 or
2.2:1, provided the line speed is the same. In this connection it
should be noted that in the case of the American Morse, the ratio
is probably somewhat less than this for the reasons pointed out above.

LrMITATIONS IN APPLYING CoDES WITH MorRE THAN
Two CurRENT VALUES

Certain inherent limitations which have to do with how much the
number of current values can be advantageously increased are as
follows:

1. Fluctuations in transmission efficiency of the circuit,

2. Interference,

3. Limitations on the power or voltage which it is permissible to
employ.

In addition it may be stated that, in general, whenever more than
two current values are employed it is necessary to make the sending
and receiving means more complicated and expensive. There may
be nothing to gain, therefore, in using codes other than those made
up of two current values where the telegraph circuits are cheap.

Considering now the features which limit the number of current
values which can be employed, it is believed that the importance of
the first factor will be obvious. If the line is subject to fluctuations
so that the stronger currents at certain times become less in magni-
tude than the weaker currents at other times, it will be impossible
to discriminate between the different current strengths making up
the code, particularly if the fluctuations are rapid.

In connection with interfering currents, it is evident that these
may be of such polarity as to add to or subtract from the signaling
currents and it is consequently necessary to separate the various
current values employed sufficiently so that one current value with
the interference added may be distinguished from the next larger
current value with the interference subtracted.

The spacing between the current values being determined by the
interference and fluctuations in transmission efficiency, it will be
