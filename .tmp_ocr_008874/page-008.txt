CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING TELEGRAPH SPEED 331

cable is limited to a definite value. Moreover, for certain reasons, the
cable has an impedance associated with it at the sending end which
may make the voltage on the cable differ from the voltage applied
to the sending-end apparatus. Inasmuch as the limitation in this
case is voltage limitation at the cable, the ideal wave is one which
applies a rectangular wave to the cable rather than to the apparatus,
because it insures that the area under the curve should be the maxi-
mum consistent with the imposed limitations. It would be possible
to make the transmitting-end impedance approximately propor-
tional to the cable impedance throughout most of the important
range. This would insure that the wave applied to the cable would
have approximately the same shape as the wave applied to the ap-
paratus. It would probably be desirable for practical reasons to
make this impedance infinite for direct current.

In connection with the submarine cable a special kind of inter-
ference is particularly important, namely, that due to imperfect
duplex balance. For a given degree of unbalance, the interference
due to this source may be reduced by putting networks either in the
path of the outgoing current or in the path of the incoming current.
These facts, together with the frequency distributions deduced above
for each of the several impressed waves as exhibited in Fig. 2, make
it apparent that the beneficial reaction on the effect of duplex un-
balance, which can be obtained by the use of a half-cycle sine wave
instead of a rectangular wave, can be obtained more effectively
by the use of a simple network, either in the path of the outgoing
or in the path of the incoming currents. Either of these locations is
equally effective in reducing interferences from duplex unbalance,
but the location of the network in the path of the outgoing current
has the advantage that it decreases the interference into other circuits,
whereas the location in the path of the incoming current has the effect
of reducing the interference from other circuits.

Before leaving the matter of submarine telegraphy, it may be well
to point out that it is common in practise to shorten the period during
which the battery is applied so as to make it less than the total period
allotted to the signal element in question. For instance, if it is
desired to transmit an e the battery may be applied for, say, 75 per
cent. of the time allotted to that e and during the remaining 25 per
cent. the circuit is grounded. The resulting voltage is shown in
Fig. 3F. From the foregoing, it is concluded that this method is less
advantageous than the application of the voltage for the whole period,
because while the shape of the received signal is substantially the same
in the two cases, the magnitude, being proportional to the area under
