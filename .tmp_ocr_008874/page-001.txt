Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'

By H. NYQUIST

Synopsts: This paper considers two fundamental factors entering
into the maximum speed of “transmission of intelligence by telegraph.
These factors are signal shaping and choice of codes. The first is con-
cerned with the best wave shape to be impressed on the transmitting
medium so as to permit of greater speed without undue interferencé either
in the circuit under consideration or in those adjacent, while the latter
deals with the choice of codes which will permit of transmitting a maxi-
mum amount of intelligence with a given number of signal elements.

It is shown that the wave shape depends somewhat on the type of
circuit over which intelligence is to be transmitted and that for most
cases the optimum wave is neither rectangular nor a half cycle sine wave
as is frequently used but a wave of special form produced by sending
a simple rectangular wave through a suitable network. The impedances
usually associated with telegraph circuits are such as to produce a fair
degree of signal shaping when a rectangular voltage wave is impressed.

Consideration of the choice of codes show that while it is desirable to
use those involving more than two current values, there are limitations
which prevent a large number of current values being used. A table of
comparisons shows the relative speed efficiencies of various codes pro-
posed. It is shown that no advantages result from the use of a sine wave
for telegraph transmission as proposed by Squier and others? and that
their arguments are based on erroneous assumptions.

SIGNAL SHAPING

EVERAL different wave shapes will be assumed and comparison
will be made between them as to:

1. Excellence of signals delivered at the distant end of the circuit,
and

2. Interfering properties of the signals.

Consideration will first be given to the case where direct-current
impulses are transmitted over a distortionless line, using a limited
range of frequencies. Transmission over radio and carrier circuits
will next be considered. It will be shown that these cases are closely
related to the preceding one because of the fact that the transmitting
medium in the case of either radio or carrier circuits closely approxi-
mates a distortionless line. Telegraphy over ordinary land lines
