CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING TELEGRAPH SPEED 339

Radio and Carrier Telegraphy. Squier has also advocated ® that
the combination of sine wave envelopes, unbroken reversals and a
three-current-value code be applied to radio and carrier telegraphy.

The advantages and limitations in applying codes with more than
two current values have been fully discussed above, and do not need
to be gone into further here. It will be evident that the combining
with these of sine wave envelopes and unbroken reversals does no good.

The matter of using sine wave envelopes was discussed above, the
discussion pointing out that waves with sine-wave envelopes are
inferior to waves produced by sending rectangular shaped signals
through suitable networks, both from the standpoint of the received
signals, and from the standpoint of interference into other circuits.

The ‘unbroken reversals”’ bring in again the use of an inert com-
ponent. Due to the fundamental difference between cable telegraphy
on the one hand, and radio and carrier as usually practised on the
other, the inert component in the latter case is somewhat smaller
than in the former. In the code advocated by Squier, the current
which may be subtracted without greatly affecting the intelligence-
carrying capacity of the signals, is about one unit in value, which is
the current corresponding to a space. When this current has been
subtracted, the space current is reduced from one unit to zero, the
dot current from two units to one, and the dash current from three
units to two. This subtraction having been carried out, it is seen
that the maximum intelligence-carrying component is approximately
two-thirds of the maximum current actually employed. (This
figure of two-thirds compares with the figure of one-third for the
submarine cable.)

In the case of radio, the amount of power which must be radiated
from the transmitting station is of particular importance. Since
with the system advocated by Squier about two-thirds of the maximum
voltage which is radiated is effective in transmitting intelligence, it
is evident that about twice as much power must be radiated as would
be required if the inert component were not transmitted.

Incorrect Assumptions. Two incorrect assumptions are made in
the papers referred to and underlie a considerable portion of the
arguments advanced in favor of the systems advocated by Squier.

One of these is that a wave, whose elements are half-cycle sine
waves, lends itself to tuning. It is true that in the case of the ‘‘un-
broken-reversals’’ code a certain amount of tuning can be secured,
but this tuning applies only to the inert unvarying component in the
wave, which carries no intelligence. The fact, shown in Fig. 2, that
