as the Continental and American Morse codes with an effort to make
them as brief as possible without making the reading too difficult. It
is thought that the two ideal codes chosen are comparable in the
matter of ease of reading. In constructing the two-element code, two
steps are involved. In the first place it is assumed that the markings
and spacings of any integral number of signal elements’ duration can be
used so that in addition to the values for markings and spacings as-
sumed above, there may be dashes of two, four, etc., units duration.
With these assumptions the 26 shortest characters that can be con-
structed are next made up. It is found that one character is of 1 unit
duration, 1 of 2 units, 2 of 3 units, 3 of 4 units, 5 of 5 units and 9 of 6
units duration. The remaining 5 characters are taken of 7 units
duration each. The second step is to ascribe the 26 letters of the
alphabet to these characters in such an order that the most frequent
letters correspond to the shortest characters. It is most efficient
to use the same spacing as was assumed above for the Continental
two-current-value code, with the addition that spaces of longer
duration than three units may be employed within a letter.

The matter of constructing the ideal three-current-value code is
similar. First, the 26 shortest characters are constructed. Two
characters can be constructed having a duration of 1 unit, four char-
acters having a duration of 2 units and eight characters having a
duration of 3 units. The remaining twelve characters are taken 4
units in duration. Next, the most frequent letters are assigned to
these characters in the order of their duration. It is best in this
case to use the same assumptions as to spacings between letters and
words as was used above in connection with the three-current-value
Continental code. The use of spaces within letters is not economical
in this case.

A frequency table given by Hitt § was used to determine the relative
frequency of the various letters. The average duration per letter
was computed from this table and corrected for spaces between words
and letters. The resultant average duration is as follows:

Signal Ele-

ments per
Code Letter
American Morse (two current valugs)..........0..0..05 050s eeeee 8.26
Continental Morse (two current values). 8.45
Ideal (two current values)... .......... 6.14
Continental Morse (three current values) . 3.77
Ideal (three current values). ...........--..00- 3.63
