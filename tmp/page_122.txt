lists all the key terms and phrases teamed with short statements
giving their essential character.

During the course of the chapter several systems were intro-
duced. Figure 2-22 shows how they relate to one another, Focusing
on the internal structure of the systems, it shows four nested
classes of systems (the rectangles), each successively more special-
ized. The most general is just the class of all systems. Systems can
be specialized to machines, which are systems that have a medium,
so that inputs and outputs can be defined for them such that every
machine effects a function from its inputs to its outputs (actually
from the history of its inputs to its outputs). Computational systems
are machines that are capable of producing multiple functions; they
work by using some of their inputs to specify the functions that hold
between other inputs and outputs. Symbol systems are computa-
tional systems with symbols, that is, with devices for distal access.
The diagram doesn’t reflect adequately that the diversity of compu-
tational systems is much greater than that of symbol systems, the
diversity of machines much greater than that of computers, and so
