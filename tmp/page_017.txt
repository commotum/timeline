all that many great laws. But the law is almost never mentioned,
and many psychologists hardly know of it at all.

A theory has been proposed to explain Fitts’ law (Crossman &
Goodeve, 1963; Keele, 1968). In a nutshell, the motor system has
only limited accuracy when operating open loop, so that a sequence

- of visually based corrections are required to bring the movement
within the target area. The system thus operates by simple feedback
control. Consider being a distance X from a target of size S. X will
initially be the distance D in the figure, but we need to consider the
movement at any point along the way. Let the basic accuracy of the
motor system be e. Thus, the initial aim is only accurate enough to
hit within a target of size eX. At some point during the flight, say X,,
the system can be re-aimed at the target to correct for any errors. At
that point, the system can get within eX,. This may still not be
sufficient, so that at some X, a second correction can be made. This
can continue until the pointer can be brought within the target
region. We thus get a sequence of corrections:

X =D
Xnvy = Xn

Stop when X, = $/2
