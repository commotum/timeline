24 « Unified Theories of Cognition

young child. It has been around for a while. To pick a not-so-
random comparison, John Watson wrote his Manifesto for Behav-
forism in 1913 and Clark Hull wrote his Principles of Behavior in
1943. That is again thirty years—from the beginnings of behavior-
ism to its high point. So it is high time that we move forward. We
cannot claim we are a kid—a young science—forever. In fact, we
even had a name change almost a decade ago, to cognitive science,
the umbrella term that we now use to indicate the breadth of our
field.

I do not raise this question of the maturity of cognitive science to
cast aspersions—to mutter about all these years with no results. On
the contrary, my view is that there has been immense progress in all
parts of cognitive science—in artificial intelligence, linguistics, edu-
cation, and, especially, psychology. Such an assertion is conten-
tious. For instance, Fodor, in his Modularity of Mind, claims that

’ essentially nothing is known about central cognition (Fodor, 1983,

pp. 126-129). Perhaps it is mere rhetoric, but he certainly seems to
be in earnest. Perhaps Fodor simply lives in a different world than I
do. Perhaps we are both staring at the same glass, but it is half full
for me and half empty for him. I really cannot imagine. In any
event, progress seems very real to me.

For instance, it is clear that cognition has established a new
paradigm, even with all the defocusing of that concept that has
occurred since Kuhn introduced it (Kuhn, 1962). One amusing sign
that this has happened is that calls have begun for a new paradigm
to replace it. A few years ago, for instance, there began the cry for
ecological realism, flowing from the position of Jimmy Gibson
(1979). ‘Information processing has done its thing,"’ went the call
in effect, ‘it’s time for the next paradigm to come along and we're
it’ (for example, Shaw & Bransford, 1977). The critics are prepared
to recognize the old paradigm at the point when they wish to argue
for its replacement. At the current time, a similar set of calls are
coming from the connectionists, who believe they are the next rev-
olution (Rumelhart, McClelland, & the PDP Research Group, 1986;
McClelland, Rumelhart, & the PDP Research Group, 1986). Critics
need to identify the reigning paradigm, and they are pretty clear
that it is symbolic cognitive psychology. They certainly do not rail
against behaviorism anymore, and I know no one who thinks that
ecological realism is in the saddle and needs to be overthrown.
