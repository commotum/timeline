by both perception and cognition is recognition. Thus, there might
be many computational homologies and even commen processing
substrates. However, there are differences. In particular, cognition
works in an interior milieu and perception specifically addresses the
problem of how to transduce stimulus energies from an exterior
world into this interior world. Thus the computational solutions in
the interior may be specialized in ways we do not understand as
yet.

With respect to the third aspect, the significant powers of human
cognition that are naturally provided by a computational technol-
ogy or scheme, Soar focuses on different aspects from those con-
nectionism focuses on. It considers high-level cognition, such as
problem solving and planning, to be important, as well as the
breadth of cognitive activity. It takes unlimited qualitative adapta-
tion (as we phrased it in Chapter 3) to be significant, and thus the
need for the flexibility associated with universal computation. Thes ¢
characteristics are not beyond connectionist systems, but they rep-
resent items on its far-future agenda.

As to the human cognitive powers that have special appeal to
connectionists, enumerated above, the Soar position is mixed.
Soar, just as much as connectionism, takes automatic learning from
experience as a key power of human cognition, as indicated by the
pervasive role played by chunking. Soar also sees the ability to
bring to bear what the human knows as a key power of cognition. It
approaches this by using a recognition memory and making its
iterative accessing the inner loop of cognition. But this is a more
structured and limited computational scheme than the ability of
connectionist networks to resolve huge networks of constraints. In
fact, the real-time constraint on cognition seems to work against too
powerful constraint satisfaction. Bluntly put, there isn’t time in the
short run to do much integration that isn’t fairly well focused. Weak
constraints would seem to imply that the information that is to
determine the solution is well distributed throughout the set of con-
straints. In turn, that would seem to imply many iterations to ex-
tract the equilibrium state that satisfies all constraints, for not until
some information was extracted from some constraints would the
information in other constraints apply. The real-time constraint is
simply that only a modest number of iterations are available. The
iterative matching of recognition memory also must work within the
real-time constraint, but its more structured processing is built to
