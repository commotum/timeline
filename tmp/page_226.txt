302. Retrieve the input

303. A set of size 2 with elements 1,0

305. Generate one integer in the set

305. The order to generate items is arbitrary

313. The value of the item generated is 0

317. Test if it is member-of-output-set

317. Implemented as a test for it being positive —_[test in domain]

328. The test returns false

330. Discard the item

331. Go again [test-case execution]

332. Retrieve the input

333. A set of size 2 with elements 1,0

335. Generate one integer in the set

335. The order ta generate items is arbitrary

335. There are na iterns left to generate

336. Return the result

336. A set, with elements 1

337. And we've got the answer

343. But did | get all the cases? [test-case execution}

349. We've tooked at cases where the generator in step 2 can generate
elements and where it is finished.

351. We've looked at cases where the test for member-of-output-set in
step 3 returns true and where it returns false.

354, Looks as if all the cases have been considered

357. So we're done with this problem

needs to store that element in the output set (de 280). This store
operation was not in the plan, which was just to generate and test,
because the evaluation did not require looking further in advance to
decide the actual next step.

The store operator completes the computation. But the know!
edge about using test cases includes the fact that no single test case
can establish a complete algorithm. Therefore Soar begins all over
again (dc 301). It retrieves an input, gets the same test case, and
generates an element. An additional part of the knowledge about
using test cases is to make a different choice if one is possible, so it
generates the item 0 (as opposed to 1, which it looked at first). Soar
applies the test of membership and gets false (0 is not a positive
integer). [t can see from the specs that this item is not part of the
result, hence is to be discarded. This ends the third pass through the
