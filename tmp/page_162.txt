Human Cognitive Architecture = 149

acquisition rates, not of the time between presentation and storage.
The latter cannot be measured in the current art, since immediate
Tesponses are always mediated by temporary short-term memory.
This fast-read, slow-write character of long-term memory is exactly
what we would expect if the responses continually move from the
~~10 sec level to the ~~1 sec level. The occasions for learning
new information show up in the ~~I0 sec range. This is where
knowledge is available from the environment about what to learn,
namely experience attained in working at ~~10 sec. Thus, what
would govern the slow-write phenomenon is the opportunity for
acquisition. This locates its cause not in the time constants of a
slow consolidation mechanism or the like, but in the occasions for
learning. Of course, this is only another plausibility, for nothing in
the picture of Figure 3-9 could exclude alternative mechanisms.

We have completed the climb up the four cognitive levels. All
these levels are neurophysiological levels as well—it is the same
system, simply under different descriptions—but the higher levels
of organization have their own characteristics. They no longer ap-
pear simply as ever more complex neural circuits. In particular,
with cognition we have left the realm of a world that works accord-
ing to physical law. Instead, it is a world that works according to
representational law. The processes have been so composed that
they represent things—objects, relations, and activities—in the ex-
ternal world. The representational world remains mechanistic and,
in Aristotelian language, it is still to be understood as a world of
efficient causality. But the mechanisms are computational mecha-
nisms and the laws are representational laws, which may be of
arbitrary character. There is no mystery how these computational
mechanisms and representational laws arise out of physical mecha-
nisms and laws. In any reasonable sense, the cognitive realm is
reducible to the natural science realm. But there is also no mystery
about why reduction does not bring with it any change in theorizing
about the cognitive realm or in our understanding of it. To predict
and explain behavior requires attention to the computational mech-
anisms and the representational laws. Putatively, aif that the lower-
level systems of the biological band do is support the computational
mechanisms, which in turn operate to enforce the representational
laws. Of course, the systems levels are not perfectly strong, and
there is substantial leakage between them. But that does not change
the basic picture.
