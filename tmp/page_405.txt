. Annotated Models

Models, defined by the structure-correspondence mapping from the
model to the external situation, are theoretically neat, with a solid
underpinning in a branch of logic called model theory.'° But for the
purposes of an agent attempting to adapt to a real world, models are
too restrictive. They give away too much in terms of representa-
tional scope. There is no reason not to consider richer represen-
tations. The ultimate criterion for whether they can be used is
whether their processing can be kept within sufficient limits a
priori, so that the agent can meet the real-time constraints it faces.!!

It is possible to augment models with propositions in ways that
still preserve the essentials of match-like processing. Models with
such augmentations will be called annotated models. Where
needed, we will refer to representations that strictly satisfy the
structure-correspondence principle as pure models. A good ex-
ample of an annotation can be seen in Johnson-Laird’s model repre-
sentation (Figure 7-8). It permits a tag that declares a given element
of the model to be optional. The tag is affixed to the model at the
individual to which it applies. The tag is a way of avoiding having
two pure models, one which has the individual present and one
which does not. These can be built into a single model with an
optionality annotation, because the processing to deal with the op-
tion is localized to one part of the model. If multiple options exist in
a model, each is independent. Thus, each model in Figure 7-8,
having two options, represents four ground situations.

As the example in Figure 7-8 indicates, many representations that
are thought of as models are not pure models (that is, they do not
adhere strictly to the correspondence principle) but affix annota-
tions of one sort or another to increase the representational scope.
Besides optional, an object in a model might be labeled not-exist.
That is, the model represents an external structure from which that

tional system and realizes its semantics in a model. Thus the model is playing the role of
the external world (modet theory tends to include the mapping into the semantic domain
as part of the model). In our considerations, the model is a representation of an external
world “out there" and this latter does not normally have another representation in the
analysis.

IL. Actual or expected processing costs of a representation are distinct from a priori
guaranteed processing limits, The latter may be the more important.
