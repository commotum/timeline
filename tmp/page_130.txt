Human Cognitive Architecture = 117

we? Is the variety of actual functions that we want to compute such
that we could get by with some structure perhaps far removed from
a symbol systema It seems hardly likely, but there is no mathemat-
ical theory to provide definitive answers.

In sum, we will now take it as established that the architecture of
human cognition is a symbol system.

3.2. System Levels

Let us turn to the technology out of which the human architecture is
constructed. The first point is that, of necessity, intelligent systems
are built up of multiple levels of systems (such as the computer-
system levels in Figure 2-3). To analyze the levels in human cogni-
tion, however, we need to consider the topic more carefully. I wish
to maintain that the human architecture is built up of a hierarchy of
multiple system levels and that it cannot be otherwise structured.
Thus, the discovery of the cognitive architecture can proceed with
this assumption.

A system level is a collection of components that are linked to-
gether in some arrangement and that interact, thus producing be-
havior at that system level. In a system with multiple levels, the
components at one Jevel are realized by systems at the next level
below, and so on for each successive level.

That engineered computer systems have a hierarchical structure,
as analyzed in Figure 2-3, can certainly be taken as one pillar of
support. Empirically, everything we understand about engineering
systems to get intelligence tells us that building up multiple levets is
required. This is one of the great empirical invariances. Although
many different ways have been found to construct information-
processing systems, they all still consist of a hierarchy of levels.
Indeed, so far, it is always the same hierarchy.

A second pillar comes from Herb Simon’s analysis of hierarchy
(Simon, 1962). His argument was that stability dictates that systems
have to be hierarchical. Attempts to build complicated systems
without first building stable subassemblies will ultimately fail—the
entire structure will disintegrate before it all gets put together. If
stable subassemblies are created, layer upon layer, then each one
has a reasonable probability of being constructed out of a few parts.
Thus, there exists a general argument that stability dictates the
existence of levels. The stability argument, of course, can be taken
