       C EnsuringQualityandDiversityofExpandedOptions
       Expanding the number of answer options naturally increases the difficulty of the benchmark, but its
       effectiveness relies heavily on the quality, diversity, and contextual relevance of these additional options.
       To ensure this, we implemented a rigorous multi-stage validation process, combining automated and
       humanefforts to produce high-quality results.
        Initial Model-Based Option Augmentation and Filtering. We began by leveraging large language
       models (LLMs) to automate the initial generation and filtering of expanded options. Specifically, GPT-4o
       wasusedtogenerate additional options, while Claude 3.5 acted as a preliminary filter to remove options
       that were contextually irrelevant or logically inconsistent. This step significantly reduced the workload for
       humanreviewers by pre-screening the candidates.
        Two Rounds of Human Review. To further enhance quality and eliminate potential issues, we
       conducted two rounds of meticulous human validation:
       • First Round of Review: Individual reviewers assessed the expanded options for each question. They
        ensured that the options were diverse, logically distinct, and free from ambiguity. If any flaws were
        identified, reviewers were instructed to correct the issues or create new options to maintain the integrity
        of the question.
       • Second Round of Review: A double-check process followed, involving two additional human ex-
        perts who cross-validated each question and its options. This iterative step eliminated any residual
        inconsistencies or errors and provided an additional layer of assurance.
        Bycombiningautomatedmethodswithmulti-stage human validation, we ensured that each expanded
       option met high standards of quality, robustness, and alignment with the intended challenges of the
       benchmark. This approach not only addressed potential weaknesses in automated generation but also
       significantly improved the reliability of the dataset.
