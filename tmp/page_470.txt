been written about panthers as part of recognizing a panther in the
path). Fodor’s discussion on information encapsulation is extensive
and convoluted, because there are many effects that superficially
weigh in on each side of the argument, such as the resistance of
illusions to modification by beliefs in their illusory nature, and the
phoneme-restoration effect that people perceive phonemes that are
not in the input signal under suitable masking. As to the first consid-
eration, Soar’s distinguishing belief from perceived reality would
seem to be primarily a representational issue of being able to dis-
criminate the sources of knowledge. We need a more definitive
commitment on Soar’s part to the way perceived information is
encoded to assess the issue of confusion. As to the second consider-
ation, Soar is certainly a system that is prepared to permit cognitive
considerations to penetrate into perceptual processing. Whether
Soar would ever be overwhelmed by a loss of control in a great rush
of cogitations seems dubious, Comprehension is structured as a
real-time process, by means of the comprehension operators. Arbi-
trary cognitions can be brought to bear through impasses, but these
are relatively infrequent and carry no characteristic loss of control.
Indeed, impasses occur from a lack of knowledge in the ongoing
process (here, input comprehension) and their search for distal
knowledge is driven by relevant knowledge that is obtained in the
process.

On shallow outputs, which is the question of what knowledge the
language input module delivers to general cognition, Fodor mostly
discusses what is implied by the other properties of modularity (fast
processing, encapsulation, and so on) for the content of the output
of the language module. There do not seem to be additional inde-
pendent considerations or evidence that can be brought to bear to
help establish the nature of a modular system. The intent of the
discussion is to make plausible that something like the linguistic and
logical form of perceived utterances constitutes the content of the
output. Likewise, we don’t get useful new considerations from the
examples we have of Soar comprehension. In our small examples,
the output representation is clear enough (the models of the situa-
tion), but too simple to see whether so much knowledge can be
delivered as to be dissonant with some criterion of shallowness of.
output. One difficulty is that we haven't gone far enough to dis-
cover what the inner structure of comprehension operators must be
like—which is what governs what knowledge comprehension can
