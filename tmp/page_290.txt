ELEVATOR BUTTONS

Compatible Incompatible

Figure 5-9. Stimulus-response compatibility (SRC).

responding key on the opposite side of the light that displays. More
incompatible are the two mixed conditions: mixed-inner, where an
outside light corresponds to the button immediately below it but an
inside light corresponds to the opposite inside button; and mixed-
outer, where the center lights correspond to the center buttons and
the outside lights correspond to the opposite outside buttons. It can
be seen from the figures that response times vary with the different
conditions. (Duncan reported only the average of the mixed condi-
tions.)

The empirical demonstration of SRC actually goes back to Fitts
and Seeger (1953). Again, we find Paul Fitts at the discovery of an
important phenomenon. Paul Fitts is one of the heroes of experi-
mental psychology, as far as I'm concerned, although he is known
mostly to engineering psychologists. He introduced several impor-
tant quantitative laws and initiated the investigation of stimulus-
response capabilities. SRC is of major importance in human-
computer interaction and human factors. A large part of what
makes displays and buttons easy to operate is whether stimuli and
responses are compatible. Questions of compatibility show up in
mundane ways, too, such as the common error of increasing the hot
water in the shower when cooler water is wanted because no natu-
ral arrangement exists on which to base a compatible response.
