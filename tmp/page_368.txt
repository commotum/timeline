created to resolve. Thus, working-memory elements are locked in
to the functions of resolving impasses and are not available in an
independent way (as if written on an internal scratch pad).

Without going any further than this, Soar can be seen to be a
classical organization of a short-term memory and a long-term
memory. It would be hard to build a system that was more classi-
cally structured—there is the working memory and there is the
production memory, and that's that. It fits the classical organization
so well that if, per Crowder, we have witnessed the demise of STM,
presumably Soar has suffered demise as well, just as it was about to
be born.

The direct way to go further is to assess specific tasks that show
STM effects (for humans), such as the digit-span task (the length of
the sequence of digits, presented one per second, that can be re-
peated back verbatim). The issue is whether the short-term charac-
ter of working memory, as described above, limits the size of the
span. If no effective functional constraint exists, then the require-
ment for some technological limitation has been demonstrated (for
example, the autonomous decay of working-memory elements).
Certainly, the way we have been using states in problem spaces
throughout the book would make this seem to be the case. One
should just be to able attach an indefinite number of digits to an
attribute of the current state (as we did in the item-recognition task
in Chapter 5). And if, by some twist, it were not possible to do it in a
subspace and have these elements stay around, then it could be
done in the top space, which never disappears because it is not
generated by an impasse. That we are not prepared here to add
technological limitations to the architecture pretty much stymies
progress along this route.

Some cautions can be raised about whether this is really the end
of the story. First, by now some barrier should exist to thinking of
arriving digits simply as symbols to be affixed to states. What about
the Epam-like recognition system that data chunking has led us to
establish? Externally presented digits have to be recognized
through this net, and then they may need to be discriminated from
other digits that show up earlier or later. Second, establishing the
single-state principle (moving from Soar4 to SoarS) has changed
when attributes persist or vanish, even in the top state, because a
single data structure, representing the current state, is modified
continuously. Finally, the research on the excessive power of the
