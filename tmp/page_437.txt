as it reads the sentences in the task itself (as shown in Figure 7-15),
only this time it is led to create a new operator do-task, with a new
problem space to implement it, and then to comprehend in the
context of this new implementation space to construct its operators
from the instructions. The instruction sentences are quite simple
and their comprehension does not occasion substantial difficulties.
Each sentence gives the instruction for one operator. The knowl-
edge for doing this is entirely embedded in the semantics of the
words—that is, in the comprehension operators for read, the, sen-
tence, then, examine, . . . , done. The new space it creates from
these instructions is identical to the one coded by hand to give Soar
the original capability to do the sentence-verification task.

Soar must do more than just comprehend the sentence instruc-
tions in Figure 7-17. It must organize itself to do the task. Hence, it
must build the appropriate problem spaces and operators. To do
that, it must build the appropriate ensemble of productions—that
select the problem space at the appropriate impasses, that select the
operators in the service of the goals, and that implement the oper-
ators. This means that Soar must pass from the instruction sen-
tences to the appropriate productions. The only mechanism Soar
has for acquiring new productions is chunking. Thus, Soar creates
the appropriate productions by chunking. But this means, as we
saw in the case of data chunking in Chapter 6, that Soar must
perform tasks that lead to the right chunks.

Figure 7-18 shows, in outline, what is going on. Soar starts with
the instructions being input in linguistic form, which is compre-
hended by the process we have seen. The result is a set of data
structures in working memory that constitute this understanding.
These data structures get stored in long-term memory for later use.
Storage is done by chunking, naturally, since that is what long-term
