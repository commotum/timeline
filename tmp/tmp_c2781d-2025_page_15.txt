                     A.1  PLANNING PROMPTS
                     Toensure behavioural diversity in our SFT dataset, we designed 16 distinct planning prompts, each
                     eliciting a different style of planning. These include prompts that ask the model to identify immediate
                     subgoals, describe short-term action sequences, re-evaluate high-level strategies, or address gaps in
                     information. The idea is to expose the model to a wide range of planning behaviours so that, during
                     RLfine-tuning, it can learn when and how to use the most appropriate planning strategy depending
                     on the situation. When planning is not required, a separate instruction prompt (Prompt 17) is used to
                     guide the model to select the next action based solely on prior plans and observations.
                                              1. Immediate-Subgoal Planner
                       Identify the immediate next subgoal required to progress towards the
                       overall task completion.
                       Outline your plan to achieve this specific subgoal, including any
                       necessary reasoning.
                       Output your plan strictly in the following format:
                       <plan>YOUR PLAN FOR SUBGOAL </plan>
                       Replace YOUR PLAN FOR SUBGOAL with your own plan.
                       Keep your plan relatively brief, only focusing on important
                       information.
                       After your plan, choose exactly ONE action from the allowed actions
                       list that initiates this plan.
                       Output no other text.
                              Prompt 1: Prompt encouraging subgoal identification and targeted execution.
                                              2. Milestone-Focused Planner
                       Consider the overall objective.
                       What is the most crucial intermediate milestone to achieve next?
                       Explain why reaching this milestone is important for the overall task,
                       and outline the steps you’ll take to get there.
                       Output your reasoning and plan strictly in the following format:
                       <plan>YOUR REASONING AND SUBGOAL PLAN</plan>
                       Replace YOUR REASONING AND SUBGOAL PLAN with your own plan.
                       Keep your plan relatively brief, only focusing on important
                       information.
                       After your plan, choose exactly ONE action from the allowed actions
                       list to start working towards this milestone.
                       Output no other text.
                        Prompt 2: Prompt focused on achieving the next key milestone and explaining its relevance.
