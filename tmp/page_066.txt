theories and concepts. But I was simply part of the community in
how I learned to use such notions as knowledge. Here is a sentence
and its explanatory footnote taken from an early paper (Newell,
1962, p. 403):

For anything to happen in a machine some process must know*

enough to make it happen.
“We talk about routines “*knowing’. This is a paraphrase of “in
this routine it can be assumed that such and such is the case." Its
appropriateness stems-from the way a programmer codes—setting
down successive instructions in terms of what he {the programmer)
knows at the time. What the programmer knows at a particular
point in a routine is what the routine knows. The following dia-
logue gives the flavor. (Programmer A looking over the shoulder of
B, who is coding up a routine.) ‘How come you just added Z5 to
the accumulator?” “Because I want...” “No, I mean how do
you know it's a number?"" ‘All the Z’s are numbers, that's the way
Isetit up.”’ (B now puts down another instruction.) “How can you
do that?’ “Because I cleared the cell to zero here at the start of
the routine.”* ‘But the program can branch back to this point in
front of you!"’ “Oh, you're right; I don’t know it’s cleared to zero
at this point.”

The philosophers, of course, have had their own technical devel-
opment of the concept of knowledge, which did not contribute to
the computer science and AI concept, as far as I can tell. Certainly
they are distinct concepts. One difference is clearly evident in what
is here called knowledge is called belief by the philosophers, who
reserve knowledge for something akin to justified true belief. Pecu-
liar problems of scholarship are raised when technical communities
acquire important new concepts by their practice. For instance, the
philosophers have a notion (perhaps even a conceit) called folk
psychology. In distinguishes the psychology of the folk—of the
untutored masses, so to speak—from the psychology as given by
science. Is, then, the use of knowledge by computer scientists part
of folk philosophy? It is certainly not what the computer scientists
write that counts, but how they use it in their practice. One might
equally entertain the notion that the philosopher's use of knowledge
was folk computer science. Except that philosophy got there first,
even if by a different route. Now that philosophy has a pseudopod
into cognitive science, these two views of knowledge are brought
together, mixing in some odd ways.
