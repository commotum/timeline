tion cycle is constant, then the production duration is independent
of target-set size—and none of the Sternberg phenomena occurs.
(A2) On the other hand, if we assume the limited instantiation
mechanism, the production executes in one cycle per item. Then
we get all the basic Sternberg phenomena, as in our qualitative
analysis. However, the slope of the Sternberg plot is ~20 ms, rather
than ~40 ms (the empirical value), if we retain the value of ~20 ms
pet production cycle.

(A3) Finally, if with A2 we also assume limited match power,
then equality tests cannot be done on the fly. Two productions are
required. The item-test-set-up-2 production creates elements (test-
item...) that hold the candidates for testing, This production looks
like the original item-test production except that it has different
variables in each condition (<v> and <p>), The item-test-2 pro-
duction then does the equality testing with a single condition ele-
ment (test-item . . . ) with two <v>s. In this case, depending on
