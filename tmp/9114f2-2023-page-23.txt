Problem 2. Generator pass-rate: 5.8%. In step 7 and 8, the generator starts
performing guess-and-check. This is a common place the model might hallu-
cinate, by claiming a particular guess is successful when it isn’t. In this case,
the reward model verifies each step and determines that the chain-of-thought is
correct.

Problem 3. Generator pass-rate: 1.7%. The generator successfully applies sev-
eral trigonometric identities to simplify the expression.
