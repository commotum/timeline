1.3.1. Harbingers of Unified Theories
So far we have been engaged in stating the need and the benefits of
starting on the enterprise of developing unified theories of cogni-
tion. It is important also to assess cognitive science’s readiness to
produce such unifications. Science, even more profoundly than pol-
itics, is the art of the possible. It does only what can be done next.
In fact, [ see a number of harbingers that suggest that we are ready
to tackle this project.

The first one is Act*. This is the cumulation of a long develop-
ment by John Anderson, starting with HAM, his thesis with Gordon
Bower on a semantic-memory model of memory organization (An-

' derson & Bower, 1973), through ActE, which added a production

system model of procedures (Anderson, 1976), to Act* itself, which
added skill acquisition (Anderson, 1983). More recently Anderson
has moved on to PUPS (Anderson & Thompson, 1989), which is a
learning production system that embodies the analogical schemes
central to the skill acquisition theory of Act*.?

Act* is a theory of the human cognitive architecture. It specifies
the memory and processing structures that underlie human per-
formance in all tasks. Figure 1-8 gives the block diagram of the Act*
architecture. There is a long-term declarative memory in the form
of a semantic net. It has multiple basic data types—for sequences,

' for images, and for propositions—linked together by associations.

There is a long-term procedural memory in the form of productions.
Each production has a set of conditions on the declarative mem-
ory and a set of actions that create new nodes or associations in
the declarative memory. The architecture is activation based. The
nodes of the long-term declarative memory each have a degree of
activation, and the working memory is that part of the long-term
memory that is highly activated. Activation spreads through the
semantic net automatically. Activation also determines how fast the
matching of productions proceeds.

All the above relates to performance. Act* also embodies a the-
ory of learning. First, the new nodes and associations created by
productions have high activation but are temporary. However,
there is a probability that they will become permanent. This is a
form of direct declarative learning. Second, new productions can be

2. Even more recently Anderson appears to have moved away from architectures to
analysis (Anderson, 1989}, but this does aot affect the picture drawn here.
