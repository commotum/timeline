               Table2:InstructionsanddatatypesusedinourPushGPimplementationofeachproblem.Thecolumn“#Instructions”reports
               the number of instructions, terminals, and ephemeral random constants (ERC) used for each problem. The middle columns
               show which data types were used for each problem. For example, the Basement problem used all instructions relevant to
               exec, integers, Booleans, and vectors of integers. The last column lists the constants and ERCs used for the problem. Here,
