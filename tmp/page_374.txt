Intendedly Rational Behavior

————

In this chapter we will explore how humans go about obtaining their
goals—how they intend to be rational. Think of it as exploring the
foothills of rationality. Ideally, given sufficient time, an intelligent
system moves toward the knowledge level, where the signs of the
internal struggle to think fade away and only the adaptive response
to the task environment remains. At this point the system may be
said to have gained the peaks of rationality. But getting there takes
some doing. Indeed, an entire territory must first be traversed.
Especially when the system has only modest time to think and
problem-solve, its behavior must reflect the interaction of its basic
cognitive capacities (the focus of Chapters 5 and 6), the structure of
the task environment, and the body of knowledge it can bring to
bear to filter through its partial and imperfect representation and
accessing structure.

I cannot cover this whole territory in one chapter. Instead, I shall
pick three particular tasks that will allow me to make several
points. We wil! look at cryptarithmetic, then syllogisms, and finally
simple sentence verification. The tasks are all quite simple, though
not so simple as the immediate-response behaviors examined in
Chapter 5 and the basic learning situations in Chapter 6. The points
I wish to make are not how Soar does these tasks—they are simple
enough to provide no challenge, given what we know about infor-
mation processing and Al—but about the nature of intended ration-
ality and how it arises.

In this chapter my secondary theme is the different uses of simu-
lation. A unified theory of cognition, I have argued, is to be cast as
an architecture. That is a major source of the communality that
binds together the behavior on all the tasks that the organism faces.
Thus the question arises of how to extract from the stipulated ar-
