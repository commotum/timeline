                  The next result explains in which sense these descriptions are universal.  Let 
              X  be  an  arbitrary string,  and let  A  be some finite set  that  contains x.  Let  I  be 
              the maximal complexity of the elements of A.  As before, let us split the strings of 
             complexity at most I (there are Ni of them) into parts corresponding to ones in the 
             binary representation of TV/.  Let В be the part that contains x,  and let 2s  be its 
             size.
                  Theorem 262.  The hypothesis В = Bxy  (considered as an explanation for x) 
              is not worse than A in terms of complexity and optimality deficiency:
                  (a)  C{B)KC{A) + 0{\ogl);
                  (b)  5{x IB) ^ S(x I A) + O(logZ);
                  (c)  C(B\A) ^ О (log/)  (the hypothesis В is simple given A).
                  Proof.  Knowing A and /, we can enumerate all strings of complexity at most I 
             until we see all the elements of A.  At that moment the string x already appears, and 
             it belongs to the part of size 2s, so there are only О(2s) strings yet to be discovered 
              (from this part and the smaller parts).  Therefore, we know N[ with precision О(2s), 
             and therefore we know its first I — s bits (with O(l)-advice).  And this information, 
             together with I and s, determines B.  Therefore,  C(B\A)  ^  O(logZ),  so we have 
             proved (c) and therefore (a).
                  The statement (b) follows directly from the construction.  Indeed, if C(A) = a 
             and log фА — ß, then all the strings in A have an (a*/3)-description and complexity 
             at most a + ß + O(loga), so their maximal complexity I does not exceed a + ß + 
             O(loga).  The two-part description we have constructed is an ((/ — s)*s)-description 
             (as the previous theorem shows), so its total length and optimality deficiency do 
             not exceed those of A.                                                                    □
                  The  relation  between  parameters  of descriptions  A  and  В  is  illustrated  by 
             Figure 54:  the dot corresponds to the parameters of A,  and the gray area shows 
             the possible parameters of B.
                  What happens if the initial hypothesis A is already on the boundary of Px? 
             Does it mean that В has the same parameters as A?  Generally, no:  the model В 
             may lie on the dashed part of the boundary of the grey area shown in Figure 54. 
             (It is not possible that В is inside the grey area, since in this case A will correspond 
             to the internal point of Px.)
                  In other words,  assume that the boundary of Px consists of vertical lines and 
             non-vertical  lines  with  slope  —1.   Then the left-upper  endpoints  of non-vertical
