                320               10.  INEQUALITIES  FOR ENTROPY,  COMPLEXITY AND  SIZE
                                                                    •   • 
                                                                •       • 
                                                                •   •
                                                   Figure 32.  A uniform set
                (for each combination of /-coordinates there are at most m(J\I) combinations of 
                /-coordinates,  and for each of them there are at most m(K\I U J)  combinations 
                for //-coordinates).
                     We can use this inequality to prove the inequality considered earlier,
                     m(fa,..., kn) ^ m(fa) ■ m(fa\fa) ■ m(fa | fa, fa) • ... • m(kn \ fa,..., kn-i)
                (which is evident anyhow, but let us continue the argument,  it will soon become 
                clear why we do this) by grouping factors in the right-hand side.  For example, the 
                product
                                                 m(fa I fa, fa) • m(fa I fa, fa, fa)
                is at least
                                                          m( fa,fa\fa,fa),
               then the product
                                                   m{ fa\fa) • m(fa, fa\fa, fa) 
               can be replaced (without increase) by
                                                          m^fa, fa, fa I fa),
               and so on, until we get the left-hand side.  For a uniform set, therefore,  all these 
               inequalities are equalities (since the first and last terms in the chain of inequalities 
               are equal).  Now we conclude that for uniform sets the inequality
                                             m(J U K\I) ^ m(J 11) • m(K | / U J)
               turns into  an equality for all I, J, K.  Indeed,  we can find a chain of inequalities 
               where this inequality appears.  The equation
                                             m(J U К 11) — m(J 11) • m(K \ I U J)
               can,  therefore,  be  considered  as  an  (equivalent)  definition  of uniform  sets.  We 
               require it to be true for every disjoint set I, J, К of indices.
                      285  Following this argument, give a complete proof that the property above
               is an equivalent definition of uniform sets.
                      286 Prove that a projection of a uniform set on every subset of coordinates 
               is again a uniform set.
                      287 Prove that every section of a uniform set  (we fix some coordinate and
               consider the set of possible values of all other coordinates) is again a uniform set.
                     Uniform sets are important as sources of random variables.  Consider a uniform 
               set  A  C  Xi  X  • ■ •  X  Xn  and  a random  point  that  is  uniformly  distributed  in A. 
               Its projection onto the ith coordinate is a random variable with values in Xf, we 
               denote this variable by &.
