                          2.  COMPLEXITY  OF PAIRS  AND  CONDITIONAL COMPLEXITY
             32
             where  (bin(/(:r))  is  the  binary representation of the  length  l{x)  of the string x). 
             Now
                                       l{x) = l{x) + 21og/(:r) + 0(1).
             This trick can be iterated:  for any prefix-free encoding x h+ x,  we can construct 
             another prefix-free encoding
                                               x h-> bin(/(:r)):r.
             Indeed, if bin(/(:r)):r is a prefix of bin(l(y))y, then one of the strings bin(/(:r)) and 
             bin(/(?/)) is a prefix of the other one, and therefore Ып(/(ж)) = bin(/(r/)).  Therefore 
             ж is a prefix of у, and l(x) = l(y), so x = y.  (In other words, we uniquely determine 
             the length of the string, since a prefix-free code is used for it, and we then get the 
             string itself knowing where it ends.)
                 In this way we get a prefix-free encoding such that
                                l(x) = l(x) + logl(x) + 2 log log l(x) + 0(1),
             then (one more iteration)
                        l(x) = l(x) + log l(x) + log log l(x) + 2 log log log l(x) + 0(1),
             etc.
                 Now we return to the proof.  Let D be the optimal decompressor used in the 
             definition of Kolmogorov complexity.  Consider a decompressor D' defined as
                                           D'(pg) = [D(p),D(q)],
            where p is  a prefix-free  encoding  and  [•, •]  is  the  encoding  of pairs  (used  in  the 
            definition of pairs complexity).  Since p is a prefix-free encoding, D' is well defined 
             (we can uniquely extract p out of pq).
                 Let p and q be the shortest descriptions of x and y.  Then pq is a description 
            of [x,y], and its length is exactly as we need in our theorem.  (The more iterations 
            we use for the prefix-free encoding, the better bound we get.)                     □
                 Theorem 16 implies that
                                     C(x, y) < C(x) + C(y) + O(logn)
            for  strings  x  and  у  of length  at  most  n:  one  may say  that  the  complexity of a 
            pair does not exceed the sum of the complexities of its component with logarithmic 
            precision.
                  16  Suggest  a natural  definition  for  the  complexity of a triple.  Show  that 
            C(x, y, z) < C(x) + C(y) + C(z) + O(logn) for every three strings x, у, z of length 
            at most n.
                 A natural question arises:  is it true that C(x,y) ^ C(x) + C{y) + 0(1)?
                 A simple argument shows that this is not the case.  Indeed, this inequality would 
            imply C(x, y) ^ l(x) + l(y) + 0(1).  Consider some N.  For each n = 0,1, 2,..., A, 
            we have 2n strings x of length n and 2N~n strings у of length N — n.  Combining 
            them, we (for a given n) obtain 2N different pairs (x, y).  The total number of pairs 
             (all n = 0,1,..., Af give different pairs) is (N + 1)2N.
                 Assume that indeed C(x,y) < l{x) + l(y) + 0(1) = A + 0(1) for all these pairs. 
            Then we get (N + 1)2N different strings [ж, у] of complexity at most N + 0(1), but 
            this is impossible (Theorem 7, p.  17, gives the upper bound 0{2N)).
