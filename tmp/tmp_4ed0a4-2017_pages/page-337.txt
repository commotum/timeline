                                                               10.5.   ALMOST UNIFORM  SETS                                                     325
                   for some /, J, and K.  The product decreases at each step, and at the end we get 
                   the  left-hand side.  If the  initial  inequality was  an equality  up to  a c-factor,  the 
                   same is true for the inequalities used at each step.  And the ordering of coordinates 
                   can be chosen in such a way that this process goes through a given triple I, J, К.
                          (b) By assumption
                       m(n| 1,... ,n — 1) • m(n — 111,... ,n — 2) ■                             ■ m(2| 1) • m(l) < cm(l,... ,n),
                   and this inequality can be continued
                                           cm(l,..., n) < cm(n| 1,..., n — 1) • m(l,..., n — 1).
                   Cancelling the terms m(n| 1,... ,n — 1)  in both sides,  we see that the projection 
                   onto 1, 2,..., n — 1 is c-uniform (and we can do the same for every group of n — 1 
                   coordinates).  Then we can delete one more coordinate, etc.
                          (c) The maximal sizes of the sections for a subset do not exceed the correspond­
                   ing sizes for the entire set, and the size of the entire set is multiplied by e, so the 
                   constant c can be replaced by cje.
                          (d) The random variable £/ has m(I) different values, so its entropy is bounded 
                   by log m(I).  On the other hand, let J = {1, 2,..., n} \ I.  Then
                                                          m(I) ■ m(J\I) ^ cm(l, 2,... ,n),
                   so every value of £/ has probability at most
                                                          m(J|/)/m(l, 2,..., n) < c/m(/),
                   and the entropy is at least logm(I) — loge.
                         (e)  Let us compare the equality
                       я(б,...,£„)
                                = Я(^п|^,...^п_1) + Я(^п_1|6,...^п-2) + -" + Я(б1б) + Я(6)
                   and the inequality
                                        logm(l,... n)
                                               ^ logm(n11,...,n — 1) + logm(n — 111,... ,n — 2)
                                                   -I------h logm(2| 1) + logm(l).
                   The left-hand sides are the same since £ is uniformly distributed in A.  Each entropy 
                   term in the first inequality is bounded by the corresponding logarithm in the second 
                   inequality (the conditional entropy is the average of entropies for all possible values 
                   of the  condition,  and each entropy  in this  average  is bounded by the log-size of 
                   the  range).  Since  A  is  c-uniform,  both sides  of the  inequality  differ  at  most  by 
                   loge.  Therefore,  each entropy can differ from the corresponding log-size at most 
                   by log c.  By grouping the terms in these two sums (after a suitable permutation of 
                   coordinates), we can prove the inequality
                                                log m{J 11) -  log c < H(Çj I £/) < log m(J \ I) 
                   for an arbitrary disjoint set of indices I and J.                                                                             □
                         An immediate corollary of statements (d) and (e) is that if some linear inequal­
                   ity is true for entropies, it is also true for log-sizes of corresponding projections and 
                   sections of a c-uniform set with error term at most A loge, where A is the sum of 
                   absolute values of all coefficients.  (Increasing c, we allow sets that are less uniform, 
                   so the error term increases.)
