                            P r o o f.  Let  us  first  try  the  following  naive  approach  to  (a).  Assume  that 
                     oo  G  Q  is  random with respect  to p  (that  corresponds to probabilities Pi).  Then 
                     the (monotone) complexity of its n-bit prefix is close to a negated logarithm of the 
                     measure of the corresponding interval, which equals
                                                                                      П— 1
                                                                                      IT-
                                                                                      i=0
                     where           = pi  if ooi  =  1  and r*  =  1 — Pi  if ooi  —  0.  If pi  is  close to p'{,  then r*  is 
                     close to            (defined in  the similar way as r*,  but  for the other measure).  So the 
                     product of all Ti is close to the product of all r(; thus, randomness with respect to 
                     one measure implies randomness with respect to the other.
                            All this is indeed true and can be formalized easily, but for this argument we 
                     need to know that the sum
                     (*)                                            X^(“ 1oST) -  JZ(-logr')
                                                                    i=0                       i=0
                     is  bounded;  this is indeed true if ^2 \Pi — p[\  <  oo  (recall that we assume that pi 
                     and р[ are separated from 0 and 1).  But this is a much stronger assumption than 
                     the one we have—we know only that the sum of squares is bounded.
                            How  can  we  improve  this  argument?  Note  that  it  is  enough  for  us  if the 
                     difference (*) is bounded for every random with respect to p sequence.  Let us see 
                     why this happens.  Indeed, if oo is random with respect to p, then
                                                                                          n— 1
                                                        KM(U0 ■ ■ ' OJn—l ) = ^ (-lo g r;) + 0(1).
                                                                                           2=0
                     Since  the  complexity  and  the  negated  logarithm  of measure  differ  by  0(1),  the 
                    upper bound for the complexity in terms of p!  (recall that we can use arbitrary 
                    measure to get an upper bound for monotone complexity) guarantees that
                                                            71—1                      71—1
                                                            ^ (-lo g ri) ^ ^ (-lo g r') + 0(1). 
                                                            i—0                       2=0
                    Let us denote r[ — ri by S{.  Using this notation and taking the exponents, we get 
                    the following inequality (that is true up to a constant factor):
                                                                         71—    1       71—1
                                                                                        П(^+й)-
                                                                         i—0            2—0
                    We know that J2i $ï < °°, so Si —> 0 as i —> oo.  Therefore, for sufficiently large i 
                    the value of 6i  is smaller than e  (the gap between probabilities and 0,1).  We can 
                    change finitely many p\ and assume that it is true for all i.  Then we may consider 
                    a measure p" that is symmetric to p (i.e., pi  is the middle point between p\  and 
                    p'l).  For this measure we can write a similar inequality, only the sign before Si  is 
                    different:
                                                                         72—     1      71—1
                                                                          П г ^   ш * -  ^
                                                                          2 =  0        2 =  0
