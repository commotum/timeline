                                         10.1.  INTRODUCTION AND  SUMMARY                               317
              says  that  some  complexity  is  bounded  by  a positive  linear  combination of some 
              other complexities).  One can also extend this argument to inequalities that have 
              conditional complexities in the right-hand side.  For example, the inequality
                                           C{xi,x2) < C(xi) + C(x2 \xi)
              corresponds to the (evident) combinatorial statement
                                               m(l, 2) < m( 1) • m(211)
              valid for an arbitrary set A C X\  x X2, where by m(l,2) we mean the number of 
              elements in A, by m(l) we mean the number of elements in the first projection of 
              A, and by m(211) we mean the maximal size of all sections of A obtained when the 
              first coordinate is fixed.
                  Let us explain informally why this inequality is a natural combinatorial coun­
              terpart for the inequality about complexities.  The “combinatorial amount of infor­
              mation”  in x\  is logm(l); for a fixed value of X\  we have at most m{211) possible 
              values of x2, so the amount of information in x2 given x\  is (from the combinato­
              rial viewpoint) bounded by logm(2| 1).  And the amount of information in a pair 
              (x\, x2)  G A is measured as log A = logm(l,2).
                   283 Show that every linear inequality of the form L < R, where L and R are
              positive linear combinations of (conditional or unconditional)  complexities and L 
              has only one term, corresponds to a (true) combinatorial inequality.
                  We can describe completely the inequalities of this type that do not include 
              conditional complexities.  Consider an inequality
              (*)                    C{x i,. • • ,xn) < ^    XjC(xi) + О (log A/"),
                                                         i
              where all the coefficients  in the right-hand side are non-negative and the sum is 
              taken over non-empty I except for I — {1,2,..., n}.  (We can assume without loss 
              of generality that the left-hand side includes all X{.  Then if some Xj is missing there, 
              we can delete Xj  everywhere in the right-hand side.  In other words, replacing Xj 
              by the empty string, we get a stronger inequality.)
                  Theorem 204.  The inequality (*) holds if and only if for every г e {1,2,..., n} 
              the sum of coefficients in the right-hand side for the terms including Xi is at least 1.
                  P r o o f.  If the sum of coefficients is less than 1, the inequality is false even for 
              the case when all strings except хг are empty.
                  Assume now that for all i the sum of coefficients near terms that contain X{ is 
              at least 1.  Represent each term as a sum of conditional probabilities; for example,
                                                 C(x 1,x2,x3,... ,xn)
              now becomes
                         C(x i) + C(x2 \xi) + C(x3 |xi,x2) H------h C(xn\xi,... ,xn_i).
              In all the terms (in the left- and in the right-hand sides) we use the same ordering 
              (increasing indices,  as in this example).  Look at the terms C(x{ | • • • )  with some 
              conditions  in  the  left-hand  side  and  in  the  right-hand  side.  On  the  left  we  use 
              all preceding variables as conditions, and on the right some terms may have fewer 
              conditions.  But  the  complexity  may  only  increase  when  a condition  is  deleted, 
              and it  remains to recall that  the sum of coefficients in the right-hand side is  at 
              least 1.                                                                                   □
