                               10.  INEQUALITIES  FOR ENTROPY,  COMPLEXITY  AND  SIZE
               330
               (the size of the set is the sum of sizes of all its sections).  Similarly,
                                              m(l,3) = |Ai3| -  ^2n3(x).
                                                                    X
              The length m^( 1) is the number of non-zero terms in these sums,  and m(l,2,3) 
              has an upper bound,
                                           m(l, 2,3) = \A\ ^ ^ n 2(x)n3(x).
                                                                 X
              One can assume without loss of generality that this inequality is an equality:  we 
              can add missing elements to A leaving A’s projections unchanged.
                   Now we need to split A into two parts В and C, and we need to care about the 
              length of В (its 1-projection) and the size of C.  For a given length of В we need to 
              cover a maximal number of points, so we consider I maximal sections (that make 
              n2(x)n3(x) maximal) and put all their elements in B.  The rest is C.
                   It  remains to prove that the cardinality of C does not exceed  |Ai2| ■ |Ai3|/7. 
              How can we do this?  We have bounds for the sizes of two 2D-projections of C: 
              They do not exceed |^Ti21 and |Ai3|.  We know also that all sections of C (for every 
              X  £ X\)  have  area at  most  Si,  where  Si  is  the  size  of the  Zth  section  of A  (in 
              decreasing order).  Consider the inequality
                               2C{xi,x2,x3) < C(xi,x2) + C(xi,x3) + C(x2,x3 \xi).
              It is easy to prove.  Rewrite all terms of the form C(xi,...) as C(xi) + C(... laq). 
              The left-hand side contains only one term, so we already know that it implies the 
              combinatorial statement
                                      m(l, 2,3)2 < m(l, 2) • m{ 1,3) • m(2,311).
              Therefore
                                                 |C7|2  <  |Л12| • И 13| • S,.
              It remains to show that
                                                    о  .  IA12I • |4i3|
                                                     '          /2
              Recall that В consists of I rectangles, and each of them has size at least Si.  The sum 
              of widths n2(x) of these rectangles is at most  |^4i21,  and the sum of their heights 
              n3(x)  is  at  most  |Ai3|.  The  average width  is then bounded  by  |Ai2|//,  and the 
              average height is bounded by |Ai3|/7.  To finish the proof, note that if S ^ афг for 
              all i = 1,2,..., /, then
                                            e ^ ai + • • • + uz   bi + • • • + bi 
                                                        I                I
              (the logarithm function is concave).
                   So our guess (the combinatorial statement that is similar to the basic inequality 
              about complexities) turns out to be true.
                          10.8.  Combinatorial interpretation:  The general case
                   After all these examples let us consider the general case.  Assume that an arbi­
              trary inequality for complexities is given.  Split the negative and positive coefficients, 
              and get the inequality with positive coefficients in both sides
