                                      9.13.  CHANGE  IN  THE  MEASURE  AND  RANDOMNESS                                   307
                     It remains to prove the bound for ß(Un) mentioned above.  Again imagine that 
                the bits of the sequence are written on cards that lay on the table face down, and 
                the selection rule determines which bit should be revealed next and whether it is 
                used just for information or is selected.  While applying the selection rule,  let us 
                record which cards were turned over and the corresponding bits; we get an (infinite) 
                record, or log file.  Let 7Г be the initial segment of such a record.  By п(тг) we denote 
                the number of terms that were selected during 7Г, and by к (it) we denote the number 
                of ones among these terms.  By rfiir) we denote ith biggest number in a sequence 
                obtained from рсьРь • • • by deleting the terms that correspond to the bits already 
                revealed (for information or for selection).
                     Let ß(Un 17r) be the conditional probability of Un with the condition “the record 
                starts with 7r”.  Let us prove the generalized version of the inequality in question: 
                If n(7г) < n, then
                (*)                      ß(Un\ir) ^ ап-п(тг),к-к(тг)(Г1(1г),Г2(тг), .. .).
                For empty 7r we get the bound we are interested in.  This inequality can be proven 
                by backward induction.  If п(тг) = n, this inequality becomes an equality (left- and 
                right-hand sides are either both zeros or both ones).  Let п(тг)  < n,  and let m be 
                the index of the bit that is turned over immediately after pi (if F(tt) is not defined, 
                then ß(Un 17г) = 0 and we have nothing to prove).  Then
                                        H(Un\ir) =Pmß(UnU\) + (1 -PmM^nko).
                where  7To  and  7Ti  are  obtained  from  7Г  by  adding  that  the  mth  card  contains  0 
                (respectively 1).  Let us show that if (*) is true for 7To and 7Ti, then it is true for it. 
                Indeed, in this case ß(Un 17r) does not exceed
                (**)      Рт&п—п{-к\ ),k — fc(7ri) (^1 (tTI )?■•■) "Ь (1    Pm)otn—n(no),k — k(no) (^"l (^o)? • • •)•
                If the bit on the mth card is used only for information, then n(7To) = n(7Ti) = п(тг) 
                and к(тто) — к(тт\) — k(ir), and it remains to use the monotonicity of an^ and the 
                inequality Гг(7Го) = r.j(7Ti) ^ rfiir).  On the other hand, if the mth bit was selected, 
                then ti(ttq)  = п(тг\)  = п(тт) + 1,  к(тто)  = к(тт),  and k(TTi)  = к(тт) + 1,  and  (**)  is 
                equal to
                                             ап—п{ж),к — к{ж) (P m ? n(7Tl),7-2(7ri), • • •)■
                Note that r;(7Ti) = rfittq) and therefore does not exceed
                                                 ^n—n(n),k — k(n) (Т1 (^") ) Г 2 (^")> • • ■)•
                This ends the proof of the inequality (*) in the case when all 7Г with п(тт) — n have 
                bounded length.  If not, this argument gives a bound for ß(Un,t 17r) where Untt  is 
                the set  of all  sequences  from which a subsequence of length n with more than к 
                ones is selected after revealing at most t bits.  It remains to let t tend to infinity.
                     9.13.4.          Examples.  Now it is easy to  prove  the existence  of Mises-Kolmo- 
                gorov-Loveland sequences with some pathological properties.
                     Theorem  203.  (a)  There  exists  a  Mises-Kolmogorov-Loveland  random  se­
                quence with frequency 1 /2 that is not ML-random with respect to the uniform mea­
                sure.
                     (b)  There exists a Mises-Kolmogorov-Loveland random sequence with frequen­
                cy 1/2  where each prefix has more zeros than ones.
