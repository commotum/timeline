                                    10.13.  NON-SHANNON  INEQUALITIES                     343
            and 6 are independent and uniformly distributed, so each of four possible combina­
            tions has probability 1/4.
                It remains to define a and ß.  It is done as follows:  If 7 = 5, then the common 
            value of 7 and Ö is at the same time the value of a and ß  (so they are equal).  If 
            7 Ф 6, the joint distribution of a and ß (for two cases 7 = 1, Ö = 0 and 7 = 0,6 = 1) 
            is defined as follows:
                                                   0     1
                                              0   1/8   3/8
                                              1   3/8   1/8
            For a fixed value (say) 7 = 0 the conditional distribution of a and ß is the average 
            of this matrix and the matrix
                                                    0   1
                                                0   1 0
                                                1   0 0
            The average is
                                                  0      1
                                             0   9/16   3/16
                                             1   3/16   1/16
            and we get the joint distribution of two independent variables; each is equal to zero 
            with probability 3/4.  On the other hand, the joint distribution of a and ß is the 
            average of all the four matrices (for four possible conditions) and is equal to
                                                  0      1
                                            F
                                            I1   5/16  3/16
                                                 3/16  5/16
            so a and ß are dependent.                                                      □
                Let us summarize what we know about £ for the case n = 4 at this moment. We 
            started with a polyhedral cone defined by basic inequalities.  It is an upper bound 
            for  £.  We  stated  (without  providing  details  of the  corresponding  computation) 
            that the extreme rays of this cone are of two types:  non-special ones and special 
            ones.  For non-special ones it is easy to show that they belong to E, and we get a 
            lower bound for £\  the cone generated by these non-special rays.  One can check 
            (again a computation is needed) that this cone can be equivalently defined as the 
            set  of points  that  satisfy  the  basic  inequalities  plus  Ingleton’s  inequalities.  The 
            last  theorem provides an example of a point in £ that does not satisfy Ingleton’s 
            inequality, so this lower bound is not exact (for n = 4).
                In the next section we will see that the upper bound is not exact either  (for 
            n — 4).
                                  10.13.  Non-Shannon inequalities
                The  inequalities  that  are  not  linear  combinations  of basic  inequalities  were 
            founded in [222,  223];  see  [113]  for more details.  They are called  non-Shannon 
            inequalities.  Currently many such inequalities are known; however, their nature is 
            not well understood yet.  We consider only one example, the inequality from [113] 
            it is probably the most intuitive among them.
