                         Common information
                  11.1.  Incompressible representations of strings
           Is  “the information in a string”  material?  Though this question sounds quite 
        informal, the following example gives an idea of what we are asking.  Assume that 
        we are given a string x whose Kolmogorov complexity is n and thus x “has n bits of 
        information”.  Can we divide that information into two equal parts, as if those bits 
        were pebbles?  This question may be formulated quite formally:  Are there strings 
        x\  and X2, each of complexity nj2, such that C(x\ \ x) ~ 0 and C(x2 |x) ~ 0 (i.e., 
        X\,X2  do not  have any new information compared with x)  and C(x\x\,x2)  ~ 0 
         (i.e., no information is lost)?  It is natural to understand the approximate equalities 
        as equalities holding with accuracy O(logn).  We will soon see that such x\ and X2 
        indeed exist.
           It is convenient to use the following notion in this context.  We say that strings 
        x  and  y are equivalent  with  accuracy c,  or just  c-equivalent,  if C(x\y)  ^  c  and 
        C(y I x) ^ c.  Of course this relation is not an equivalence relation.  If x is equivalent 
        to y, and y is equivalent to z, both with accuracy c, then we can prove only that x 
        is equivalent to 2 with accuracy 2c + O (loge).  (An alternative approach would be 
        to consider sequences xo, x\,..., Xi,... of strings where the length of Xi is bounded 
        by  a polynomial  in i,  instead  of individual  strings;  then  we  may  call  sequences 
        x0,xb ... and j/о, г/i,..., equivalent if C(xi\yi) = O(logi) and С(у{\х{) = O(logi). 
        In this way we get a true equivalence relation on sequences of strings.)
           The complexities of c-equivalent strings are almost the same—they differ by at 
        most 0(c) and even c + O (loge).  More generally, if we replace a string by another 
        string that is c-equivalent to the original one,  then all the complexities involving 
        that string change by at most 0(c).  For example I(x:y\z) changes by at most 0(c) 
        after replacing each of the strings x, y, z  (and even all of them at the same time) 
        by a c-equivalent string.
           Using this notion, we can now formulate our first observation:
           Theorem  221.  For every string x  there is  a string x'  of length C(x) that is 
        О (log C(x))-equivalent to x.  The string x' is incompressible,  that is,  its complexity 
         differs from its length by at most 0 (logO(x)).
           P roof.  Let x' be (some) shortest description of x.  Then its length is C{x) and 
        its complexity differs from C{x) by at most a constant.  As we can algorithmically 
        transform x'  into x,  we have C(x \x')  =  0(1).  On the other hand,  the following 
        inequalities
                       C(x) ^ C{x,x') < C(x') < l{x') = C(x)
        hold up to a constant additive term.  As the leftmost and the rightmost terms in 
        these inequalities coincide, they are equalities.  In particular, C{x,x') ~ C{x).  The
