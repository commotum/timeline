             (Hint:  Let X be the set of all random (incompressible) strings of length n, and 
          let Y be the set of all random strings of length 2n.)
             As we have said, the idea to consider Л, V, —» as operations on problems (instead 
          of statements)  goes  back to  Kolmogorov  [76]  and Kleene  [75].  They used it  to 
          construct an interpretation for intuitionistic propositional calculus (IPC); see, e.g., 
          the textbook [200]  for more information about IPC.  In this chapter we consider 
          the  relation  between  provability  of a  formula  in  IPC  and  the  maximal  possible 
          complexity of problems generated by that formula.
             Let  Ф(p, q,...)  be a propositional formula with connectives Л, V, —> and with 
          variables p,q,....  Let X, Y,... be arbitrary problems (=sets of strings).  Substitute 
          X,Y,... for variables p, q,..., and let Ф(Х, Y,...) denote the resulting problem.
             There exists the following subtle problem regarding this definition.  Actually, 
          operations on problems depend on the choice of a pairing function x, y —> [x,y\ (con­
          junction and disjunction), on the choice of a programming language (implication), 
          and, finally, on the choice of the tags 0,  1  (disjunction).  However, this dependence 
          is quite weak:  Different choices lead to the problems whose complexities differ only 
          by 0 (1).
             More formally,  let  Ф(р, ç,...)  be  an  arbitrary  propositional  formula,  and  let 
          X, Y,...  be arbitrary problems  (sets).  Let  Ф'(Х, Y,...)  and  Ф"(Х, Y,...)  be two 
          problems obtained from Ф and X, Y,... by using different pairing functions ([x,y]', 
          [x,y]”),  different  programming languages  (U'(p,x)  =  [p]'(x),  U"(p,x)  =  \p]"(x))., 
          and, finally, different tags  (a',b' and a",b")  in the definition of disjunction.  Then 
          the difference between the complexities of problems Ф'(Х, Y,...) and Ф"(Х, Y,...) is 
          0(1).  (Recall that we assume that pairing functions are computable bijections and 
          programming languages are universal and have the Gödel property, in particular, 
          translation algorithms in both directions exist.)
             This claim is easily proved by induction.  More specifically, for every formula Ф 
          we construct by induction two computable functions:  ff2 that maps every solution 
          for the problem Ф'(Х, Y,...) to some solution for Ф"(Х, Y,...); and f21  that maPs 
          every solution for Ф"(Х, Y,...) to some solution for Ф'(Х, Y,...).
             For the propositional variable Ф both functions f ®2  and f21  are identity func­
          tions.  If Ф is  Ф Л 0,  and for Ф and 0 both functions are already constructed, we 
          define fi2  as follows.  The input string s is represented as s = [u, v]', then f^2  and 
          f ®2 are applied to и and v, respectively.  Finally, we apply the other pairing function 
          to the resulting strings.  The function f2l  is defined similarly.
             The case of disjunction is entirely similar.
             Now assume that Ф = Ф —> 0.  Then the function f ®2 can be defined as follows. 
          Consider the (computable) function V(s,b) = f^([s]'(f21(b))).  If s is a solution to 
          Ф'(Х, Y,...) —> 0'(X, Y,...)  and & is a solution to Ф"(Х, Y,...), then V(s, b) is a 
          solution to 0"(X, Y,...).  Consider Y as an interpreter of a programming language. 
          As U" has the Gödel property, there exists a translation algorithm that converts 
          Y-programs to [/"-programs.  Therefore there exists a total computable function 
          t:  £ —> £ such that  [t(s)]//(&) = V(s,b) for all s,b.  This function t can be used as

             Now we can relate the complexity of problems expressed by formulas to IPC: 
          If  a  formula  Ф(p,q...)  is  provable  in  IPC,  then  the  complexity  of the  problem
