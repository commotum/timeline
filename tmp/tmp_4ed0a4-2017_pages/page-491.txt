                                   GENERALIZATION FOR ARBITRARY COMPUTABLE DISTRIBUTIONS                                                           483
                    respect to a selection rule © if its generalized subsequence
                                                         b =                 a(m2),... ,a(mk),...),
                   obtained by this rule, satisfies the following requirement taken from the strong law 
                   of large numbers for quasi-Bernoulli distributions:
                                              a{mx) + ----V a{mk) _ p{mi) + • • • + p{mk)
                                                              к                                    к
                   as к —> oo.  Now we can define a stochastic sequence with respect to a given quasi- 
                   Bernoulli measure by requiring that for every Kolmogorov-admissible selection rule 
                   that  produces  an  infinite  generalized  subsequence  this  subsequence  is  stochastic 
                   with respect to this rule.
                          Remark.  By definition,  generalized subsequences are always infinite,  so the 
                   word  “infinite”  in the last sentence can be omitted.  However,  we use it to stress 
                   that we really are interested only in the infinite sequences, not tuples.
                          Now we want to extend the notion of Kolmogorov-stochasticness to a wider 
                   class of probability distribution.  First, let us introduce some notation.
                          Let n(l), n(2),..., n(k) be some natural numbers, and let г(1), i(2),..., i(k) be 
                   some bits.  By A1^ '                        we denote the set of all sequences a G Г2 such that
                   (*)                            ®n(l) — *(!)>  ®n(2) —                        ■ i  Q’n(k)  — i{k~).
                   The ratio                                               ип(1)- ■■■> n(k), m\ 
                                                                               l),...,i(fc), 1    )
                   is denoted in the sequel by
                                                                  ß m n(l), ..., n(k)\
                                                                        1     i{1),  • • •,  i{k)J
                   since it  is  the conditional probability of the event  “the mth  term of a equals  1” 
                   under condition (*).  That probability is undefined when the denominator equals 
                   zero.
                          Let us fix an arbitrarily sequence a e fi and some Kolmogorov-admissible se­
                   lection rule 0.  Our goal is to define the notion  “a is stochastic with respect to 0 ”. 
                   Recall that © was applied to select a subsequence of a in two steps.  First, we select 
                   an auxiliary generalized subsequence c; then the resulting subsequence is obtained 
                   by omitting some terms in c.  More precisely,
                                                            C      (®n( 1) ; ®n(2) ) • • • j Q‘n(k) )•••))
                   where the number n(k) is computed algorithmically given the tuple
                                                                 (®n( 1) i ®n(2) ) •  •  •  j Q"n(k—l)) •
                   Then,  using the same tuple as input,  the rule ©  decides whether the term an^.) 
                   should be included in the final subsequence b.  Therefore,
                                                   b = (a(n(ki)),a(n(k2)),...,a{n{kj)),...).
                   At both stages it may happen that 0 (the corresponding algorithm) does not pro­
                   duce any output (the number in the first case, and the decision bit in the second 
                   case).  Then b is finite and we do not require anything,  hence the sequence a is
