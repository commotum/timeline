                    Figure 25.  A possible occurrence of a forbidden string 2:  part of 
                    z is already in x, but к bits are missing.  This occurrence adds ck 
                    to wc(x).
                When c = 1/2, it is easy to explain the meaning of wc(x):  it is the expected 
            number of occurrences of forbidden strings that overlap x, assuming that x is ex­
            tended to the right by a sequence of independent random bits.  Having this inter­
            pretation in mind, it is easy to see that
                            wi/2 (x) = ±wl/2(x0) + ±w1/2(xl) -  ^ (l/2 )'(z).
                                                                zeF
            Indeed, we add 0 with probability 1/2 and add 1 with probability 1/2, and we need 
            to take into account that in this way we count also those occurrences that happen 
            immediately after x (and they should not be counted—the definition requires non­
            zero overlap with x).  In fact,  this equation is a purely combinatorial fact and is 
            valid for arbitrary c (assuming that x does not contain forbidden strings):
                                 wc(x) = cwc(x0) + cwc(x 1) — ^  c^z\
                                                              zeF
            Initially  (when x is empty) the value wc(x)  is zero,  and if x contains a forbidden 
            substring, then wc(x) is at least  1.  So it is enough to show that we can maintain 
            the invariant relation  “wc(x) < 1”  when adding the next bit.  It is enough to prove 
            that
                              wc(x0) + wc(xl) = - (wc(x) -I- ^  c'(z))  < 2
                                                  C          zÇF
            (assuming wc(x) < 1), and this does happen if 1 + J2zeF      < 2c.
                To finish the  proof of Theorem  157,  it  remains to make the sum  J2zeF °1^  
            finite by choosing c close enough to 1/2 (the value of c depends on a and becomes 
            closer to 1/2 as a approaches 1), and then to make this sum small by deleting the 
            strings of small lengths from F.
                I 248 I Using this argument, prove an effective version of Theorem 157.  If the set 
            F satisfies the conditions and is decidable, then there exists a computable sequence 
            that does not have short substrings from F.
                The result of the last problem can be extended to bi-infinite sequences (as noted 
            by K.  Makarychev):  One can also prove the existence of a computable bi-infinite 
            sequence with the same property.  (His argument follows Miller’s scheme,  but we 
            should define  “left”  and  “right”  emergency levels and look how they change when 
            several characters are added:  one of the levels should decrease significantly while 
            the other should not increase much.)  A more general argument is given in [159]; 
            it uses an effective version of Lovâsz local lemma (see the next section) and can be 
            generalized to multidimensional case.
