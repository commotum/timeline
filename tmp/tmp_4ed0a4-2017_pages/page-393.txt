                              12.8.  INFORMATION  FLOW  AND  NETWORK  CUTS               383
            vertices is less than e2 k, where e = 1/8; recall than N = 6n).  Since the bad vertices 
            in  Sa  can be enumerated  (given n,  k,  and A), the conditional complexity of each 
            of them given A is at most
                           log(2iV • 2k/nc) + O(logn) < к — clogn + О (log гг).
            Therefore,  for  large  enough  c  all  bad  vertices  have  conditional  complexity  (with 
            condition  A)  less  than  k,  and  C  is  not  bad  (its  complexity  is  exactly  k).  This 
            means that most values [xi{Ç)]k (more than Nj2) are good in Шк.
                A similar argument for the other graph shows that most of the values [Xi{C)\i 
            are good in Bh  Therefore there exists i which leads to good vertices in both cases. 
            Then X  = [Xi{C)]k  and X' = [xi{C)\i  have the required properties.          □
                 325  State  and prove  a similar  result  for  three  conditions  (or  polynomially
            many conditions).
                After  these  remarkable  results  are  proven,  one  may  want  to  go  farther  and 
            ask:  Is it possible to find for a given A one string of length к that can be used to 
            reconstruct A starting from m'bitrary В such that C(A\B) < к?  It is easy to see, 
            however, that it is too good to be true.
                Let к = nj2, and let AT be a string of length nj2 that satisfies this property 
            (i.e., C(A IX, B) æ 0 for every В such that C(A \ В) < n/2).  Then C(A \ X) should 
            be at most n/2, since we can take the half of the n-bit description of A for B.  Now 
            we can take X for B\ then the complexity of the pair (X, B) is at most n/2, and A 
            cannot be reconstructed.
                 326       Show that not only is one fingerprint not enough, but any fixed number 
            of fingerprints is not enough.
                (Hint:  Assume  that  d  strings  are  enough.  We  can  assume  without  loss  of 
            generality that all these strings are incompressible.  For some i, let us concatenate 
            г-bit  prefixes  of all  fingerprints  and  denote  this  string  by  Bi.  For  some  i  —  io 
            the conditional complexity C(A\Bi) is close to n/2 since it decreases continuously 
            from n to some value not exceeding n/2 (the latter because it is true even for one 
            fingerprint).  This io is at least n/2/c; none of the fingerprints can serve Bi0, since 
            each  of them  has  some  common  information  with  Bi0  and  the  total  amount  of 
            information is not enough.)
                             12.8.  Information flow and network cuts
                We have considered several types of information requests; for each type we have 
            found necessary and sufficient conditions for the request to be fulfillable.  In all our 
            examples these  conditions  can  be  obtained  in  some  uniform  way  using  network 
            cuts.  Let us  describe this  technique explicitly.  Consider  an  information  request 
            (a  directed  acyclic  graph  with  capacities,  input  and  output  vertices,  and  input 
            and output strings).  Let us formulate a necessary condition for this request to be 
            fulfillable.
                Choose some cut of the request graph, i.e., some set I of the graph nodes.  We 
            are  interested  in  the  information  flow  that  goes inside  I.  Consider  all the graph 
            edges that cross I in this direction (start outside I and end in I).  If there is some 
            unlimited capacity edge among them, we do not get any non-trivial conditions for 
            our /.  Assume that this is not the case and that all capacities u\,..., Uk are finite. 
            Let Vi,..., Vi  be the input strings for all input vertices in /,  and let W\,..., Wm
