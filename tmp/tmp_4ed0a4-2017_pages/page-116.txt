                                       4.6.  PROPERTIES  OF  PREFIX  COMPLEXITY                            101
              So the sum of m(x) over all binary strings of length n coincides with m(n)  (up 
              to  a constant factor).  Thus the average of m(x)  over all strings x of length n is 
              m(n)/2n (up to a constant factor).  The fraction of strings x, such that m(x) is 2d 
              times bigger than the average, is at most 2~d (Chebyshev’s inequality).                       □
                    106  Prove that the average prefix complexity of strings of length n is equal
              to n + K(n) + 0(1).
                   (A similar question for plain complexity was considered in Problem 3.)
                   Now we estimate the number of strings with complexity at most n.
                   Theorem 64.  The number of strings x with K(x) <n is 2n~-ftr(n)+0(1).
                   Proof.  Let cn be the number of strings x such that K(x) < n.  Let us rewrite 
              the basic property of prefix complexity (the convergence of the series ^  2~K                 in 
              terms of cn.  There are exactly cn+1 — cn  strings of complexity n.  Therefore the 
              series
                                                   ^ 2 “n(cn+i -  Cn)
                                                    П
              converges.  Regrouping the terms of this series, we conclude that
                                       £(2-<"-‘) _ 2~n)cn =             2 ~ n Cn  < oo-
              Since the function cn  is lower semicomputable,  this implies that 2  ncn  does not 
              exceed the a priori probability m(n) of n.  Hence cn ^ m(n)2n = 2n  K(n)  (up to a 
              constant factor).
                   On the other hand, it is easy to construct an upper semicomputable function 
              к whose values are natural numbers (and Too) that takes the value n on (approxi­
              mately) m(n)2n arguments.  This can be done in many ways.  For example, let us 
              agree that for a string x of length n the value k(x)  can be either +oo or n;  it is 
              equal to n if the ordinal number of x  (in the list of all n-bit strings)  is less than 
              m(n)2n.
                   For this  function  A:,  the  series  ^ 2 ”^     converges.  So  K(x)  ^  k(x) + 0(1), 
              hence cn+o(i)  ^ m(n)2n.  Both m(n) and 2n change at most by a constant factor 
              as n increases by 1.  Thus m(n)2n = 0(cn).                                                    □
                   These results may create an impression that prefix and plain complexity mea­
              sure essentially the same quantity but using slightly different scales, so the prefix 
              complexity is (slightly) bigger just because of the shifted scale.  Or, maybe, is there 
              a more fundamental difference?  This question can be formalized as follows:  Are 
              there  two  sequences  an  and  bn  of strings  such  that  C(an) — C(bn)  —>  Too  but 
              K(an) — К (bn)  —>  — oo?  This  question was  answered  by  An.  A.  Muchnik  and 
              S. Positselsky who proved that sequences with these properties do exist [137].  An­
              other proof was provided by J.  Miller in  [122];  this paper contains other results 
              about the relation between plain and prefix complexities, but we restrict ourselves 
              to several simple remarks (see also Section 4.7.4, p.  112).
