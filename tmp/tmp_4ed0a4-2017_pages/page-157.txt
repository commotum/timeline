       of isomorphic trees.  The strategy at each iteration does the following.  First of all, 
       we increase up to e the requests for those sons of the roots whose request already 
       exceeds e — e/6k.  After Server’s move we check how many sons of the roots do 
       not have a reserved interval yet.  If more that 25% of them do not have a reserved 
       interval, for each son that does not have a reserved interval we select an unprocessed 
       son (who is a grandson of one of the roots).  For this family of grandsons we perform 
       a recursive call of the strategy with parameter k, and a is chosen as a power of 2 in 
       the interval  (e/(12k),e/(6k)].  We repeat this procedure until the fraction of sons 
       that do not have a reserved interval becomes less than 25%.
          For every recursive call the sum of all requests increases by (3/4)m(e/(12fc2)) 
       or  more,  where  m  is  a  total  number  of sons  of all  roots.  And  the  sum  of the 
       requests for all roots cannot exceed me:  we guarantee that every son of every root 
       has request at most e (after that the reserved interval is guaranteed).  So the total 
       number of recursive calls is at most 0(k2).  Moreover, each root has request at most 
       a, since each root has a/e sons.  The total size of the newly grayed area is at least 
       the total length of all the reserved intervals, and it is at least (3/4)me, as required. 
       It remains to estimate the ratio (newly grayed area)/(total sum of requests).
          Let 7 be the sum of increases for root  requests,  if we do not  count  the last 
       increases that created reserved intervals.  This increase creates a k'y increase in the 
       grayed area, if we do not count the reserved intervals.  In total we obtain a grayed 
       area of size  к7 + (3/4)me  by  making requests  at  most  for 7 + m(e/6k).  Since 
       7 ^ me, the first number is at least к + 1/2 times greater than the second one:
                    k'y + (3/4)me ^ (к + l/2)(7 + me/6k)
       (a simple computation).
          It remains to bound the branching factor of the tree T needed for this construc­
       tion by a function of к and the ratio a/e (it is easy to see that only the ratio of these 
       numbers is important).  As we have discussed (after constructing of a strategy for 
       infinite trees), we should first compare <5 and e and prove that one can use Ö — e/c^ 
       for some sequence Ck that does not grow too fast.
          For к — 1 we had <5 = e, so C\  = 1.  The strategy for к + 1/2 makes at most 
       0(k2)  recursive  calls  of ^-strategy,  and  its  e/<5-ratio  is  the  product  of the  same 
       ratios for recursive calls, multiplied by the ratio e/e', where e is the parameter of 
       the game and s' is the similar parameter for the last recursive call.  The latter ratio 
       does not exceed 12A:, because the last call is made with parameter a' that is at least 
       e/(12k), and we can use the same value of e1.  So we get a recurrent formula
                         Cfc+1/2 = 0{kc°(k }),
       which gives Cfc = 2°(fe^4(A  1}.
          Now it is easy to bound the branching factor for the tree T by a function of к 
       and a/e.  Recall that in the construction of (k + l/2)-strategy we used a tree with 
       branching factor a/e in the root and 0(k2) in the sons of the root.  So at all odd 
       levels  (the root  level is 0)  the branching factor is 0(k2)\  it remains to bound the 
       branching on levels 2,4,....  At level 2 the branching factor is again equal to the 
       ratio a!/s' of the parameters of the strategies used.  It is easy to see that this ratio 
       does not depend on the original a and e.  Indeed, calling the strategy recursively 
       for the grandsons, we use the value of a' that does not exceed e/ (6k) and the value 
       of e'  that is at  least e/c*.+1/2-  Therefore, the branching factors for the grandsons
