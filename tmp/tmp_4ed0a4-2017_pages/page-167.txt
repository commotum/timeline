                                                                5.6.   LEVIN-SCHNORR THEOREM                                                           153
                    F contains                       strings of length n, and each of these strings can be described
                    (when n and other parameters of the construction are given) by n — f(n) bits.  This 
                    gives  an upper bound for the complexity of all the strings in F.  Note also that 
                    every infinite sequence that is covered by our intervals has a prefix in F.
                           Now we return to the proof.  Consider the largest effectively null set.  For each 
                    £ > 0 there exists its cover by intervals of total length at most e, and we can use the 
                    construction above to get the corresponding function /  with Y^,n 2“^ n*  ^ £•  We 
                    need to combine those functions for different e into one function /  as the theorem 
                    requires.  This is done as follows.
                           For  each  c  =  0,1,2,...,  consider  the  covering  by  a family  of intervals  with 
                    total  measure  not  exceeding  2~3c,  the  corresponding set  Fc  of strings,  and  the 
                    corresponding function /.  Then we decrease /  by 2c and obtain a function fc such 
                    that
                                                                          ^ 2 " /c(n) < 2~c
                                                                           П
                    (we get 2~c instead of 2"3c since we have decreased /  by 2c).  The set Fc contains 
                    2n-fc(n)-2c  b r in g s   of length n, and every non-random sequence has a prefix in Fc.
                           Then f{n) is defined by the equation
                                                                       2 ~f(n) —            2~fc(nK
                                                                                        C
                    This guarantees that
                                      E*■f(n)                                            J2J22~fc(n) <                            ^ L
                    On the other hand, the set Fc is enumerable given c (according to the definition of 
                    an effectively null set), so any element x of length n is determined (when n and c 
                    are known) by its ordinal number (in the enumeration of strings of length n in Fc), 
                    i.e.,  by n — fc{n) — 2c bits,
                                                           C(x I n, c) < n -  f c(n) -  2c + 0(1),
                    which implies
                                              C{x\n) < n — fein) — 2c + O(logc) < n — f(n) — c
                    for any x G Fc of length n (for large enough c).
                          Now let  Ш  be  any  non-random  sequence.  As  we  have  seen,  for  each  c  the 
                    sequence и has a prefix in Fc.  Let n be the length of this prefix.  Then
                                                                  C((w)n|n) < n - f[n) -  c
                    (assuming that c is large enough), which contradicts our assumption.
                          However, this does not complete the proof, since we need a computable function 
                    /, and the set Fc is only enumerable, so we do not know when all strings of length n 
                    have been appeared, and therefore cannot compute /.  To overcome this difficulty, 
                    recall that we started with a family of intervals (that cover the largest effectively null 
                    set).  In this covering we may split a large interval flz into many small intervals Qzt 
                    (for all strings t of some length).  This allows us to make fc computable if we require 
                    (without loss of generality)  that the length of the intervals in the enumeration of 
                    Fc can only increase.  The same argument can be applied to all fc in parallel and 
                    makes / computable.
