                                                          1.1.   DEFINITION  AND  MAIN  PROPERTIES                                                          19
                     and
                                                                         f(x) —  lim  F(x, к)
                                                                                      к—>oo
                    for all X.  The values of F are natural numbers as well as the special constant +oo. 
                    The requirements imply that for every к the value F(x, к)  is an upper bound of 
                    f(x).  This upper bound becomes more precise as к increases.  For every x there 
                    is a A: for which this upper bound is tight.  However, we do not know the value of 
                    that k.  (If there is an algorithm that given any x finds such к, then the function / 
                    is computable.)  Evidently, any computable function is upper semicomputable.
                           A function / is upper semicomputable if and only if the set
                                                                     Gf = {(x,n) I f(x) < n}
                    is enumerable.  This set is sometimes called the “upper graph of / ”, which explains 
                    the strange names “upper semicomputable”  and “enumerable from above”.
                           Let us verify this.  Assume that  a function /  is upper semicomputable.  Let 
                    F(x,k) be the function from the definition of semicomputability.  Then we have
                                                                  f(x) < n             3k F(x, к) < n.
                    Thus,  performing in parallel the computations of F(x, к)  for all x and k,  we can 
                    generate all the pairs in the upper graph of /.
                           Assume now that the set Gf is enumerable.  Fix an algorithm enumerating this 
                    set.  Then define F(x, к)  as the best  upper bound of / obtained after к steps of 
                    generating elements in Gf.  That is,  F(x,k)  is equal to the minimal n such that 
                    the  pair  (x, n + 1)  has  been  printed  after  к  steps.  If there  is  no  such  pair,  let 
                    F(x, k) — Too.
                           Using  the  notion  of an  upper  semicomputable  function,  we  can  reformulate 
                    Theorem 7 as follows.
                           Theorem 8.  (a)  The function C is upper semicomputable and
                                                                        \{x I C(x) < n}\ < 2n
                    for all n.
                           (b)            If a function C'  is upper semicomputable  and |{x  |  C'{x)  <  n}\  <  2n for 
                    all n,  then C(x) ^ C'{x) + c for som,e c and for all x.
                           Note that the upper bound 2n of the cardinality of \{x \ C'{x) < n}\  in item 
                    (b) can be replaced by a weaker upper bound 0(2n).
                           Theorem 8 allows us to define Kolmogorov complexity as a minimal (up to an 
                    additive constant) upper semicomputable function к that satisfies the inequality
                                                                    \{x I k(x) < n}\ ^ 0(2n).
                    One can replace the requirement of minimality in this definition by some other prop­
                    erties of G.  In this way we obtain the following axiomatic definition of Kolmogorov 
                    complexity [173]:
                           Theorem 9.  Let к be a natural-valued function defined on binary strings.  As­
                    sume that к satisfies the following properties:
                           (a)  к  is upper semicomputable  (enumerability axiom);
                           (b) for every partial computable function A from E to E,  the inequality
                                                                         k(A(x)) ^ k(x) + c
