             300          9.  FREQUENCY AND GAME APPROACHES TO RANDOMNESS
                 Before proving this statement, let us note that it directly implies statement (b) 
            of Theorem  196.  Note also that  for a random sequence the numbers pi  are well 
            defined:  the  denominator p(x)  in p{xl)/p{x)  is  non-zero  for  a random sequence 
             (otherwise Q.x is an effectively null set).
                 PROOF.  Consider one more measure ß that averages the conditional probabil­
            ities for ß and p!.  Namely, the probability of 1 after x for ß" is an average of two 
            similar probabilities for ß and ß'.  (Note that ß" is not an average of ß and ß1:  if 
            we let ß(X) = (ß(X) + ß'(X))/2, we also get a measure, but a different one.)
                 Since the sequence to is random with respect to ß, we can use the Levin-Schnorr 
            criterion
                                                     n— 1
                                  KA (ш0 • • • LJn-i) = £ ( - 1 о ё гч) + 0(1),
                                                      i=0
            where (as before) n = pi if     = 1 and r* = (1 — pi) otherwise.  Similar equality is 
            valid for r[ that correspond to p!.  For the intermediate measure ß and corresponding 
            fi we know only the inequality (the upper bound for complexity).
                Thus, we have the following inequalities for conditional probabilities:
                                    n—1            n—1
                                    £(-logr;) ^ £ (-1 о 6тч) + 0(1),
                                    i=0             i=0
                                    n—1            n—1
                                    £ ( - 10^ )  < £(-iogfi) + o(i).
                                    i=0             i—0
            Taking the average of these two inequalities, we get
                             E  (-bgrO + C-logri) ^ g (_ logfJ + 0(1)
                                                          i=0
            Recalling that fi = (г* + г[)/2, we get
                          ^ ( (-‘ogn) + (-togfi) _  ( - b g ^ - t d ) )   <0(1).
            Each summand in the left-hand side is non-negative  (the logarithm is a concave 
            function) and is (up to a 0(l)-factor) equal to (г* — r()2, so
                                     £ ( n  -  A f ~ £ ( р { -  p'if < oo,
            as we claimed.
                (This  argument  has  a subtle  point  which  needs  to  be  mentioned.  We  con­
            sider the average of conditional probabilities, which creates a problem if one of the 
            measures has zero values:  In this case the computation of conditional probabilities 
            never terminates.  So the average measure ß is in fact a semimeasure,  but this is 
            enough for us (since the upper bound for complexity is still valid, and to never goes 
            through problematic points being random with respect to both measures).           □
                Note that this theorem says only that ß and ß' are close to each other along uj 
            (that is random with respect to both).  Of course, they can be completely different 
            in other parts of the Cantor space.
