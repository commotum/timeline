            54                         3.  MARTIN-LOF  RANDOMNESS
            Then fi is called a measure on Q, and the value ß{Ä) is called the measure of the 
            set A.  The set A for which ц(А) is defined, is called /r-measurable.
                A  measure  fi  such  that  //(Г2)  =  1  is  called  a  probability  distribution  on  Q. 
            Elements of the cr-algebra that is the domain of /j are called  events,  and /j(A)  is 
            called the probability of the event A.
                Any measure is monotone (А С В implies /r(A) ^ ß{B)).  Indeed,
                                       р(В)-1л{А) = ц{В\А)> 0.
                Another important property of measures is continuity:  if a set В is a union of 
            increasing sequence of sets
                                           B0 c Bx C B2 C • • •  ,
            then ß(Bn) tends to ti(B) as n    oo.  (Indeed, let us apply the additivity property 
            to  all  sets  Ai  =  Д  \ Д -i  and  then  to  all  sets  Аг  such  that  i  ^  n.)  A  similar 
            property holds for decreasing sequences of sets.
                For any measure /j on Q let us consider a function p defined of binary strings
            as
                                              p(x) = n(Qx).
            This function has non-negative real values and satisfies the additivity property
                                           p(x) = p(x 0) +p{x 1)
            for  any string x.  (Indeed,  the interval Qx  is the union of its two halves Qxq  and 
            ПХ1, which are disjoint sets.)
                As we know from measure theory (the Lebesgue theorem), an inverse transition 
            is possible.  Namely,  for every additive function p on binary strings that has non­
            negative real values, the Lebesgue theorem provides a measure pi such that /x(Qx) = 
            p(x) for all binary strings x.
                The measure provided by the Lebesgue theorem has the following additional 
            property:  if /r(A) = 0 for some set A and В C A, then pi(B) is defined (and therefore 
            pt(B)  =  0).  In  the  sequel  we  consider  only  measures  that  have  this  additional 
            property.
                We do not explain the Lebesgue construction here but refer the reader to any 
            textbook in measure theory,  e.g.,  [81,  63].  However,  let  us  recall  the definition 
            of sets  having measure 0,  since the Martin-Löf definition of randomness  uses its 
            effective version.
                Let p be an additive non-negative real-valued function on strings.  We call p(x) 
            the measure of the interval Qx.  A subset A C fl is a null set  (a set  of measure 0) 
            if for every e > 0 there exist a finite or countable family of intervals that cover A 
            and have total measure at most e.
                In other words,  a set  A is a null set if there exists a function  (e,i)  (->■ x(s,i) 
            (the first argument is a positive real, the second argument is a non-negative integer; 
            values are binary strings) such that
                   •  A C  f^x(e,0) LI    U f^x(e52) ' ' '  cUld
                   •  p(x(e, 0)) + p(x{e, 1)) + p{x{e, 2)) + • • ■ ^ e
            for every positive e.  Note that the family of intervals can be finite, since we do not 
            require the function x to be total (undefined values are skipped both in the union 
            and in the sum).
