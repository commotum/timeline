         strings.  This situation is typical also for computational complexity:  usually upper 
         and lower bounds for complexity of some computational problem are asymptotic 
         bounds.
                          Complexity and information
            One can consider the Kolmogorov complexity of x as the amount of informa­
         tion in x.  Indeed,  a string of zeros, which has a very short description,  has little 
         information, and a chaotic string, which cannot be compressed, has a lot of informa­
         tion (although that information can be meaningless—we do not try to distinguish 
         between meaningful and meaningless information; so, in our view, any abracadabra 
         has much information unless it has a short description).
           If  the  complexity  of a  string  x  is  equal  to  k,  we  say  that  x  has  к  bits  of 
         information.  One can expect that the amount of information in a string does not 
         exceed its length, that is, C(x) ^ l(x).  This is true (up to an additive constant, as 
         we have already said).
           Theorem 2.  There is a constant c such that
                                C(x) ^ l(x) + c
         for all strings x.
           PROOF.  Let  D(y)  =  у  for all y.  Then  Cd{x) = l(x).  By optimality,  there 
         exists some c such that
                           C(x) ^ Cd{x) + c — l(x) + c 
         for all x.                                             □
           Usually this statement is written as follows:  C(x)  ^ l(x) + 0(1). Theorem 2 
         implies,  in particular,  that Kolmogorov complexity is always finite,  that is,  every 
         string has a description.
           Here is another property of “amount of information”  that one can expect:  the 
         amount of information does not increase when algorithmic transformation is per­
         formed.  (More precisely, the increase is bounded by an additive constant depending 
         on the transformation algorithm.)
           Theorem 3.  For every algorithm A there exists a constant c such that
                              C(A(x)) < C(x) + c 
        for all x such that A(x)  is defined.
           PROOF.  Let D be an optimal decompressor that is used in the definition of 
         Kolmogorov complexity.  Consider another decompressor D'\
                               D'{p) = A{D{p)).
         (We apply first D and then A.)  If p is a description of a string x with respect to D 
         and A(x) is defined, then p is a description of A(x) with respect to D'.  Let p be a 
         shortest description of x with respect to D.  Then we have
                         Cdi(A(x)) ^ l(p) = Cd(x) = C(x).
         By optimality we obtain
                        C(A(x)) ^ Cd.(A(x)) + c ^ C(x) + c
         for some c and all x.                                  □
