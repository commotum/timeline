                            4.  A  PRIORI  PROBABILITY  AND  PREFIX  COMPLEXITY
            84
                It is easy to verify that the mapping y i-> {p}(y) is prefix free for every p and 
            coincides with the mapping y i-a p(y) if the latter one is prefix free.  The rest of the 
            proof repeats the corresponding part from the proof of Theorem 48.              □
                Let  us  fix  some  optimal  prefix-free  decompressor,  and  let  K'(x)  denote  the 
            corresponding complexity.
                Which of the complexity measures К and K'  is  “the right  one”?  This is  a 
            matter  of taste.  We will  prove  in  Section 4.5  that  these  measures  differ  by  an 
            additive constant (and that both complexities coincide with the negative logarithm 
            of the a priori probability).  Thus the question is which of the two definitions (of the 
            same prefix complexity) is more natural.  Again this is a matter of taste.  Authors 
            believe that the definition based on prefix-stable functions is more natural than the 
            other one (which explains why we started with it).  However, sometimes the second 
            definition is more convenient.  For instance,  its use makes easier the proof of the 
            theorem on the complexity of a pair (Section 4.6).
                One can find the historical account in [18]  (see also the arXiv version of this 
            paper);  making the story  short,  let  us  mention  only that  prefix complexity was 
            independently introduced by Levin who used prefix-stable decompressors (and de­
            noted prefix complexity by KP) and Chaitin who used prefix-free ones (and denoted 
            prefix complexity by H).  Now most English-language papers, following [103], use 
            letter К for prefix complexity.
                The properties of К and K' are similar to those of the plain complexity but- 
            differ in some important aspects:
                   •  We start with a comparison of C and К :
                           C(x)^K(x) + 0( 1)  and  C(x) ^K'(x) + 0( 1).
                     These properties are straightforward, as both prefix-stable and prefix-free 
                     decompressors form a subclass in the class of all decompressors.
                   •  Recall that C(x) ^ /(ж)+0(1), as the optimal decompressor is better than 
                     the identity function.  This argument is not valid for prefix complexity, as 
                     the identity function is neither prefix stable nor prefix free.  We will show 
                     in Section 4.5 that this inequality is false for the prefix complexity.
                   •  Nevertheless there is  an upper bound for prefix complexity in terms of 
                     the length.  We will provide such bounds for K',  and the same bounds 
                     hold for K, the proofs being entirely similar.  Let us show that K'(x)  ^ 
                     2l(x) + 0(1).  Indeed, consider a decompressor
                                               D(x01) — X
                     where x stands for the string obtained by doubling all bits  in x.  This 
                     decompressor is prefix free and K d(x) = 2l(x) + 2.  By replacing 5Ю1 by 
                     a more efficient  self-delimiting encoding x,  we  can obtain better upper 
                     bounds.  For example, letting x = Ып(/(х))01.т, we obtain the bound
                                    K'(x) < l(x) + 21og/(x) + 0(1).
                     By iterating the construction, we obtain the bound
                              K'(x) ^ l(x) + logl(x) + 21oglog/(x) + 0(1)
                     and so on.
