          364                   11.  COMMON  INFORMATION
          holds with 0 (log 7V)-precision, while the complexities of x and y and their mutual 
          information is proportional to  N  (with the same precision)  with non-zero coeffi­
          cients.
             In this way we get one more construction of strings with non-extractable mutual 
          information.  They are stochastic (as in the geometric construction), and we (a bit 
          mysteriously) avoided any combinatorial considerations.
              314  We have already seen (Theorem 217, p. 342) that there exist conditionally 
          independent random variables a and ß,  both having the uniform distribution in 
          {0,1},  such that Pr[a = ß\  = 5/8.  Prove that this statement remains true if we 
          replace 5/8 by arbitrary c G [3/8, 5/8].
             However, if c is close to 0 or 1, a similar statement is not true:  one cannot add 
          7 and Ö to make these two variables conditionally independent.  Nevertheless,  for 
          eveiy c G (0,1) we can still prove that the common information is not extractable 
          (for most of the strings obtained by N trials for these a and ß).  We split this result 
          into the following two problems.
              315  Consider an arbitrary c G  (0,1).  Prove that there exist finite chains of 
          random variables ao, ai,..., otk and ßo,ßi,  .., ßk defined on some common prob-
          ability space such that
               •  ao  and ßo are uniformly distributed in {0,1};
               •  Pr[a0 = ßo] - c;
               •  O.Q  and ßo  are independent given an ;
               •  ao  and ßo are independent given ß\ ;
               •  a i  and ßi  are independent given 0:2;
               •  a\  and ßi  are independent given Д2;
               •  ak- 1  and ßk- 1  are independent given ak',
               •  ak-i  and ßk-i  are independent given ßk',
               •  ak and ßk are independent.
             (Hint:  If this statement is true for some c,  it  is also true for c' —  (c2 + l)/2. 
          To show this,  we may apply the construction used to prove Theorem 217,  using 
          the c-construction for 7  and  Ö.  One should  correct  the distributions  of the pair 
          a,ß under the conditions 7  =  0,  Ö —  1  and 7  =  1,5  =  0 in  such  a way that  a 
          and ß become independent given 7 and given Ö.  Finally,  one should check that 
          every number between 1/2 and 1 can be obtained from some number in (1/2,5/8) 
          by several iterations of the function с и   (c2 + l)/2.  To prove the statement for 
          c < 1/ 2, we invert one of the variables (say, a).)
             316      Assume that  a  and ß  satisfy  the  statement  of the  previous  problem. 
          Consider the set  of pairs of binary strings x,y of length n where the frequencies 
          of all  pairs  follow  the  distribution  for  (a,ß).  Prove  that  a random  (maximally 
          complex)  pair  in  this  set  has  significant  (proportional  to  n)  mutual  information 
          but no extractable common information.  More precisely, for every г the inequality 
          K(z)
               ^ 0 (K(z I x) + K{z I y) + log n) holds (the constant in О-notation may depend 
          on the length к of the chain).
             The solution of Problem 315 can be generalized for non-binary alphabets and 
          non-uniform distributions.  There is a simple criterion to decide whether the random 
          variables a, ß  (their common distribution)  satisfy the statement  of Problem  315. 
          This happens if and only if one cannot permute the rows and columns of the matrix
