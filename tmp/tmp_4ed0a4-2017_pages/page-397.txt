                                  Figure 46.  Field F2 is not enough.
                Let us change our setting and consider elements of an arbitrary field F instead 
            of bits  (elements of F2).  The input is now a vector from Fn ;  an edge of capacity 
            к  carries  an  element  of Fk,  and  transformations  in  the  nodes  are  F-linear,  i.e., 
            determined by matrices with elements from F.
                Let us show that for a large enough field F one can find the transformations 
            in the nodes that make all the output mappings invertible at the same time.  Let 
            us consider the matrix elements as F-valued variables.  Then the elements of the 
            resulting input-output matrices are polynomials in these variables.  The determi­
            nants of these matrices are also  polynomials.  The degree of a determinant  as a 
            polynomial in matrix elements is bounded by nE, where E is the number of edges 
            in the graph (going from input to output, we increase the degree of the polynomial 
            by 1, and by computing the determinant we multiply the degree at most by n).  So 
            for each output we have a polynomial of a limited degree (the determinant of the 
            corresponding matrix), and we know that this polynomial is not equal to 0 (since 
            we can make the matrix invertible for each output separately).  It remains to use 
            the following simple algebraic result:
                Lemma.  A polynomial of degree d inm variables or over a field F is either equal 
            to 0  (has zero coefficients)  or is equal to zero in a random point with probability at 
            most d/\F\.
                Here by degree we mean total degree (exponents for all variable are added), |F| 
            stands for the cardinality of F, and the probability is taken over uniform distribu­
            tion in Fm.
                Proof.  We use induction over m.  For m = 1 the claim says that the number of 
            roots of a univariate polynomial is bounded by its degree (factorization argument). 
            For  m  >  1,  we  represent  the  given  polynomial  as  a polynomial  in  one  variable 
            whose coefficients are polynomials in the remaining variables.  Let d\ be the degree 
            of this univariate polynomial (the maximal exponent for the selected variable), and 
            let  d2  be  the  degree  of its  leading coefficient  (as  a polynomial  in  the  remaining 
            variables).  This leading coefficient may be zero or not depending on the values of 
            the remaining variables.  The probability for it to be zero is bounded by d2/\F\ 
            due  to  the  induction  assumption,  and  if the  leading  coefficient  is  not  zero,  the 
            probability to bump into a root of the non-zero univariate polynomial of degree d\ 
            is bounded by d\/\F\.  In total we get (0Î2 +d\)/\F\ ^ d/\F\.  The lemma is proven.
