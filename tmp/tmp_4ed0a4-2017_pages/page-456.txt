             therefore all elements of T are covered.  (Instead of a greedy algorithm one may 
             use a probabilistic argument and show that randomly chosen in2s~k In 2 sets from 
             S cover T with positive probability;  however, our goal is to construct  an explicit 
             strategy.)
                 Anyway, the number of sets selected by a substrategy number s does not exceed 
                                         т28-к(\п2)21- 8 =in2i~k\n2,
             and we get at most i2n2l~k In 2 for all substrategies.
                 It  remains to prove that  after each move of the second player every string x 
             that belongs to 2k or more sets of the first player also belongs to some selected set. 
             For the tth move we consider the binary representation of t,
                                  t = 2Sl + 2S2 + • ■ •  ,  where si  > S2 > 1 • •  •
             Since x does not belong to the sets selected by substrategies number si, S2, ■.., the 
             multiplicity  of x  among the first  2Sl  sets  is  less  than  2k/i,  the  multiplicity  of x 
             among the next 2S2 sets is also less than 2k/i, etc.  For those j with 2Sj  < 2k/i, the 
             multiplicity of x among the respective portion of 2si sets is obviously less than 2k ji. 
             Therefore,  we conclude that the total multiplicity of x is less than i ■ 2k/i = 2k, 
             and the second player does not  need to  care about  x.  This finishes the explicit 
             construction of the winning strategy.
                 Now we can assume without loss of generality that the winning strategy has 
             complexity at most 0(log(n + к + i + j)).  (In the probabilistic argument we have 
             proved the existence of a winning strategy, but then we can perform the exhaustive 
             search until we find one; the first strategy found will have small complexity.)  Then 
             we use this simple strategy to play against the strategy of the second player which 
             enumerates all .Д-sets of complexity less than i and size 2^  (or less).  The selected 
             sets can be described by their ordinal numbers (among the selected sets), so their 
             complexity is bounded by i — к (with logarithmic precision).  Every string that has 
             2 k different (г*^-descriptions in A will also have one among the selected sets, and 
             that is what we need.                                                                □
                 As before (for arbitrary sets), this result implies that explanation with minimal 
             parameters are simple with respect to the explaining object:
                 Theorem 259.  Let A be an enumerable family of finite sets.  If a string x has 
             an (i * j)-description A € A such that C(A\x)  <  k,  then x  has  an ((г — к) * j)- 
             description in A.  If the family A satisfies condition (3)  on p.  439,  then x has also 
             an (i * (j — k))-description in A.
                 As usual, we omit the logarithmic corrections needed in the exact statement of 
             this result.
                 Historical remark.  All the results from this section, including non-trivial exer­
             cises,  are from  [204].  The probabilistic proof of Theorem 258 was independently 
             proposed by Michal Kouckÿ and Andrei Muchnik.
                              14.5.  Optimality and randomness deficiency
                 We have considered two ways to measure how bad a finite A is as an explanation 
             for a given object x:  the first is the randomness deficiency that was defined as
                                         d{x\A) = log # A — C{x I A) ;
