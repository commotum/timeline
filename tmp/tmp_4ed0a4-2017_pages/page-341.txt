                                            10.7.   COMBINATORIAL INTERPRETATION:  EXAMPLES                                                  329
                         A more precise formulation of the statement would be for every u, v and for 
                   every set A of pairs that has at most 2U+V elements, there exist
                              •  a set В of size at most 2U\
                              •  a set  C of pairs that contains at most 2V  pairs with the same first com­
                                 ponent
                   such that for every (x, y) € A either x G В or (x, y) € C (or both).
                         In fact the proof of the formula for the complexity of a pair used exactly this 
                   approach:  For a given x and y, we looked at how many pairs with the same x have 
                   small complexity.  If there are only few of them,  then C(y |x) was small  (now we 
                   say that the pair  (x,y) belongs to C); if there are many of those pairs, then C(x) 
                   is small  (because this can happen only for few values of x).  (Now we say that x 
                   belongs to B.)
                          288  Translate the arguments used to prove the formula for the complexity of
                   a pair to give a formal proof of the combinatorial statement in question.
                         Now consider an inequality where both sides have more than one term:
                                              C{xx) + ^(х^хг^з) < C(xi,x2) + C(x2,x3).
                   (We called it a basic inequality; it is true with an O(logiV) error term for strings 
                  of complexity at most N.)
                         In  terms  of a  binary  relation  C(x)  <  n,  this  inequality  can  be  restated  as 
                  follows:
                                 If C(xi, X2) < a, C(xi, X3)  < 6, and a + b — p + q, then at least 
                                 one of the inequalities C(x 1) < p and C(x 1,Х2,хз) < q holds.
                   (For the sake of brevit)', we omit all the details about 0(log iV)-precision.)
                         The natural combinatorial translation of this statement looks as follows:
                                 If A C X\ x A2 x A3, тл( 1,2) < 2“, m^( 1,3) ^ 2Ь, and a + b — 
                                p + q, then there exist B,C С A1XA2XA3 such that A C BuC, 
                                 niß( 1 ) ^ 2P, and mc(l,2,3) ^ 2q.
                         Eliminating the variables a and b, we can rewrite this statement  (in a multi­
                  plicative version):
                                 If A C X\ xX‘2 x A3 and тл( 1, 2)-тл(1,3) = l-V for some /, V >
                                 0, then the set A can be covered by two sets В and C such that 
                                 T7iß(l) < I and mc(l,2,3) < V.
                         In geometric terms, if some set A has small projections 011 the planes 1, 2 and
                   1,3,  its length in direction 1  (the size of the projection on the first coordinate) and 
                  its volume (the cardinality of A) can both be large.  But we can split A into two 
                  parts В and C in such a way that В has small length and C has small volume.
                         (Recalling the example with two parallelepipeds, we see that in this example 
                  В could be the large one and C can be the small one.)
                         Of course, these heuristic arguments are not proofs.  But in fact the last state­
                  ment is indeed true (though not completely trivial).  Here is its proof.
                         Consider the projection of the set  A onto the  1, 2-plane;  this projection is  a 
                  subset of Ai x A2, and we denote it by A12.  For every x G Ai consider the section 
                  of this projection (pairs with first component x).  Let n2{;x) be the cardinality of 
                  this section.  Then
                                                            m(l,2) = |Ai2| = ^ n 2(x)
