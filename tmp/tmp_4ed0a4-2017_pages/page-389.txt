            C(A\B) — C(B\A),  and together with the first  part  makes possible  the reverse 
            transformation.
                Here is the formal statement:
                Theorem 233.  Assume that C(A \B) < k, C(B\ A) < I, and к > I.  Then there 
            exists a k-bit string X  such that C(X\A,B) — 0(\ogk), C(A\B,X)  = O(logZc), 
            and C(B\A,X') = O(logfc)  where X' is an l-bit prefix of X.
                P r o o f.  Let  us  use  the same trick with  2l+1  colors,  still  requiring that  each 
            left  vertex has different colors of adjacent edges,  but on the right side up to 2 k~l 
            adjacent edges of the same color are allowed.  Then the color X of edge A-В allows 
            us to find В given A, and in the other direction we need the color plus the number of 
            edge A-В in the enumeration of all £?-edges of color X (as they are generated).  □
                 323       Prove the statement of Theorem 233 in the form used in [9]:  Under the 
            assumptions of Theorem 233, there exist a string Y of length к — I and a string X 
            of length I such that C(B,Y \ A,X) = 0(\ogk) and C(A\B,Y, X) = 0(logk).
                            12.7.  Conditional codes for two conditions
                Let us now consider an information request that in some sense generalizes the 
            two last examples (Figure 42).
                For the case A = В we get the request from Section  12.3  (in two symmetric 
            copies).  If we let C — (A, В), we get essentially the same request as in Section 12.6 
            (in each of the output vertices one string is known, and to restore the pair means 
            to restore the other one).
                It is easy to state the necessary conditions for this request to be fulfillable:
                                     C{C\A) < к,     C(C\B) < k.
            Muchnik [135] has shown that these conditions in fact are also sufficient.  Here is 
            the exact statement:
                Theorem 234.  Let A, B, and C be arbitrary strings of complexity at most n, 
            and let к be a positive integer such that C(C\ A) < к and C(C\B) ^ k.  Then there 
            exists  a string X  of length at most к + O(logn)  such that C(X\C)  =  O(logn), 
            C(C\A,X) = O(logn),  and C{C\B,X) = O(logn).
                In programming terms this statement can be rephrased as follows.  For every 
            three strings А, В, C there exists a program of complexity at most
                                   max(C(C I A), C{C \ B)) + O(logn)
                                           A              В
