            strings z, the total number of such pairs is less than 3.3n, which is again negligible 
            compared to the total number of all pairs.
                So there are many pairs satisfying all the conditions.  Let x, y be the first pair. 
            To specify this pair we need to know n and the following three lists:
                  •  the list of all strings of complexity less than 2n,
                  •  the list of all pairs of strings of complexity less than 3n, and
                  •  the list of all pairs of strings  (u,v) with C(u) < l.ln and C(v\u) < l.ln.
                Recall that the complexity of the list of all strings of complexity less than к is
            at most к + 0 (log&)  (the list can be specified by the number к and the size of the 
            list, which is less than 2k and thus can be identified by к bits).
                Therefore, the list of all strings of complexity less than 2n has complexity at 
            most 2n + O(logn).  For the same reasons the complexity of the second list is less 
            than 3n + O(logn).
               A similar argument can be applied to the list of all pairs of strings (u,v) such 
            that C(u) < l.ln and C(v \ u) < l.ln.  The complexity of this list is at most 2.2n + 
            O(logn).  Indeed, we can find this list from n and the number of such pairs, which 
            is less than 22-2n.
               What is the joint  complexity of three lists,  i.e.,  the complexity of the triple 
            made of these three lists?  Is is much less than the sum of their complexities and is 
            bounded by our maximal bounds, i.e., 3n (with accuracy O(logn)).  Indeed, given 
            n, each list can be specified by its size.  Moreover, we only need to know the sum of 
            the sizes.  Indeed, we can generate elements from all three lists in parallel until we 
            obtain the specified total number of elements.  Once we get that many elements, 
           we know all the three lists.  It remains to notice that the sum of any three binary 
            numbers is at most two bits longer than the maximal number.  Therefore the joint 
            complexity of the three lists is at most 3n + O(logn).
               Thus,  the complexity of the pair x, у is at most 3n + O(logn).  On the other 
           hand,  its  complexity is  at  least  3n  by  construction.  Again  by  construction,  the 
           complexity of each of x, у is at least 2n.  As the length of both x, у is 2n + 2, the 
           complexity of each of them is at most 2n + 0(1).  Finally, by construction there is 
           no z with C(z) < l.ln, C(x\z) < l.ln, C{y\z) < l.ln.                         □
               It is clear that the bound can be improved; let us make more precise estimates. 
           Assume that we want to construct strings x and у of complexity 2n (both) with 
           mutual information n, but there should be no string z such that
                             C(z) < a,  C(x\z) < ß,    and  C(y\z)<'y.
           What are the conditions on a, ß, and 7 that make our construction possible?  The 
           list of all pairs u,v such that C(u) < a and C(v\u) < ß has complexity a + ß, so 
           we need the condition a + ß <  3n.  In the same way,  the condition a + 7  <  3n 
           appears.  Finally,  to prove the existence of a pair we need to know that less than 
           24n pairs are prohibited, so we add the condition a + ß + 7 < 4n.  These conditions 
           are sufficient to construct a pair with the required properties.
               Moreover,  we  can  prohibit  simultaneously  all  the  pairs  for  different  triples 
           a, yd, 7  that  satisfy  these  inequalities.  There  are  0(n3)  triples,  so  if we  require 
           the inequalities to be true with an 0 (logn)-margin, we still have pairs that are not 
           prohibited; the complexity overhead needed to merge polynomially many enumer­
           ations is also O(logn).  So we get the following statement:
