                                 4.7.   CONDITIONAL PREFIX COMPLEXITY AND COMPLEXITY OF PAIRS                                                        107
                           Proof.  In one direction the inequality is already known  (see the discussion 
                    above).  One can give also a direct argument:  to get a prefix-free description of a 
                    pair  (x,y),  it  is enough to start with the shortest prefix-free description of x and 
                    then append the prefix-free description of y with conditions x and К(x) (note that 
                    K(x) is just the length of the prefix-free description of x).  After the machine reads 
                    the first part and stops, we know both x (its output) and K(x)  (the length of the 
                    input), so we have all needed information to restore у (in a self-delimiting way).
                          Using semimeasures, we can prove the same inequality as follows.  Consider a 
                    function m! such that
                                                      m'([x,y})=                  ^2            2~km{y\x,k).
                                                                           {k\2~k' <2m(x)}
                    This function is lower semicomputable, and its sum over all x, у is finite (for each 
                    x and к the sum over all у does not exceed 1, then the sum over all к such that 
                    2~k < 2m(x) does not exceed 4m(x), and the sum over x does not exceed 4).  So we 
                    compare m' with the a priori probability and conclude that for к = — [log2 m.(x)J, 
                   we get the term that we want to estimate.
                          Note the important technical trick:  we cannot write just
                                                             m!([x,y]) = m(x)m(y\x,K(x)),
                   since  the semicomputability is  no  longer guaranteed.  To  avoid  the problem,  we 
                    extend the sum over all к ^ K(x).
                          Now let us consider the reversed inequality:
                                                      K(x) + K(y\x,K(x)) ^ K(x, y) + 0(1).
                    Let  us  start  with  a  simple  (but  incorrect!)  proof of a  stronger  (but  incorrect!) 
                   statement
                                                           K(x) + K(y\x) ^ K(x,y) + 0(\).
                   In terms of semimeasures this equality can be rewritten as
                                                                  m(x)m(y\x) ^ em([x,y])
                    (for some £ and for all x,y).  Here m stands for a priori probabilities (both condi­
                   tional and unconditional ones).  Let us rewrite this inequality as
                                                                     m(y\x) ^ £ m{[x,y})
                                                                                            m(x)
                   It is enough to show that the function
                                                                     m'(y\x) = £m([x,y])
                                                                                             m(x)
                   for any fixed x is a semimeasure (for some e); after that we can compare it with the 
                   maximal semimeasure m(y\x) and get the desired result.  We need to show that 
                   the sum of m'(y \x) over у does not exceed 1:
                                                          ^2m'{y\x) =£ T,ym([xM ^ I-
                                                            у                               m(x)
                   Indeed, the function x ^  ^ ym([x,y]) is a semimeasure (its sum over all x equals 
                    Т,х,ут([Х’У}) ^ 1), and therefoie this function is bounded by т(з:)/r foi some £.
                          What is wrong with this argument?  We have not checked that the semimea­
                   sure we constructed is lower semicomputable.  There are two cases where we need to
