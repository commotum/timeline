                                                         7.2.   PAIRS  AND  CONDITIONAL ENTROPY                                                         225
                    where h(e) is the entropy of a random variable with two values and probabilities e 
                    and 1 — e.
                           (Hint:  Let 7 be a random variable with two values;  7 = 0 when ot ф ß and 
                    7 = 1 when a — ß.  Then H(a\ß) < H{7) + H(a|/5,7).  The first term is Д(er), and 
                    the second one can be rewritten as
                                             Pr[7 = 0}H((oi\ß)\j = 0) + Pr[7 = l]H((oi\ß)\j = 1),
                    i.e.,
                                           Pr[a ф ß\H((a\ß)\a ф ß) + Pr[a = ß]H((a\ß)\a = ß),
                    which does not exceed e log a + 0.)
                            229 Assume that H(a\ß,'y) — 0 and I(ß : a) — 0.  Prove that                                                  7) ^ H(a).
                           This problem has the following interpretation.  If a spy wants to send to the 
                    headquarters a secret message a as a plain text ß using a key 7 (that is agreed upon 
                    in advance) and wants the adversary, who does not know 7, to get no information 
                    about a, then the entropy of key 7 cannot be less than entropy of the message a. 
                    This statement is sometimes called the Shannon theorem on perfect cryptosystems.
                            230 Prove that
                                                     2H(a, ß, 7) < H(a, ß) + H(ß, 7) + H (a, 7)
                    for any three random variables a, ß, 7.
                           (Hint:  See the proof of the corresponding statement about Kolmogorov com­
                    plexity, Theorem 26 (p. 48).)
                            231 Prove a similar inequality for n random variables:
                                   {n - l)H{oi\,... ,an) ^ H(a2, ...,£*„) +  ■■■ +  #(£*!,... ,an_i).
                    (The right-hand side contains n terms where one of the variables is omitted.)
                            232 (Shearer inequality  [43])  Prove the following generalization of the pre­
                    ceding inequality.  Let T\,... ,Tk  be arbitrary tuples made of (some of)  the ran­
                    dom variables 07,...,an,  and each variable appears  in exactly r  tuples  (among 
                    Ti,...,Tfc).  Then
                                                    rH(al,a2,. ■. ,an) ^ H(T\) н------\-H(Tk).
                            233  Prove that the inequality of Problem 231 implies the upper bound for the 
                    volume of an n-dimensional body in terms of the volumes of its (n— l)-dimensional 
                    projections onto coordinate hyperplanes (the case n = 3 was mentioned on p.  12): 
                    If V is the volume of the body and Vi,..., Vn are volumes of its projections, then
                                                                    V^ - 1  < Vi • V2                  vn
                           (.Hint:  First consider the discrete version when the body is made of unit cubes 
                    on the grid.  For this a random variable that is uniformly distributed among these 
                    cubes is useful.  An arbitrary case can be treated as the limit of the discrete one.)
                          The  last  inequality  is  a  special  case  of a  general  Loomis-Whitney  inequal­
                    ity [105].
