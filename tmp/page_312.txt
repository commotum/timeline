Number of Preview Characters

more time in both the perceptual and the cognitive processor. What
the total effect will be depends on the critical-path analysis and
hence on the relative size of the motor operation.

(6) The same mechanism of having to deal with units—syllables
and letters, as opposed to words—accounts for effects of restricted
preview. Recall that this is where the experimenter makes available
only K characters to the right of where the keystrokes are occur-
ring. The restriction lets the typist see only fragments of words, and
hence the ability to deal in whole words is lost. This mechanism
seems to account for most of the effect, as Figure 5-20 shows.
Actually, the syllable shows up as an intermediate unit. If the typist
can see a syllable in the preview window, then he or she has direct
access to its letters. At first blush, it may seem odd to obtain a
continuous curve of speed versus preview size, when the mecha-
nism involves only discrete units, the letter, syllable, and word.
However, the statistics of language smoothes out the curve.

And so it goes through the Salthouse 29. Soar gets the other
regularities (that it does obtain) through analyses analogous to
those in John’s original METT model. This model, although impres-
sive, does not explain all the regularities, and for those it does
explain it does not do so as completely as the data permit. We
should expect Soar to provide an improvement on METT, because
it provides the extra mechanisms.
