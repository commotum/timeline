Maxcu 1963

in tabulating Z, there is a precise two-to-one relation
between M, and M41. The initial maximum 1/,=483
is shown as if it had followed a maximum M)=385,
since maxima near 385 are followed by close approaches
to the origin, and then by exceptionally large maxima,

It follows that an investigator, unaware of the nature
of the governing equations, could formulate an empirical
prediction scheme from the “data” pictured in Tigs, 2
and 4, From the value of the most recent maximum of
Z, values at future maxima may be obtained by repeated
applications of Fig. 4. Values of X, Y, and Z between
maxima of Z may be found from Fig. 2, by interpolating
between neighboring curves. Of course, the accuracy of
predictions made by this method is limited by the
exactness of Figs. 2 and 4, and, as we shall see, by the
accuracy with which the initial values of X, Y, and Z
are observed.

Some of the implications of Fig. 4 are revealed by
considering an idealized two-to-one correspondence be-
tween successive members of sequences Mo, Mi, ---,
consisting of numbers between zero and one. These
sequences satisfy the relations

Mii=2M, if M,.<
Maj1 isundefined if Mn=% (35)
Mup=2-2M, if Ma>t.

The correspondence defined by (35) is shown in Fig. 5,
which is an idealization of Fig, 4. It follows from re-
peated applications of (35) that in any particular
sequence,

M = m,42"°M,

(36)

where is an even integer.

Consider first a sequence where M@y=#/2?, where 2 is
odd, In this case 44,-1=3, and the sequence terminates.
These sequences form a denumerable set, and corre-
spond to the trajectories which score direct hits upon the
state of no convection.

Next consider a sequence where Mo=1/2?v, where #
and » are relatively prime odd numbers. Then if &>0,
Morten = t/2, where u, and v are relatively prime and
uw is even. Since for any v the number of proper fractions
u,/v is finite, repetitions must occur, and the sequence
is periodic. These sequences also form a denumerable
set, and correspond to periodic trajectories.

The periodic sequences having a given number of
distinct values, or phases, are readily tabulated. In
particular there are a single one-phase, a single two-
phase, and two three-phase sequences, namely,

2/3, °°,

2/5, 4/5, ---,
2/7, 4/7, 6/7, «+,
2/9, 4/9, 8/9, ++.

The two three-phase sequences differ qualitatively in
that the former possesses two numbers, and the latter
only one number, exceeding 3. Thus the trajectory corre-
sponding to the former makes two circuits about C,
followed by one about C’ (or vice versa). The trajectory
corresponding to the latter makes three circuits about C,
followed by three about C’, so that actually only Z
varies in three phases, while X and F vary in six.
Now consider a sequence where My is not a rational
fraction. In this case (36) shows that Jf,4, cannot equal
