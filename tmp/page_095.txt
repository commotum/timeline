every 0.01 sec. Some other structure holds the temporary data
saved over several tenths of seconds to accomplish the task. In
both cases, some structure must vary. Such momentarily varying
structures are labeled the memory content.

But other process can change the system more slowly. If there is
feedback from the performance, the contents of the memory will
change, but at a slower rate (10 sec). Skill acquisition might go on at
an even slower rate (100 to 1,000 sec), and developmental changes
might occur even more slowly (10° sec). Changes at all these differ-
ent times scales are important. Some long-term changes might sim-
ply be content changes, namely just changes to the storage struc-
tures (0.1 sec). But others might change structures that were fixed
during the performance (1 sec). Some or all of these might be taken
to be architectural changes. Certainly what was fixed throughout
the performance has now become variable. But some long-term
changes, such as knowledge acquisition, may still seem better clas-
sified as memory changes, with only skill acquisition and other
longer-duration changes taken to be architecture changes. This is
all mostly a question of terminology. What is important to under-
stand is that natural systems are changing at all time scales simulta-
neously. Such continuous plasticity does not invalidate the notion
of an architecture as a fixed structure; it just makes the term jixed
relative to the time scale.'*

The important questions about architecture concern what func-
tions are to be provided by the fixed structure. An architecture
provides a boundary that separates structure from content. Behav-
ior is determined by variable content being processed according to
the fixed processing structure, which is the architecture. The fixed
structure represents a communality for a wide array of processing.
Thus, the natural question is, What is embodied in the architecture
and what is moved out into the content?

It is given that an architecture must support a symbol system, as
specified in Figure 2-11. But that takes the specification of the ar-
chitecture only a little way. There are implementation issues as well
as additional functions for the architecture to provide. Most of our
experience with architectures comes out of computer science,

15. The picture is somewhat oversimplified. There are three different durations in-
volved: read time, write time, and residence time. Read time is always relatively short, if
the knowledge is to be useful, Residence time is independent of write time, although
almost always longer. The fixity of the architecture is with respect to residence times.
