                                                     Table 8. Examples of InstructionBench data.
                                 Instruction: Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately
                                 completes the request.
               Dolly             Input: What athlete created the ’beast quake’ for the Seattle Seahawks?
                                 Response:
                                 Output: Marshan Lynch
                                 Input: Imagine you are talking to a child, explain the concept of DNA.
               Alpaca-GPT4       Output: Okaykiddo, so you know how we all have things that make us special and unique? Like how
                                 you have your mom’s eyes and your dad’s hair? Well, that’s because of something called DNA. DNA
                                 is like the directions or the recipe that our bodies follow to make us who we are. It decides things like
                                 the color of our eyes, how tall we’ll grow, and even how our personality is.\n\n Just like you follow
                                 instructions to build a Lego castle, the cells in our body follow the DNA’s instructions to make us who
                                 weare. You might also hear DNA being called our ”genetic code,” because it’s kind of like the secret
                                 language that our bodies use to build us.\n\n And the cool thing about DNA is that it’s passed down
                                 from our parents. So, we get half of our DNA from our mom and half from our dad. That’s why we
                                 can have traits from both of them. But even though we share DNA with our family, while there is
                                 nobodyelse in the world with the exact same DNA as us. We are all unique and special in our own
                                 way!\n\nIsn’t that cool? Do you have any more question about it?
                                 Input: Create a list of five unique travel destinations that are not popular tourist spots. Provide a brief
               InstructionWild   description for each destination, highlighting what sets it apart from other popular travel locations.
                                 Output: Meghalaya, India: Located in the northeast part of India, Meghalaya is known for its
                                 beautiful rivers, ancient caves, and rich cultural heritage. It\u2019s one of the least explored regions
                                 of the country, making it an ideal destination for those looking for an escape from the crowds of
                                 popular tourist spots.\n Atacama Desert, Chile: The driest desert in the world, the Atacama Desert
                                 is an other-worldly landscape of stunning terrain and amazing geological formations. It\u2019s
                                 home to some of the clearest skies on the planet and offers incredible stargazing opportunities.\n
                                 Antarctica: For the adventurous traveler, Antarctica is a wild, unforgiving landscape like no other.
                                 It\u2019shometobreathtaking glaciers, unspoiled coastlines, and an abundance of wildlife. With
                                 few visitors, it\u2019s a paradise for those who want to explore the continent\u2019s remote
                                 beauty.\n Georgia: Located between Europe and Asia, Georgia is a little-known country full of
                                 culture, history, and stunning landscapes. From the city of Tbilisi to the mountains of Svaneti,
                                 there are endless opportunities for exploration and discovery.\n Australian Outback: Few tourists
                                 venture to the remote stretches of the Australian Outback, but it\u2019s well worth the effort. Here,
                                 you\u2019llfind miles of unspoiled nature, rooted in Indigenous history and culture, and the chance
                                 to experience a whole different side of the continent.
              GSM8K:GSM8K9isahigh-qualitydatasetoflinguistically diverse elementary school math word problems, constructed
              byOpenAI.Itcontains a total of 8.5k samples. The dataset’s unique feature lies in its human-crafted problems, avoiding
              templated language, and providing natural language solutions instead of purely mathematical expressions. This design
              ensures a closer alignment with real-world problem-solving scenarios. The primary task type is multi-step mathematical
              reasoning, which effectively diagnoses deficiencies in a model’s reasoning capabilities. Consistent with common pratice, we
              apply a zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompt to each sample, guiding the model to think step by step. For evaluation,

              reasoning through a question-guided approach. It diversifies mathematical problems by rephrasing and restructuring them
              from multiple perspectives, offering a robust and challenging benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning abilities.
              Thedataset focuses on QA tasks and spans a broad spectrum of mathematical problem complexities. Similar to GSM8k, we
              apply a zero-shot CoT prompt to each sample to guide the model in logical reasoning. For evaluation purposes, we randomly
              select 5k samples from the training set.
