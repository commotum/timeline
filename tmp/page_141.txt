A second indicator comes from communication times in the
brain. The speeds of pulse transmission in the central nervous sys-
tem are of the order of a meter per second, at the low end of the
distributions shown in Figure 3-4, and the nerves are small in diam-
eter and unmyelinated. Speeds go below a meter a second. Ex-
pressing this speed equivalently as ~~1 mm/ms, it is easy to see
what it implies for neural circuitry. Within the mm? local circuits,
the flow of pulses and the flow of graded potentials are all in the
same temporal world (~~1 ms), which is consonant with the com-
plex computational characteristics attributed to local circuits. The
distance between local circuits is ~~1 cm (~~10 mm) and the
time to communicate will therefore be ~~10 ms. Thus, time con-
stants for anything involving more than a single local circuit will be
~~10 ms.

The third consideration begins with the fundamental generaliza-
tion that neurons are statistical devices. The neuron is a statistical
engine in which nothing occurs with precise timing. For instance,
there has been much investigation into how information is encoded
in the nervous system. All the encodings are forms of pulse-rate
encodings. Stimulus intensity of sound, light, or pressure is en-
coded as the expected number of pulses per second. There is evi-
dence for other sorts of codes, such as the interpulse interval or the
variance of the pulse rates, but they are all statistics on the pulse
Sequences as a stochastic process. A major consequence is that
precision, reliability, or stability in such codes requires at least one
level of integration. Measurement has to take a sample of pulses. It
may not be necessary to take large samples—-sophisticated statisti-
cal operations might get by with small samples. But the latter still
require ~~10 pulses. With ~~1 ms separation between pulses, ata
minimum, any statistical integration will move up to the ~~10 ms
region. Again we arrive at the proposition that neural circuits are
~~10 ms devices at a minimum.®

All of these considerations point in the same direction. An en-
gineer would see the situation as indicating that the entire system is
in balance (as opposed to it being a set of separate arguments from
which you can reject one argument and buy another). He'd see a
system that appeared to be cleverly engineered in transmission

8. Spatial averaging exists as well as temporal averaging, and it can diminish the need
for temporal integration.
