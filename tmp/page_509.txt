IN] 1. Every agent has a drive to evaluate its opinions and abilities

{M] 2. If the agent can’t evaluate its opinions and abilities objectively,
than it compares them against the apinions and abilities of
others

(M] 3. Comparing against others decreases as the difference with
others increases

[N] 4. Every agent has a drive to improve abilities, but not opinions

(N] 5. Improving abilities is objectively more difficult than improving
opinions

[E] 6. Ceasing to compare with another is accompanied by hostility
and derogation if continued comparison implies unpleasant
consequences

(M]_ 7. The more important a group for comparison of an opinion or
ability, the more pressure there is toward uniformity on that
opinion or ability

[M] 8. A large divergence of opinion or ability with others that differ
strongly on relevant attributes leads to a narrowing of the
range within which comparison will occur

{M] 9. The pressure toward uniformity of opinion or ability is stronger
for those close to the mode of opinion or ability than for those
more distant

rational behavior. Soar evaluates all the time. Soar, of course, does
it under the impress of a goal to be attained, whereas SCT ascribes
the tendency to evaluate to a basic drive. But a review of the way
Festinger uses the theory shows that this is a distinction without
much difference—the effect of axiom 1 is to permit the analyst to
posit an evaluation anywhere he finds it expedient. Thus, we clas-
sify axiom 1 as [N].

Axiom 2 specifies that if objective evaluation is not possible, then
the agent compares against what others do. This is essentially a
principle of cognitive operation in a multiagent situation. If evalua-
tion is necessary, then others’ evaluations are a source of relevant
knowledge. Thus, it is classified as [M]. There is no specific social
content involved.

Each of the axioms can be classified in this way. The interesting
result is that only one, axiom 6, is other than [N] or [M]. This is the
assumption that hostility and derogation will accompany the act of
ceasing to compare. If an agent has been using someone as the basis
