stream, the study of syllogistic reasoning has a long active history
(Evans, 1982; Falmagne, 1975; Johnson-Laird, 1983; Revlin &
Mayer, 1978; Woodworth & Sells, 1935). The reason for the activity
is not far to seek. It is the tension in Western civilization between
reason and passion—between the mind and the heart. Can people
be rational and logical? Or are they slaves to their passions? A
necessary condition for the ascendancy of reason would seem to be
that people be able to think straight. What could be a greater indi-
cator of straight thinking than making logical inferences? Syilo-
gisms, the epitome of logical reasoning from Aristotle onward, were
a natural focus for anyone investigating the question. Although they
seem somewhat arcane to us now, their recession into the back-
ground has occurred only with the rise of modern symbolic logic.
If the most elementary and certain forms of reasoning (syllo-
gisms) are in fact difficult, then (it was often suggested) perhaps
people are not logical at all, are not rational, or have severe limits
on their reasoning powers. The notion arose that perhaps humans
follow some sort of psychologic—that their reasoning is not faulty
but rather follows laws of its own. Most such discussions were
carried on in public and philosophical forums, but even so they
have fueled a continual stream of experimental psychological work.
For us, as well, that they are difficult makes syllogisms inter-
esting (though it is only one reason, as we shall see). The theory of
cognition sees humans as gradually approximating the knowledge
level. At the knowledge level it would seem (would it not?) that
syllogisms would be performable. There could be difficulties, of
course, in understanding the language—about the meaning of Ali
chipmunks are conserved or Some butterflies are not gardeners or
even the instructions, What follows necessarily? But having gotten
over that hump, we should have clear sailing ahead. Difficulty could
also be expected if time was short-time scale is always critical.
But with unlimited time, and tasks that take only some few seconds
when successful, difficulty should not be a factor. Thus, when sub-
stantial difficulties emerge and persist, as they do for syllogisms,
then the task offers a useful case in probing how humans approach
and approximate the intendedly rational level. Possibly we can dis-
cover other sorts of limits on rationality besides temporal ones.
In addition to the focus on untoward difficulty, which gives the
task its scientific appeal, we also want to look at what regularities
humans exhibit in syllogistic reasoning. In Chapter 5, I made a
