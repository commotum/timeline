P and once for G. It need not take an exceptionally long time—~50
Operators in the present case—but it does impart a measure of
higher-order regularity to behavior.

The presentation of Soar’s behavior on this task has been highly
abstract, but the actual analysis has not been abstract at all. All the
details, down to the productions, are going on under the floor of
Figure 8-7. Thus, the situation here differs from the technique
introduced for immediate-response behavior, where we carried
through the entire analysis at an abstract functional level. Here, no
such abstract analytical technique is yet possible. Only by working
with a full simulation can one have any confidence of what will
happen. This may not always be the case, of course. As patterns
develop it could become clear what evokes them and what their
yield will be, and a way to abstract away from them might be found.

8.2.4. Reflections on Soar and Development
Let us reflect upon what has been attained in this analysis of devel-
opment. Most important, Soar has demonstrated an actual transi-
tion mechanism. It actually makes the transition at two points, from
the level of rule | to that of rule 2, and from the level of rule 2 to that
of rule 3. This transition mechanism has several important charac-
teristics. It does it all by chunking, so it is certainly an example of
regular learning—of short-term learning, when viewed on the time
scale of development. It learns both new encodings and new com-
parisons. The investigation was somewhat truncated with respect
to both encoding and comparison, but the processes were there and
they operated to produce new processes of the appropriate type.
Development is driven by feedback from an external source (here
the experimenter) in response to bad predictions. Soar recovers
from its errors by creating the ability to discriminate prior to evok-
ing the old errors again. It does this by means of revision problem
spaces. It is noteworthy that this solution has been achieved with-
out modification of the Soar architecture. Just as with data chunk-
ing, we have been led to interesting mechanisms simply by listening
to the existing architecture. The solution, as sketched out in Fig-
ures 8-7 and 8-8, seems complex, although this is partly in the eye of
the beholder, because we're granted a bird’s-eye view. From the
system's viewpoint, it is simply responding to impasses with local
considerations. For instance, when Soar is in a problem space,
trying to produce a predict-operator and failing to have sufficient
