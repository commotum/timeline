match, as we termed it when discussing the Sternberg phenomena
in Chapter 5.

It follows that episodic, semantic, and procedural knowledge
must all be encoded in this same memory. Uniformity at this basic
memory level has many consequences. However, there are some
consequences it does not have. It does not imply a single encoding
for ail knowledge. A uniform level of encoding at one level can be
used to create multiple codes at higher levels. This process is trans-
parent with computers, which at one level have a uniform represen-
tation of bit vectors and use that coding to produce at higher levels
an indefinitely diverse set of representations—numbers, arrays,
lists, attribute-value systems—and above these yet other diverse
application systems with their own domain-dependent representa-
tions, ad infinitum.

And for the lower level of the neural-circuit implementation, uni-
formity at the memory level does not imply the same structure and
mechanisms, for example, realization as a fixed uniform neural cir-
cuit. One reason we do not assume similar structures at the two
levels is that a given function can be realized by many alternative
mechanisms—this rule certainly holds for architectures (Figure
2-14)—but there are more specific reasons. The productions of a
production system do not interact directly but only via the elements
they deposit in working memory. A production system might better
be called a production collection. This is especially true for Soar,
where conflict resolution, which does make productions interact, is
entirely removed.

This point is important, because there is a tendency simply to
believe that the functional homogeneity of production systems con-
flicts with the evidence of heterogeneity of neural organs and their
dedication to special computational functions (Geschwind, 1981).
Figure 6-2 shows how an apparently homogeneous production sys-
tem can actually be composed of several heterogeneous production
systems. The figure is looking down on working memory, broken
up into a set of regions, each region realized in separate parts of the
nervous system. Each region has its own production system, with
its own matching rules, each takes somewhat different times to
execute, and so on. Several things must hold for this sort of separa-
tion to work. Some production systems must function as communi-
cation devices, transmitting working-memory elements from one
region to elements in another, possibly with transduction (remap-
