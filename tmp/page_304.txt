and-test or an assembly/activation Process was being performed,
but only on the exhaustiveness of the decision cycle. The qualita-
tive level provides yet another example, in addition to analysis by
functional operations, of reasoning with Soar as a theory of unified
cognition, without requiring us to carry out a detailed simulation,
It helps debunk the stereotype that Programmed information-
processing models always require detailed simulations.

The Sternberg task provides a good Opportunity for exploring
analysis at the detailed level of a fully specified Soar system, What
would happen if we tried to specify a fully detailed modei—that is,
specify the productions—for the item-recognition task? The ex-
ample will show why it is not always profitable to work at this fine-
grained level.

The top of Figure 5-16 shows the memory elements that would be
built by the schematic procedure set up in the qualitative analysis.
There is a state s{, with an attribute items, which has four values,
dl,..., 44. This is the standard Soar encoding, where an attribute
can have multiple values. Each value represents a particular item.
Item d1 has the vaiue 3, d2 the value 6, and so on down the list. The
probe is represented as attribute probe; it is item 45, which has
value 6. The values of d2 and d5 are actually the same, but of course
Soar doesn't know it.

Several productions are written in the figure below the working-
memory data structure. The first production (item-test-1) does the
essential task of declaring success if the probe matches a target.
This occurs as part of the comprehend operator. It is just the posi-
tive response; it takes another production to handle the negative
tesponse. The first condition picks up an item <x1> and the probe
<x2>. Among other things, this first condition will keep this pro-
duction from firing unless both target and probe have arrived. The
second and third condition pick up the element of the target and
probe, respectively, but only if they have the same value. This step
is enforced by using the same variable <v> for both values. Thus,
these two condition elements, by having the same value, are apply-
ing an equality test constraint during the course of the match to
select a satisfied production. If there isa matching target and probe,
this production will find it and fire, declaring success.

How long it takes such a production to execute depends on the
assumptions about the details of the match. Figure 5-3 outlined
various options, indicated on the figure above. (Al) If we assume
the standard Ops5 computational model that the time fora produc-
