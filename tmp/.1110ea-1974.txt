                           a digit preload,                 with the size of the decrement                                being a function of                                                           the memory load relatively constant throughout the list and so avoid

The first is to conclude that an STM preload does not interfere                                                                                                        quences.

The three-digit                            concurrent             load condition                was similar

To accept this hypothesis would require                                                                                                           except that the three-digit                            sequences            were presented                  for only two

                            preload items at the beginning of the list, and by the end of the list                                                                                                      followed, respectively,                      by gaps of two and four seconds. In this con-

                            items when recall was delayed (see Fig. 3). This suggests that the                                                                                                          held in memory simultaneously.
