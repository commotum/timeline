simple but real case, we have produced the flowchart.

7.3.2. Soar on Acquiring a Task

The above demonstration shows how the flowchart comes from the
problem space, but it leaves unanswered the next question. Where
does the problem space come from? Let's step back and consider
the larger experimental situation (Figure 7-16). The experiment oc-
curs when the warning light turns on, a display shows up, the per-
son reads the sentence, examines the picture, and presses the but-
ton, That could happen only if the person had some knowledge,
which we can call prior trial-specific instructions: Read the sen-
tence, then examine the picture, press the true-button if the sen-
tence is true of the picture, press the false-button if the sentence is
false of the picture, then the task is done. By itself, of course, that
knowledge isn’t enough to do the task. That requires in turn some
other knowledge, which we can call prior general instructions: At
some moment the light will come on, after the light comes on a
display will occur, the left side of the display shows a sentence, and
