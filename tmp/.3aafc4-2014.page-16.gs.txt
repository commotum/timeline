        Figure 7: Graphs of automaton size versus complexity maximum value. Linear curve ﬁts are shown, with
        r2 values of 0.9798 for the interacting automaton and 0.9729 for the non-interacting automaton.
        Figure 8: Graphs of automaton size versus time to complexity maximum. Quadratic curve ﬁts are shown,
        with r2 values of 0.9878 for the interacting automaton and 0.9927 for the non-interacting automaton.
        Figure 9: A coarse-grained array consisting of a smooth gradient from 0 to 1 is shown at left. At right is
        the same array after a small amount of simulated noise has been added and the values have been thresholded.
