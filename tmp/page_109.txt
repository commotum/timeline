take? For tasks that are relatively difficult, there is an answer—the
agent will engage in search.

Search is fundamental for intelligent behavior. It is not just an-
other method or cognitive mechanism, but a fundamental process.
If there is anything that AI has contributed to our understanding of
intelligence, it is discovering that search is not just one method
among many that might be used to attain ends but is the most
fundamental method of all.” The discussions of psychological pro-
cesses involved in thinking, reasoning, and intelligence before the
advent of AI in the mid-1950s show no particular emphasis on

* search (Johnson, 1955; Vinacke, 1952).

Two considerations lie behind the special role of search. One can
be called the existential predicament of intelligent systems. When
attempting to act, an intelligent system is uncertain. Indeed, that is
of the essence of having a problem—it is not known what to do
next. A system facing a problem exists in historical time. Its exis-
tential situation is that it must behave now but it is uncertain what
to do. Thinking, here, is behaving—to think of one thing is not to
think of other things. Suppose the system does not behave~does
not think—then a little bit of the immediate future passes by and the
same situation remains. It knows nothing further (it has not given
any thought to the matter, so to speak), and it has just lost that bit
of time. Thus, it is forced to act, even though, a fortiori, it is un-
certain.

By itself this existential predicament generates search, indeed
combinatorial search. In an uncertain situation, to act—to think the
next thought—means to be wrong occasionally. (What else could
uncertainty mean?) If the act is wrong, then recovery is neces-
sary—recovery and trying again. But this situation cascades. A
wrong act is taken while the system is still on a wrong path, and
from that point of error still another wrong path is taken. This is
exactly the pattern of behavior of combinatorial search.

Search need not exhibit the pattern of classical (chronological)
backtracking. The system could return to some prior anchor point,
or engage in some sort of dependency-directed backtracking, or
attempt to repair the results of erroneous actions. Ail of these varia-

tal. They are what allows contact between stored memory structure and temporarily
available task structure, as in production systems,
