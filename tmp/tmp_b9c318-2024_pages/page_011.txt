               TheKITTIdatasetis extensively utilized for assessing 3D object detection and consists of 7,481 training samples and 7,518 testing samples.

               split of 3769 samples. The detection task level is categorized as easy, moderate, and hard based on object size, occlusion, and truncation
               status. All models are trained exclusively for training split, and their performance is evaluated on the validation split and test set. We adopt
               the evaluation metrics by the KITTI dataset, which include the mean average precision with 11 recall positions (AP|R11), the mean average
               precision with 40 recall positions (AP|R40) and the average orientation similarity (AOS) with 40 recall positions. AP|R11, AP|R40, and AOS
               are denoted as follows:
