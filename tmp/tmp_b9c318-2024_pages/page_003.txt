                                                                                                                                                       25

                 like center-spreading attention module to determine the attention range, which searches sequentially outwards for voxels involved in the
                 attention computation with the query voxel as the center, on the other hand, we establish an voxel hash table for storing non-empty voxels
                 to expedite the voxel search process in self-attention computations.
                    Secondly, in order to make the feature information obtained by the detection head more reliable, the PST-FPN is designed to obtain the
                 weights of different features. Different from the traditional feature pyramid net (FPN), PST-FPN enhances the representation of important
                 features by introducing spatial and channel attention mechanisms with residual networks.
                    Finally, unlike the anchor-base methods, using points to represent objects is advantageous for predicting the posture of cars during
                 turning maneuvers. At the same time, if the object is represented by using a center-point, this will greatly facilitate the execution of subse-

                    The remaining structure of this article is arranged as follows: Section 2 provides an elaboration on related work concerning 3D object
                 detection using LiDAR. Then, Section 3 offers a detailed explanation of the proposed VSAC. This is followed by Section 4, where detailed
                 experiments and results are presented. Finally, a concise conclusion of the paper is drawn in Section 5.
