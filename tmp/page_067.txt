2.3. Representation

Knowledge abstracts from representation, yet knowledge must be
represented in some fashion in order to be used, told, or thought.
This may seem like a special philosophical statement, justified by
some particular argument. But it is not. It is simply the proposi-
tion that knowledge-level systems are simultaneously describable
at lower levels and that systems that exist in the physical world
have physical descriptions. Thus, to use Figure 2-3 as a guide, a
knowledge-level system that exists in the physical world also can be
described as a programmed system, a register-transfer system, a
logic system, an electrical circuit, and an electronic device. Of
course, the hierarchy of that figure is not necessarily the only
hierarchy that can have knowledge systems at the top. The figure
exhibits one hierarchy that we know of that does include knowledge
systems. Other hierarchies might well exist. Indeed, in the case of
humans, who are describable as knowledge-level systems better
than any of the computer systems we have around, the hierarchy
must be quite different as it makes its way down to the biological
substrate. Establishing the existence of alternative hierarchies that
support a knowledge level is a scientific task or an engineering task,
depending on whether we discover the hierarchy by the analysis of
existing systems or invent it by the design and construction of
hitherto nonexisting systems.

Let us turn, then, to the nature of representation, which is an-
other fundamental concept in cognitive science. Let us start by
being specific. A standard way of Tepresenting knowledge is with a
logic. Figure 2-5 provides such a tepresentation for the blocks
world. The representation consists of the expressions in the figure.
There is a predicate, block, that can be used to assert that A isa
block, B is a block, C is a block, and the table Tis not a block.
Another predicate, on, can be used to assert that B is on the table T,
A is on B, and C is on T. Another predicate, clear, is defined in
terms of block and on. « is clear if and only if x is a block and, if y is
any block, then it is not on x. From this information it can be
inferred that block B is not clear. Thus if expressions t-3 in Figure
2-5 represent what X knows, then X also knows that B is not clear.
And if we couple this with knowledge of X's goal, Y's request, and
Xs ability to communicate, then we can predict that X will tell Y
that B is not clear. :
