not destroy or replace the old, but monotonically adds to it. Ele-
ments must ultimately disappear from working memory, of course.
This happens automatically when they become inaccessible be-
cause of the dynamics of problem solving (described below after the
decision apparatus is introduced).

The second special property of Soar productions is that there is
no conflict resolution. In general, given a set of elements in working
memory, there can be no guarantee that only a single production
will match with only a single instantiation. It is possible (and usu-
ally happens) that multiple productions with multiple instantiations
occur. OpsS calls this the conflict set. Ops5, and most other produc-
tion systems, apply a fixed set of rules to resolve the conflict and to
specify a single production instantiation to execute. Soar does no
conflict resolution and executes all satisfied instantiations. Thus,
the production system is an entirely parallel, uncontrolled sys-
tem. In this respect, as well as that it only adds working-memory
elements, the Soar production system operates like a content-
addressed memory.

4.1.3. Objects with Attributes and Values for the
Representational Medium
As Figure 4-4 shows, Soar has a very elementary representation of
objects with collections of attributes and values. Both the attributes
and values may be other objects, so that arbitrary attribute-value
structures can occur. The grain size of the representation is the
value of an attribute of an object. This is the unit that is indepen-
dently readable and writable by a production. Conditions, actions,
and working-memory elements are object-attribute-value triples.
Consequently, an object is a collection of such elements. This is a
medium that admits combinatoria! variety and is easy to manipu-
late, as called for in Chapter 2. It is used for all representations.
Objects are defined by their set of attributes and values, so that
two objects with the same attributes and values are taken to be the
same. The identifiers (g3, p14, and the like) are simply temporary
labels that serve to identify when a production is referring to the
same object. Thus, the identifiers are created as arbitrary symbols
by the actions of the productions, as occurred in Figure 4-4 when
082 was created to identify the new operator named comprehend.
The representation bears some affinity to object-oriented repre-
sentations and frame (or schema) representations (Minsky, 1975),
