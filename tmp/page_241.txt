GPS’s basic structure precluded it from being appropriately dis-
tractible.'® This seemed to Reitman a fatal flaw, and he went on to
develop the Argus system, whose central point was to exhibit ap-
propriate distractibility. Soar’s decision cycle is indeed structured
so that distraction can occur, although it is not so structured in
order to be distractible. There is no constraint on what productions
fire, except the content of the existing working memory. Any deci-
sion can be made at any time—there is no top-down mode setting or
conditioning of what decision is to be made at a given point (such as
now select a state, now select an operator, or now return the result),
Indeed, Soar is a distractible system in exactly the sense that Reit-
man was after, although it attains this characteristic without the
massive architectural alterations that Reitman put into Argus (to
produce a system that would be seen today as somewhat connec-
tionist in spirit). I bring up this example only to point out that one
sufficiently glaring failure of a global qualitative characteristic can
doom a theory of human behavior, Thus, it is worth examining a list
of global characteristics before we start applying the theory to de-
tails.

Proceeding now from the top item (1), Soar has all of those char-
acteristics that were developed in Chapters 2 and 3 and that have
just been linked to Soar by the mapping in Figure 4-23. Soar has
symbols, both automatic and controlled behavior, a basic recogni-
tional mode of operation, a fast-read slow-write long-term memory,
and a continual shift to recognition with experience. We argued for
all of these as features of human cognition, and Soar exhibits them
as well. More globally, with the given mapping, Soar has the same
temporal bands and levels that stratify the different cognitive
worlds in humans. We know nothing about Soar above the in-
tendedly rational band, but that is about as high as our analysis of
human behavior goes in any event.

{2) Soar behaves intelligently. In simple cases its behavior can be
predicted just by what it knows and wants. However, it is not
completely rational and only approximates a knowledge-level
system.

(3) Soar is goal oriented, but not just because it has learned goals

t6. The lack of distractibility was characteristic of essentially all Al programs of that
era, but GPS was also a system that embodied a psychological theory. so it was a naturat
focus for this criticism,
