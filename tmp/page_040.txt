created. This happens automatically by the composition (or chain-
ing) of the productions that execute in sequence. The new produc-
tion thus moves directly from the initial situation to the final result.
Third, productions have an associated strength, which determines
the likelihood that they will fire, given that their conditions are
satisfied. These strengths increase with use and decrease with dis-
use, so there is a continuous tuning effect. These last two learning
mechanisms provide a theory of cognitive skill acquisition.

Act* is specified as a set of rules about its structure and the ways
actions occur, plus a set of equations for the flow of activation and
the fluctuations in production strength. The theory is too com-
plicated for any but the simplest explicit calculations, but some
simulations have been run to show the effect of the whole model;
and there is a production system called Grapes (Sauers & Farrell,
1982) that embodies the basic production action and automatic cre-
ation mechanisms.

The scope of Act* is very large. At the immediate-response level
it covers a lot of regularities about priming, fact retrieval, and mem-
ory effects; there is even an explanation of how mental rotation
would go (Shepard & Metzler, 1971). At the cognitive-skill level it
