is exactly right. The case is isomorphic to one of the earliest exam-
ples of the use of heuristics, namely, how to open a combination
safe if a slight click can be heard as each tumbler falls into place
(Newell, Shaw, & Simon, 1958).

Let us examine this scheme in some detail (Rosenbloom, Laird,
& Newell, 1988b). This will take us into the trenches, but the excur-
sion will provide some appreciation of the details of Soar, a glimpse
of an interesting technical problem, and an example of how the
architecture tells us new things. The full solution will take three
steps. First, we must build the recognition of the result (GID).
Second, we must build a basic generator of what has been learned.
