certainly realms that can be labeled social, historical, and evolu-
tionary, and quite different things happen at different time scales.
However, in order for systems levels to exist, in the sense we've
been using them, they must be relatively strong. If the level has to
be decomposed to lower levels to have any ability to explain and
predict its behavior, then there may be little sense in treating it as a
system level at all. Certainly, the evidence is not convincing that
these higher levels are strong enough levels. Despite a long tradi-
tion of seeking laws of social or cultural dynamics (White, 1949),
the current state of sociology does not give much hope of real social
dynamics (Fiske & Shweder, 1986)—regularities, yes; an occa-
sional inevitability, again possible; but societal-level information as
a sufficient predictor of social change, hardly ever. At the historical
level the case seems even more persuasive that strong levels do not
exist. Although there has been much talk and writing about histor-
ical determinism, there is little to show for it and current develop-
ments in historical scholarship have moved off in contrasting direc-
tions, such as negotiated meaning (Toews, 1987).

One reason often given for this situation of apparent weak sys-
temicity is that we humans are sitting within a level, looking up-
ward, so to speak, at the social or historical system. We are the
components of the higher level and so we naturally see our own
dynamics and do not see the inevitable regularity of the higher
level. I suspect that the real issue is not just that we are components
but that we are intelligent components. Thus, we are not bound by
local context, either in space or time. There are no regularities that
hold at higher levels because they can always be defeated by ac-
tions at a tevel that has intelligence. None of the levels below us are
intelligent—are at the intendedly rational level—so this problem of
weak levels does not occur for us as systems. We are just below the
first tevel that loses cohesion.

This hypothesis can be tested, at least a little. Evolution has
always had a special problem with prediction. What path evolution
will take is not predictable. The difficulty is rather well understood
and it reflects the same issues as our arguments about the intelli-
gence of the components. The act of adaptation depends upon the
intimate details of the situation in which organisms find themselves.
There isn’t any way to express those details at a higher level,
namely at the evolutionary level itself. To know what happens in
