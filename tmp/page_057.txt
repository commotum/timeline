other yet something entirely different. When you come back to the _

same situation you may have a different response function. You
climb into the car and something happened differently and you
can’t remember where the key is and now you do something differ-
ent. The world is divided up into microepics, which are sufficiently
distinct and independent so that the control system (that is, the
mind) produces different response functions, one after the other,

It is certainly possible to step back and treat the mind as one big
monster response function; that is, treat the mind as a single func-
tion from the total environment over the total past of the organism
to future actions (under the constraint that output at a given time
never depends on future input), Describing behavior as multiple
response functions implies some sort of decomposition within the
organism. In effect the organism treats the environment as different
enough from time to time, so that the aspects that enter into the
function (that the behavior is made a function of) have little in
common. Thus it is possible to describe the organism as using sepa-
rate functions, one for each situation. This phrase, response func-
tion, will occur over and over again throughout the book, so re-
member it,

2.2. Knowledge Systems

How then should we describe systems? How should we describe
their response functions? To speak of mind as a controller suggests
