One might be tempted to object that X knows not(clear B) di-
rectly from observation, not indirectly via some inference. But this
confuses the knowledge that ¥ has with the representation that X
has of that knowledge. Certainly, X has some representation of this
knowledge. But we do not know that it is the logic representation of
Figure 2-5. In fact, if X is a person and you are a psychologist,
you'll bet that it isn’t. All we assert is that this logic representation
tells us the knowledge that X has. Nothing is said about the form of
that representation, certainly not that the individual expressions in
Figure 2-5 correspond to anything particular in X’s representation.

It is important to be clear that a logic is fust a way of representing
knowledge. It is not the knowledge itself. To see this, let K(i) be the
knowledge represented by expression | in the figure. Thus, by writ-
ing down expressions 1, 2, and 3 as the knowledge that X has, we
certainly mean that X has knowledge K(1) and K(2) and K(3). One
might think that it makes no difference whether we talk about the
expressions or the knowledge—they are in one-to-one correspon-
dence. But that is not the only knowledge X has. X also has K(4).
K(4) certainly does not correspond to any expression that we origi-
nally wrote down (namely, 1, 2, and 3). X has K(4) because expres-
sion 4 can be inferred from expressions 1, 2, and 3 (and the rules of
the logic).

The general situation for logic can be stated easily. If X has the
knowledge represented by a Conjunction of expressions K(1, 2,
...+,M), and expression N follows from 1,2,..., M, then X has
the K(N), the knowledge of expression N. Since, in general, there
are an unlimited number of expressions that follow from a conjunc-
tion of expressions, X’s knowledge is correspondingly unlimited. It
certainly cannot be written down in its entirety. So there is no way
in which one can identify the knowledge of X with the representa-
tion of that knowledge. Instead, what a logic lets us do is Tepresent
the knowledge of X as a finite set of expressions plus a process (the
