templating. It is only remotely controlled by his being in a psycho-
logical laboratory—perhaps an aura of slight extra pressure or a
feeling of seif-exposure. But these feelings and considerations only
float around the periphery of a situation where, second after sec-
ond, he must think about these letters and these digits to solve the
puzzle. There is no way that knowledge of the outer context can be
brought to bear to affect most of the decisions.

7.4.1. Soar on Cryptarithmetic

Soar simulates two segments of the protocol, each about 100 sec-
onds long, as marked in Figure 7-2. The behavior in the initial
segment is fairly straightforward, the second quite complex. Our
initial objective is to get Soar to provide a detailed simulation—in
other words, a description—of the search that $3 carries out in the
problem space. Thus, the simulation assumes the lower-level be-
havior of the system, that is, the operators of the basic space.
Important questions may be asked about how these operators are
carried out, especially the more complex ones, but the strategy of
investigation here is to divide and conquer. The initial step is to
assume the operators and to investigate the search control that
determines the problem behavior graph of Figure 7-2. The imple-
mentation of this strategy involves an interesting style of simula-
tion, Whenever Soar implements an operator, it comes out to an
oracle (the investigator or an internal table), states the inputs and
the situation, and requests the outputs. The oracle provides this
information from the actual experimental data, thus assuring that
the simulated operator at that point delivers exactly what the per-
son did at the corresponding point in the protocol. The question
being asked is what the system will do if the operators deliver
exactly what the person's operators deliver, or what is the role of
search-control knowledge?

Figure 7-3 shows the operators in the space. The four at the top
are the ones that obtain new knowledge. The first one, PC, pro-
cesses a column of the display and derives new knowledge from
arithmetic knowledge and what is known about the letters and car-
ries in a column. The second one, AV, assigns a digit to a letter.
That is, it posits an assignment. This is not new knowledge, in the
sense that it is derived from other data, but it produces a situation in
which the person acts henceforth as if that assignment were cor-
rect—and does so until some evidence arises that invalidates the
