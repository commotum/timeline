Immediate Behavior

The preparations are complete. Our candidate unified theory of
cognition, Soar, has been described in detail, along with how it is to
be mapped onto human cognition. In this chapter we begin the
consideration of Soar in specific domains of human behavior.

As we start to take Soar seriously, I want to reiterate a point
made in Chapter 1. This book argues for unified theories of cogni-
tion—the plural, not the singular. ] am not trying to make the case
that Soar is the only or even the prime candidate in all the land. I
believe it is an interesting candidate and hope that you will find it
interesting too. It is certainly the candidate that I personally wish to
work on. However, the central claim in the book is that it is possi-
ble now to have theories that apply from the level of immediate
behavior to the level of problem solving and learning. I am much
more concerned with figuring out how a theory could put it all
together, and what could be the plausible yield from doing so, than I
am for arguing that a particular candidate (to wit, Soar) is the best
or even the favored choice. This focus also lets me avoid the task of
making continual cross-assessments with other possible candidates
and defending the preferred status of one theory. The task of laying
out a unified theory of cognition is sufficiently demanding that such
an additional burden would be a genuine distraction. I am not at-
tempting to avoid comparison of Soar with competitive theories. As
Soar begins to be a genuine candidate, as opposed to being an
exemplar, then it will be both necessary and appropriate to make
comparisons.

This chapter focuses on immediate behavior, responses that must
be made to some stimulus within very approximately one second
(that is, roughly from ~300 ms to ~3 sec). There are good reasons
for taking up this arena first, other than just that a unified theory of
