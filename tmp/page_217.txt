Figure 4-18. Performance and learning by R1-Soar {adapted from Laird,
Newell, & Rosenbloom, 1987).

Figure 4-18 shows the behavior of R1-Soar on a small configu-
ration task. Consider the No-learning column. The base system is
the one without any heuristic search control at all, just the basic
definition of the task in terms of spaces with their operators, plus
the evaluation functions. Soar obtains the configuration in 1,731
decision cycles, essentially by hill-climbing search with some
backup. Analysis of this performance (by humans) leads to propos-
ing two productions of search-control knowledge, which can then
be added to create the partial system. With these two additional
productions, R1-Soar can attain the configuration in only 243 deci-
sion cycles (attaining the identical final configuration). Adding 8
more search-control productions gives R!-Soar exactly the same
knowledge as RI, to create the full system. We were working from
the actual set of Rl productions, so the characterization of having
“exactly the same knowledge as RI” is reasonably grounded. At
this point, R1-Soar can attain the same configuration in 150 decision
cycles (bottom left number). It moves directly from the order to the
confirmation without search, much as RI does. The factor of ~10
from 1,731 decision cycles to 150 gives an indication of the value of
the search-control knowledge embodied in RI,

The No-learning column demonstrates three things. First, it
shows that Soar can work on modest-size tasks. Vax configuration
is not a huge task, but it is a real task, '2 Second, it shows that Soar

(2. This run is on a small task and with the initial version of R1-Soar, which covered
only ~{5 percent of RI. The second version covered ~25 percent and was run ona batch
of 15 normal-size tasks; see Laird, Newell, and Rosenbloom (1987) for a table of the data.
