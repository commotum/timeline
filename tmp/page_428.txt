Use P-E-A-C
Perception and encoding delivers words serially
A comprehension operator exists for each word
* Executes on each word as it arrives
« Determines the significance of a word in context
+ Creates and reads expectations
* Builds up representation of the situation
Comprehension operators for the example
“plus” Create an object with name plus
vis" Expect a pre-object and a post-property
Create predicate: the property of the abject
“above” Expect a post-object
Create property: being above the object

“star” Create an object with name star

Figure 7-14, Soar comprehension of a sentence.

tack, once again, is simply to ask of Soar what is the natural way for
it to do the task—namely, to comprehend a sentence. In the back-
ground we have the operations of perception, encoding, and attend-
ing to the sentence on the display. We can take these operations as
delivering the sentence as a sequence of words, in order. If Soar
wants to comprehend the sentence, the natural thing for it to do is
to execute a comprehension operator on the sentence. Since Soar
acquires the sentence word by word, the natural thing is to execute
a comprehension operator on each word as it arrives. This is just a
version of the immediacy of interpretation principle of Just and
Carpenter (1987).

The use of the term natural conceals an important point. There
are many ways for Soar to implement the comprehension of sen-
tences, or do any other task. Indeed, there are also many ways for a
human to do so. A natural way is one that involves little additional
knowledge and little computational apparatus and indirection. It is
usually efficient, because it is straightforward, but it may not be the
most efficient, because some intricate algorithm might be better—
occasionally much better. The natural way is the place to begin
analysis but is not the end of analysis. Its heuristic nature must be
