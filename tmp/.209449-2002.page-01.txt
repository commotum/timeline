                        A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical degrees of
           .nature      freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is
                        that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in
                        their detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the richness of
                        motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two. Here we propose an alternative theory based on
           http://www   stochastic optimal feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of uncertainty is to
                        allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired
           oup          trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations that interfere with
                        task goals. From this framework, task-constrained variability, goal-directed corrections, motor
                        synergies, controlled parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge
                        naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor tasks to support this theory.
