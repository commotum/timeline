get itself to do the task, that is, to make a prediction. Because it
chunks what it does, Soar will thereby gain some permanent struc-
ture (which may then be wrong in later trials).

The second trial, in the middle column, follows immediately after
the first. Soar is presented another balance beam, for which its
prediction (produced by the operator built on the first trial) turns
out to be wrong. It is provided with this information by a feedback
operator in the P space in the upper left of the second column. It
then has to correct itself and when it succeeds in doing this, it is
operating at rule 1—which says look at weight only. It will apply
this rule to any balance-beam arrangement.

The third trial, in the right-hand column, follows the second.
Again, Soar is presented with a balance beam, for which its predic-
tion (produced by the operator incorporating rule 1) turns out to be
wrong. Again, it finds this out via a feedback operator in the P space
(called P3) at the upper left of the third column. Thus, Soar has to go
through another cycle of dealing with prior learning that has turned
out to be wrong. Success here leads it to operate at the level of rule
2—which says to respond according to weight (rule 1) unless weight
happens to be the same on both sides, in which case use distance. It
will apply this prediction scheme to any balance arrangement.

The fourth trial is not shown. It is like the third trial; the balanc-
ing task invalidates rule 2 and therefore provides the opportunity
once more for Soar to deal with learned information that is wrong.
Success at this task will lead Soar to learn rule 3. Soar takes this
step, just like it takes the ones shown on the figure.

However, Soar does not take the final step of going to rule 4.
There are good reasons why it shouldn't. The transition to rule 4 is
hot experimentally secure and indeed probably never occurs spon-
taneously by experiential learning. There are many ways to im-
prove the adequacy on the balance-beam task, without moving di-
rectly to the computation of torque. Rule 3 stops short of making
the reasoner have to cope with any trade-off between weight and
distance. A number of qualitative and partial numerical schemes are
available to deal with some aspects of compensation, and humans
do show some of these other intermediate rules. This is especially
true because the balance beam actually used is extremely simple,
with four equally spaced pegs and all weights identical. Thus, in
terms of an appropriate cognitive theory, Soar should not directly
learn the computation of torques. It should invent various more
