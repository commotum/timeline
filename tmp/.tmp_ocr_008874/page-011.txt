was deduced. The method of doing this is set forth in Appendix D.
This work resulted in the following table:
Relative Number

Signal of Letters for a
Elements Given Number of
per, Letter Signal Elements
American Morse (two current values)........... 8.26 74
Continental Morse (two current values) 8.45 73
Ideal (two current values). . 6.14 100
Continental Morse (three current values) . . 3.77 163
Ideal (three current values) ......-..00.0 e000 3.63 169

The column in the above table headed ‘‘Relative Number of Letters
for a Given Number of Signal Elements’? makes possible direct com-
parison with the results predicted from the formula as given in the
table which preceded. It will be noted that the ideal three-current-
value code gives an increase in the number of letters for a given
number of signal elements as compared with the ideal two-current-
value code which is in fair agreement with the theoretical ratio of
1.58:1. It will also be noted that the Continental three-current-
value code which is actually in use in the case of submarine cables
appears to come quite close to the ideal. In the case of the Conti-
nental and American Morse codes, however, where only two current
values are used, the results fall short of the ideal, the ratio between
the results actually obtained and the ideal being approximately 1.4:1.
The reason for this is that a certain proportion of the possible speed
is sacrificed in order to make it possible to read the signals by means
of a sounder instead of recording them. For instance, the dash has
been assumed to be approximately three times as long as the dot. If
the signals were mechanically formed at the sending end and recorded
at the receiving end, it would be possible to make use of markings
1, 2, 3, etc., signal elements long, as well as corresponding spacings.
The ideal codes were so constructed.

It will be seen that the figures deduced for the Continental Morse
and the American Morse are substantially identical for two current
values. This result probably does not correspond with practise;
it is thought that the difference in speed between these two codes is
considerably greater, say on the order of 10 or 15 per cent. in favor of
the American Morse. The discrepancy is due partly to the fact that
no account has been taken of figures and punctuation marks in the
present computations and partly to the fact that the assumptions as
to relative lengths of space is not strictly in accordance with practise.

From the foregoing, it is seen that there is a two-fold gain in chang-
ing from the two-current-value American or Continental Morse
codes to the three-current-value Continental code. In the first
