CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING TELEGRAPH SPEED 329

best from the standpoint of interference, since it contains the least
amount of these higher frequencies.

From the preceding it is concluded that for the case under con-
sideration, the wave form C in Fig. 1 produced by sending a rec-
tangular shaped signal element through a suitable network is the
most suitable. This wave form is almost the optimum from the
standpoint of the received signals while from the standpoint of inter-
ference into other circuits it leaves little to be desired.

CARRIER AND RapDIo

The results for the distortionless line are particularly applicable
to the cases of radio and carrier telegraphy because in these cases
we have a transmitting medium which is substantially distortionless.
We may again make use of Fig. 1 to illustrate three possible voltages,
it being understood that these curves represent the envelope or outline
of the transmitted currents which are in reality of a frequency con-
siderably higher than the signaling frequency. If now we limit con-
sideration to the case where the carrier frequency is located in the
middle of the transmitted frequency band, then, this case becomes
very similar to the direct-current case and what has been said about
the received wave shape being independent of the transmitted one
and its magnitude being directly proportional to the area under the
transmitted voltage curve still holds. One important difference is
that, whereas in the direct-current case the network shown at D,
Fig. 1, is used in the alternating-current case having the carrier
located in the middle of the free transmitted range, the network
shown at E, Fig. 1, is used. A further difference is that in the case
of radio where very high frequencies are involved, it may not be
practicable to construct the required networks. In that case, how-
ever, it is practicable to produce the corresponding direct-current
wave and utilize it to modulate the radio wave.

What was said about interference from the circuit in question
into other circuits in the direct-current case above also holds for the
case of radio and carrier with the difference that whereas Fig. 2
shows a band of frequencies extending from zero up, the corresponding
curve in the case of radio and carrier consists of two such bands.
The complete curve for radio and carrier is substantially symmetrical
with respect to the ordinate corresponding to the carrier frequency,
and the right-hand portion is similar to the curve shown in Fig. 2.
It will be obvious that the rectangular wave and the half-cycle sine
wave are both objectionable, as voltage waves to be applied to the
