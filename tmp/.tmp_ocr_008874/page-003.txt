sumed that the direct-current telegraph circuit is worked at as high
a speed as the frequency range assigned to it will permit.

A number of different wave forms which might be employed to
make up the telegraph signal elements will next be examined, con-
sideration being given first to the waves which will be received at the
distant end when the different wave forms are impressed at the trans-
mitting end and second to the interference which will be produced
in the higher range of frequencies which has been assigned to other
uses.

Three forms of voltage waves which will be considered are shown
in Fig. 1. A in that figure shows the simplest form of voltage wave,

namely, the ractangular form which is produced by applying a battery
for a given interval of time and then substituting a short circuit
for it. C in the figure is the wave produced by transmitting the
rectangular voltage wave A through an electrical network which is
the one indicated by the letter D in the figure. (Other forms of
networks might also be selected which would produce similar results.)
B in the figure is a wave which has the shape of a half cycle of a sine
wave. In what follows this wave will be referred to as the “half-

cycle sine wave.
In considering the waves which will be received when the above

waves are applied at the transmitting end, use will be made of the
following general principles, which have been stated by Malcolm,’
for the case of a submarine cable circuit and discussed for the general
case in Appendix A.
