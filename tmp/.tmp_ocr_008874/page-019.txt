the rectangular wave, the half-cycle sine wave, and the rectangular
wave extending through part of the dot provided the reference time
t=0 is properly chosen.

Returning to proposition IT, let us write

T
Si(U+1/2) =A'(tt+-ro+7/) i file) de,

the subscript ; indicating the particular type of impressed dot signal,
and 7 the value of 7 for any type of signal, taken as reference. Then

. T
SMU+7/2)=[ Atm) + ZA" +n) +... | [fleas (2a)

Now, the condition that proposition I shall hold to a good degree of
approximation is that the expansion (2a) shall converge rapidly.
Since the maximum possible value of 7; is T/2 and since in practise
it is much smaller than 7/2, the required convergence obtains for
much larger values of 7, that is, slower speeds of signaling than that
required in the expansion (1). Furthermore, for the three types of
signals specifically under consideration 7, rz and 73 differ from one
another by quantities very much smaller than 7/2 in all actual trans-
mission systems.

If the conditions of proposition ITI are introduced, the approximation
is still closer and proposition I is valid for still lower signaling speeds.

In order to arrive at quantitative ideas of the minimum signaling
speeds at which the foregoing proposition is valid, it is necessary,
of course, to specify the arrival curve of the transmission system
under consideration. An application of the foregoing analysis to
representative transmission systems both with and without a ‘‘cut-off”
frequency has shown that it is valid to a very good degree of approxi-
mation for speeds considerably lower than the highest attainable
under practical conditions.

APPENDIX B

Use has been made of the formula

W=K log m

where W =the speed of transmission of intelligence
K =aconstant

and m =the number of current values employed.

The assumptions which underlie this formula and its derivation will
now be given. :

Let us assume a code whose characters are all of the same duration.
This is usually the case in printer codes. If # is the number of signal
