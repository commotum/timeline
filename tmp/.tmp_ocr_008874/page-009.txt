the voltage curve, will be less. A cursory examination of the litera-
ture does not disclose that anything has been published on the experi-
mental side either to confirm or to oppose this result.

CHOICE OF CODES

A formula will first be derived by means of which the speed of trans-
mitting intelligence, using codes employing different numbers of
current values, can be compared for a given line speed, 7.e., rate of
sending of signal elements. Using this formula, it will then be shown
that if the line speed can be kept constant and the number of current
values increased, the rate of transmission of intelligence can be ma-
terially increased.

Comparison will then be made between the theoretical possibilities
indicated by the formula and the results obtained by various codes in
common use, including the Continental and American Morse codes as
applied to land lines, radio and carrier circuits, and the Continental
Morse code as applied to submarine cables. It will be shown that the
Continental and American Morse codes applied to circuits using
two current values are materially slower than the code which it is
theoretically possible to obtain because of the fact that these codes
are arranged so as to be readily deciphered by the ear. On the other
hand, the Continental Morse code, as applied to submarine cables,
or other circuits where three current values are employed, will be
shown to produce results substantially on par with the ideal. Taking
the above factors into account, it will be shown that if a given tele-
graph circuit using Continental Morse code with two current values
were rearranged so as to make possible the use of a code employing
three current values, it would be possible to transmit over the re-
arranged circuit about 2.2 times as much intelligence with a given
number of signal elements.

It will then be pointed out why it is not feasible on all telegraph
circuits to replace the codes employing two current values with others
employing more than two current values, so as to increase the rate
of transmitting intelligence. The circuits, for which the possibilities
of thus securing increases in speed appear greatest, are pointed out,
as well as those for which the possibilities appear least.
