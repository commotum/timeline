Preface

Daring the spring of 1987 I delivered the William James Lectures ut
Harvard University, This book is the record of the lectures. It puts
forward a thesis—that psychology is teady for unified theories of
cognition —and bends all the lectures tothe end of supporting that
thesis

Tt was indeed an honor to he asked to deliver the William James
Lectures. I was actually awed by the numberof people who came
to the initial lecture—the large auditorium was illed 1 overftowing
put mein mind ofthe great physiologist Chares Sherrington, who
save “The lntegrative Action of the Nervous System” as the Sil
‘man Lectures at Yale in 1904. It is reported that his first lecture
attracted a large and enthusiastic crowd, but by the lst lecture
there was an audience of just four people hanging on. This gave me
Pause, but i also helped me to sct my own goals for having atleast
five people at the end of my lectures. What's more, Sherrington’s
lectures were the basis for one of the great classics in newrophysiol-
‘ony (Sherrington, 1906), so I assuaged say anieties with the
thought that T would have a second chance, no matter how the
lectures themselves turned out. It did not occur to me then that
second chance implies. as the day the night, a second round of
anxieties. It occurs to me now, a I ship this book out fo the world,

There is, of course, no typical William James Lecturer—it even
seems somewhat odd to entertain the thought, However odd, I ant
certainly not it, My basie education i in physics and mathemtaties,
My graduate edueation isin industrial administration. Part of me is
rounded in applications and engineering, I've lived all my aca-
demic life in computer science department, and before that | was
immersed in the original think tank (the RAND Corporation), These
are not quite your average specs for 8 William James Lecturer
