14 = Unified Theories of Cognition

on the theory, not the theorist. Thus, theories tend to be cast in
terms of calculi, proof schemes, simulations—all things that tend to
objectify the body of knowledge and make the answering of ques-
tions routine, dependent only upon acquiring the skill of appli-
cation.

Theories are approximate. Of course, we all know that techni-
cally they are approximate; the world can’t be known with absolute
certainty. But I mean more than that. Theories are also deliberately
approximate. Usefulness is often traded off against truth. Theories
that are known to be wrong continue to be used, because they are
the best available. Fitts’ law is like that, How a theory is wrong is

carried along as part of the theory itself. Grossly approximate theo-
ties are continuous launching pads for better attempts. Fitts’ law is
like that too. The scientist does the best he can with what he's got—
and the engineer, who has to have answers, even more so.

Theories cumulate. They are refined and reformulated, corrected
and expanded. Thus, we are not living in the world of Popper (Pop-
per, 1959), as far as I'm concerned, we are living in the world of
Lakatos (Lakatos, 1970). Working with theories is not like skeet
shooting—where theories are lofted up and bang, they are shot
down with a falsification bullet, and that’s the end of that theory.
Theories are more like graduate students—once admitted you try
hard to avoid Alunking them out, it being much better for them and
for the world if they can become long-term contributors to society.

Theories are things to be nurtured and changed and built up. One
is happy to change them to make them more useful. Almost any
body of knowledge, structured in almost any sort of way, can enter
into a theory if it works. An especially powerful form for theory
is a body of underlying mechanisms, whose interactions and com-
positions provide the answers to alf the questions we have—
predictions, explanations, designs, controls. Such forms have been
at the bottom of all my examples. But, it is worth emphasizing, that
is because mechanisms are just what works. There is an over-
whelming amount of evidence that the world is put together this
way, so that theories described as systems of mechanisms give us
good answers. But mechanistic explanations have no special a
priori methodological or prescriptive status. Teleological principles
are also just fine when they work, as in the principle of the shortest
path (Fermat's principle) in geometrical optics.

In sum, when I talk about a unified theory of cognition, I'm
