tems by implementing representation laws so that the symbol struc-
tures encode the knowledge about the external world.

That’s all there is to be said about intentionality, except for the
details of how to build symbol systems that approximate knowledge
systems closely enough. The details are clearly important, but they
are details. Only if it were not possible to come close to realizing a
knowledge system would there be an issue.

However, let us ask how a knowledge system acquires the spe-
cific knowledge it has about the outside world—for this specific
knowledge is what leads to the symbols in the corresponding sym-
bol system. Within the knowledge level the answer is uninforma-
tive. The knowledge was acquired from other knowledge sources
that knew about the requisite outside world—what else? If the
question is pursued at the symbol level, however, the answer is
more useful. {n Figure 2-2, the blocks-world situation, ¥Y comes to
know that block B is not clear. Inside Y there is a representation
that supports that knowledge. That representation contains a sym-
bot for B and an expression for B not being clear. And the symbol
for B is about B, at least enough about 8 so that ¥’s knowledge that
Bis not clear is about B. No more, no less. How did ¥ find out that
Bis not clear? Y found it out because X told ¥. How did X know
that B was not clear? X knew it because X observed B. How did that
observation yield knowledge to X? Because light reflected from
block B was received by X's eyes, . . . Ultimately, there is some
physical contact with the object. It may feed through any collection
of agencies, supported by various other knowledge of physical laws
and facts. But the laws of our physical world imply that there must
be physical influence. '* If an agent is in complete physical isolation,
then ultimately nothing can be known. There are also issues of trust
and presupposition. Why did Y believe what X told Y? Was Y
warranted in its belief? Such issues are real and they affect whether
the knowledge is valid or reliable, but they do not affect whether on
occasion knowledge is transferred and with it the semantic function
of the symbols involved.

Let us return to the issue of approximation and the realizability of
the knowledge level. At every level of the computer-systems hier-
archy (Figure 2-3) the description from below is not exact with

14. It can of course be the influence of an antecedent, with extrapolation being by
physical laws and other inductions.
