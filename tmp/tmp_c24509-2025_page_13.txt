                   7 AdditionalImplementationDetails
                   In this section, we provide additional implementation details to assist in reproducing this work. Specifically,
                   we elaborate on the details of the datasets, DiT evaluation metrics, the specifics of our generation models,
                   and discussions on the downstream applications.
                   7.1   Datasets
                   Our experiments primarily utilize two datasets: Occ3D-Waymo [40] and CarlaSC [42]. Additionally, we also
                   evaluate our VAE on Occ3D-nuScenes [40].
                   The Occ3D-Waymo dataset is derived from real-world Waymo Open Dataset [37] data, where occupancy
                   sequences are obtained through multi-frame fusion and voxelization processes. Similarly, Occ3D-nuScenes is
                   generated from the real-world nuScenes [6] dataset using the same fusion and voxelization operations. On the
                   other hand, the CarlaSC dataset is generated from simulated scenes and sensor data, yielding occupancy
                   sequences.
                   Using these different datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method on both real-world and synthetic
                   data. To ensure consistency in the experimental setup, we select 11 commonly used semantic categories and
                   map the original categories from both datasets to these 11 categories. The detailed semantic label mappings
                   are provided in Tab. 6.
                       • Occ3D-Waymo. This dataset contains 798 training scenes, with each scene lasting approximately 20
                         seconds and sampled at a frequency of 10 Hz. This dataset includes 15 semantic categories. We use
                         volumes with a resolution of 200 ×200×16 from this dataset.
                       • CarlaSC. This dataset contains 6 training scenes, each duplicated into Light, Medium, and Heavy based
                         on trafÏc density. Each scene lasts approximately 180 seconds and is sampled at a frequency of 10 Hz.
                         This dataset contains 22 semantic categories, and the scene resolution is 128 × 128 × 8.
                       • Occ3D-nuScenes. This dataset contains 600 scenes, with each scene lasting approximately 20 seconds
                         and sampled at a frequency of 2 Hz. Compared to Occ3D-Waymo and CarlaSC, Occ3D-nuScenes has
                         fewer total frames and more variation between scenes. This dataset includes 17 semantic categories,
                         with a resolution of 200 × 200 × 16.
                   Table6 SummaryofSemanticLabelMappings. We unify the semantic classes between CarlaSC [42], Occ3D-Waymo [40],
                   and Occ3D-nuScenes [40] datasets for semantic scene generation.
