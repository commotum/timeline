fact, it gets a tie impasse between those three operators, which
leads down into a selection subspace (5), where it picks one indif-
ferently (since there is no knowledge to guide it). However, this at
least gives it a response, which it then makes in P space. This is the
end of the first trial. There is no feedback, so Soar doesn’t know
whether it is right or wrong, but Soar at least learns to respond in a
legitimate way (with one of the three predictions) when given a
balance-beam task.

The second trial occurs. Soar's interaction with the external ex-
perimental situation does not show. The task is projected entirely
into P space in the actual Soar run. The presented balance-beam is
received by the attend operator, Soar applies the prediction
operator, which uses the operator created in trial 1 to produce a
response; and the feedback from the experimenter is received (from
a production). Soar’s response is wrong (it was arranged to be that
way). Soar then rejects the prediction operator, because of this
external feedback. Soar now has a space in which the main operator
has been rejected. This is one form that bad spaces can take. Soar
still needs to respond, but the operator that is proposed to give the
response has been rejected. Thus, it now needs to manufacture a
new and more appropriate response. It also needs to be able to
select that new response in preference to the original and it needs to
do so without forever having to deal with the old response as a
candidate. In short, we have a paradigm example of the need to
discriminate upstream.

The essence of the solution is to construct a new problem space
that will take over the functions of the old one that contains the bad
learning, but without the bad learning. The process starts with an
impasse in P space, caused by the feedback from the failure to
respond correctly. This leads to a subspace (N) to generate a new
prediction problem space. This will be called space P2, but it is
necessary to generate an appropriate name for it so that it can be
accessed from P space. This is done in a generate-name space
(NN).

The two problem spaces, P2 and P, are related to each other ina
way partly analogous to inheritance in AI frame systems, namely,
P, is a P. Soar will enter P; and work in it as long as it can, but
whenever it cannot proceed, it will use the knowledge in P. This
will happen in P, anytime an impasse occurs. An impasse is exactly
