phenomena from lower levels percolate upward, ways that are not
to be described as errors.

As one moves up the hierarchy of system levels, size increases
and speed decreases. This is an obvious, but important, property
that follows directly from the nature of levels. Figure 3-1 shows the
situation. At level N, a collection of K components, say of charac-
teristic size §, are put together to form a component at level N + 1.
The size of this higher component is at least KS, but it would be
somewhat bigger because the level-N components are spread out in
space, with a certain amount of interstitial tissue of some sort. A
collection of K components of level N + 1 are put together to form
a component of level N + 2. This higher component is at least
K(KS) in size, hence K*S in terms of the bottom level. In general,
components of level N + m are K” times the size of components of
level N. Of course the number of components need not be the same
at each level, so that the K is some (geometric) mean value. In
summary, not only does the size increase with level, it does so geo-
metrically, so that the appropriate scale unit is the logarithm of the
linear size?

3. In space of two or three dimensions, the components can be packed together so
that the increase is by the logarithm of the area or volume; but it still comes to the same
thing in terms of the logarithmic nature of the scale.
