            et al., 2023). Early methods, such as PointNet (Qi et al., 2017a)
            and PointNet++ (Qi et al., 2017b), were groundbreaking in their
            application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to point cloud,
            allowing for processing in an unstructured manner. However, due to
            the inherent limitations of fixed-size and fixed-pattern convolutional
            kernels, these approaches overlook structural relationships between
            points of the same object, making it challenging of segmentation to
            effectively handle adherent and occluded instances. To address these           Fig. 2. Diagram of graph structure with its complexity. (a) Fully connected graph, (b)
