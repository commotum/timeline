        Extended Data Table 4 | A comparison between a geometry proof and an IMO inequality proof through the lens of the 
        AlphaGeometry framework
        We assume AM-GM to be a symbolic engine capable of (1) algebraic rewrites and simplification and (2) applying the inequality rule of arithmetic means–geometric means. With the original 
        premises, directly applying AM-GM fails to deliver a solution, which is similar to the geometry example, for which DD + AR fails to solve the simple problem. Some correct auxiliary constructions 
        are necessary for both symbolic engines (DD + AR in the case of geometry and AM-GM in the case of inequality) to succeed, as shown in the last two rows of the table. Note that there are ten 
        more common inequalities typically used at mathematical olympiads besides AM-GM, just as DD + AR itself encapsulates more than 50 different deduction rules for geometry commonly used at 
        the olympiads.
