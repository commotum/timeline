             Extended Data Fig. 4 | Side-by-side comparison of human proof and                quickly with the knowledge of Reim’s theorem, which is not included in the 
             AlphaGeometry proof for the IMO 2019 P2. This is one out of five unsolved        deduction rule list used by the symbolic engine during synthetic data 
             problems by AlphaGeometry. Left, the human solution uses both auxiliary          generation. Including such high-level theorems into the synthetic data 
             constructions and barycentric coordinates. With a well-chosen coordinate         generation can greatly improve the coverage of synthetic data and thus 
             system, a solution becomes available through advanced algebraic manipulation.    improve auxiliary construction capability. Further, higher-level steps using 
             Right, AlphaGeometry solution when provided with the ground-truth auxiliary      Reim’s theorem also cut down the current proof length by a factor of 3.
             construction for a synthetic proof. This auxiliary construction can be found
