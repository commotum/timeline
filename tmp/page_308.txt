work of an expert typist, the cognitive processor occupies the criti-
cal path most of the time. If the motor operator were slower, as
with a less expert typist, then the motor processor would be on the
critical path more frequently. To specify this model fully, we would
have to make a number of additional assumptions, which are listed
in the figure, (1) The perceptual process must be complete before
Tpey can begin. That is, the word has to be identified. (2) Heuer has to
wait for the prior motor operator (Mprior-ienter) t0 finish, if it is on the
same hand but not if it is on the opposite hand. This constraint
reflects the buffering between J and M, in particular, the nonability
of M to sort out commands or to have any local memory of them.
(3) There is also a short-term memory assumption on the capacity
of the buffer between perception (P-E-A-C) and cognition (/). This
is simply set at 3 words, which we just accept as an approximate
fixed number. Finally, in line with the SRC theory and with our
initial development of this model in terms of the MHP, we use
the same times as John did in her analysis: 314 ms for perception
{P-E-A-C} and 66 ms for a cognitive operator (any of the fs). We
