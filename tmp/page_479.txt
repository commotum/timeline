pseudoproblem, and it is a problem where again we need to listen to
the architecture, The architecture of Soar comes equipped with two
error-recovery mechanisms (Figure 8-6). First, Soar does every-
thing in problem spaces. Problem spaces are fundamentally error-
recovery mechanisms, although that way of viewing them is per-
haps not too commion. To go down one path in a problem space is to
be capable of backing off, for whatever reason, and going down an
alternative path. That is an error-recovery procedure. If problem
spaces were the only recovery mechanism that Soar had, it would
in effect have to problem-solve its way through life, repeating life's
early errors each time before finding a workable solution,

The second Soar mechanism for error recovery can be called
