               Figure 7 Dynamic Scene Generation Applications. We demonstrate the capability of our model on a diverse set of
               downstream tasks. We show the 1st, 8th, and 16th frames for simplicity. Kindly refer to the Appendix for complete
               sequential scenes and longer temporal modeling examples.
               a 7.05% mIoU improvement, significantly boosts training speed by up to 2.06x, and reduces memory usage by
               a substantial 70.84%.
               HexPlane Dimensions. The dimensions of HexPlane have a direct impact on both training efÏciency and
               reconstruction quality. Table 4 provides a comparison of various downsample rates applied to the original
               HexPlane dimensions, which are 16 × 128 × 128 × 8 for CarlaSC and 16 × 200 × 200 × 16 for Occ3D-Waymo.
               As the downsampling rates increase, both the compression rate and training efÏciency improve significantly,
               but the reconstruction quality, measured by mIoU, decreases. To achieve the optimal balance between training
