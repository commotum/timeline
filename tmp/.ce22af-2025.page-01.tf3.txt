                  4Dpanoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is crit-
               ical for highly dynamic environments, such as evacuating
               dense crowds and autonomous driving in complex scenar-
               ios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a con-
               strained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
               4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-
               Thread System to efficiently process streaming frames. The
               framework is general and can be seamlessly integrated into
               existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable real-
               time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness
               compared to existing streaming perception approaches,
