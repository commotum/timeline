that ultimately contact must be made with cognition. On the per-
ceptual side, there could be other buffers embedded in P, P could
put elements into some special memory and another special device
could move them into the working memory. The figure is simply
silent on this. One might think that cognition could perhaps exam-
ine directly such a structurally distinct buffer. But it is doubtful that
this proposal differs from having productions with conditions that
match working-memory elements with distinguishing tags, because
productions are the only way cognition has of examining anything,
and what productions examine is called working memory.

On the motor side, additional buffering could exist within M, to
make information available to internal components of M at appro-
priate times. The figure is equally silent on this. However, motor
actions could be direct actions of productions that went to such
special motor memories, without ever showing up in the working
memory. This direct-action scheme might seem simpler than the
indirect one of Figure 4-15, where cognition puts elements in work-
ing memory to be communicated to the motor system. Indeed,
almost all existing production systems (including Ops5) employ
general right-hand side actions and not the indirect scheme. Direct
action has a fatal flaw, however. It implies the possibility of sudden
death. If a production containing a dangerous motor command
(say, Kill thyself!) were ever triggered, there would be no way to
sense or revoke it. Motor commands, of course, affect the external
world and, as such, are ultimately irreversible. So the question is
what types of security are to be provided for such operations, not
whether commitment can be avoided completely. Direct action im-
plies that responsibility resides in the(Psurance that a sudden-death
production will never be fired or will never be created. But this is
untenable given the design of central cognition in Soar. For Soar,
security resides in the decision cycle, which has been judiciously
set up to provide protection against irreversible actions, including
internal ones. The elaboration cycle is totally permissive, but it
runs to quiescence precisely to permit whatever is known immedi-
ately to be brought to bear. The decision procedure is the watch-
guard to ensure that some rogue production producing a rogue ac-
tion will at least have a chance of being sidelined. Thus, although on
formal grounds direct motor action from production actions might
be simpler, such a design is not admissible for Soar.

The total system consists of more than P to C to M. There is a set
