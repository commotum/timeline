chunking. No additional mechanisms are involved. Impasses and
chunks have exactly the right characteristics (the filtering) for this
task. They are not being bent out of shape to perform it.

To return to the problem-space-level trace in Figure 8-7, the
second trial comprises two columns (both shown in the middle of
the figure}. The left one (which is what we have just been through)
constructs P;. The right one uses P; to construct a new response by
constructing a new prediction operator. At the top we see the P,
space leading to P space by means of impasses. There is actually
more than one trip between the two spaces. The task is to generate
a new operator, which leads to the G space, just as happened in trial
1. However, the G space has learned to produce the original
operator. Thus, although it is possible to reject this operator—that
is, not to produce the inappropriate operator—it is necessary to
obtain a new generate-operator space, G2, which will bear the same
relation to the G space as P, bears to P space. And, indeed, the
entire pattern recurs of G space to N space to NN space, producing
G, space, backed up by G space. Working now in G2 space, an
appropriate new operator is constructed that satisfies the task re-
quirements. This is not difficult because the feedback provides the
information about what response is appropriate. It is a question of
hooking the comparison information up with the correct prediction
response (the correct one of the three). At this point, Soar is now
working essentially at the level of rule 1, of taking into account
weight only.

Soar arrives at the third trial. The same situation repeats itself
(because the experimenter arranges it so). The prediction operator
{created on trial 2) produces the wrong response to the balance-
beam task and this is noted by the feedback from the experimenter.
Thus, the now-familiar pattern of P, to N to NN occurs to produce
anew problem space, P;, which is backed up by P2. There is now a
three-tiered hierarchy of prediction spaces. Starting in P; to get a
new prediction operator leads Soar down to P;, which in turn leads
to G2.'5 In Gz, a new difficulty arises, namely that there is no way to
create a new operator that is satisfactory, just by changing the way

15. It might be thought the path should go from P, to P, to P in order to get to Gz, but
it turms out that the direct link from P, to G; is created by one of the chunks created in
trial 2. The story of why that direct bit of inheritance works, why Soar need not forever
have to work ail the way to the bottom of a growing hierarchy—P,, P,-1...., P1, P—is
too detailed for this exposition.
