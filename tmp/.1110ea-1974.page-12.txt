                                The first conclusion                      from this study is that performance                                       on the                                              continuous             presentation              and test of digit sequences throughout                                         the
                           secondary memory component of free recall is adversely effected by                                                                                                           presentation              of the memory list. In this way, it was hoped to keep
                           a digit preload,                 with the size of the decrement                                being a function of                                                           the memory load relatively constant throughout the list and so avoid

                           There are, however, at least two classes of interpretations                                                        of this re·                                               Experiment               VI and involved the visual presentation                                               of digit se-
                           suit. The first is to conclude that an STM preload does not interfere                                                                                                        quences.

                           conclusion, since the "standard" account of recency assumes that the                                                                                                         blank interval during which S was required to recall and write down

The three-digit                            concurrent             load condition                was similar

To accept this hypothesis would require                                                                                                           except that the three-digit                            sequences            were presented                  for only two

                            preload items at the beginning of the list, and by the end of the list                                                                                                      followed, respectively,                      by gaps of two and four seconds. In this con-
