                     Figure 15: Best-of-N (N=100) comparison on Crafter. The plot shows achievements versus episode
                     steps for each method, evaluated on the best of N trajectories. Human collaboration (N = 20)
                     demonstrates the strongest progression, followed by SFT+RL plan dynamically and SFT+RL no plan,
                     with base RL baselines lagging behind.
                     Toquantify the upper bound of performance, we conducted a Best-of-N analysis, comparing the best
                     runs attained by each method across 100 independent runs, and 20 runs for the human collaboration.

                     impact of human steering and further validates the benefits of conditioning the models with plans.
