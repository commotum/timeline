Fig. 7b, and the R/R, biases are as follows:

RR, Hebaomss
sy 10 15 Ry
So 11 19 Ry
8, 10 18 Ry
3), Ly. 10 Ry
Sy 14 13 Ry
86 1h 10 Ry

Note that every response has reversed itself correctly, even though

the ratio in the case of Sy is very close.

It has been confirmed by a limited model-sampling study
of transformations of stimuli in a 0x0 raster, with specified connections
to a set of A-units, that anA-unit typically shows a bias to respond to
one type of stimulus pattern more than others, For example, a particular
A-unit might respond to 20% of all possible transpositions of a square,
and perhaps to 1%, or even 0% of the set of transformations of a circle.
A bias of this sort is shown clearly in our model, where the A-unit in
the fifth row and second column is seen to respond to each of the first
three stimuli, and to none of the last three, One way of accounting for
the discrimination phenomenon is to point out that a stimulus from the
transformation set, Tj, is more likely to excite A-units which are
biased towards the set qT, than units which are biased towards some other

set, Tye But the units with a qT, bias will have a corresponding value~
