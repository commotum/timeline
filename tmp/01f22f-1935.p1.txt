                                In a complete theory there is an element corresponding                 quantum      mechanics     is not   complete    or (2) these two

                             reality of a physical quantity     is the possibility  of predicting      of the problem of making predictions          concerning    a system
                             it  with   certainty,    without    disturbing    the   system.     In    on the basis of measurements        made on another system that
                             quantum     mechanics in the case of two physical quantities              had previously     interacted   with it leads to the result that if
                             described   by non-commuting        operators,   the knowledge      of    (1)is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude
                             one precludes the knowledge        of the other. Then either (1)          that the description     of reality as given by a wave function
