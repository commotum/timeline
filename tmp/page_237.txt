layer of the Soar model of the architecture and assign whatever
timing functions fit the human data. However, the computational
requirements of matching are as much a requirement on the biolog-
ical system as on any other computational system. The possible
algorithms that accomplish pattern matching need to be explored to
understand how long they take and what dependencies they exhibit.
One constraint is definite. The pattern match should be an associa-
tive memory structure with the same computational powers as the
