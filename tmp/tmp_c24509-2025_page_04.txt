                 Figure2 Pipelineofdynamicscenegeneration. Our DynamicCity framework consists of two key procedures: (a) Encoding
                 HexPlane with an VAE architecture (cf. Sec. 4.1), and (b) 4D Scene Generation with HexPlane DiT (cf. Sec. 4.2).
                 2D feature planes, each aligned with one of the major planes in the 4D spacetime grid. These planes are
                 represented as H = [P ,P ,P ,P ,P ,P ], comprising a Spatial TriPlane [8] with P , P , and P ,
                                       xy   xz   yz  tx   ty  tz                                           xy   xz        yz

                 are extracted from the corresponding coordinates on each of the six planes and fused into a comprehensive
                 representation. This fused feature vector is then passed through a lightweight network to predict scene
                 attributes for p.
                 DiffusionTransformers (DiT) [26] are diffusion-based generative models using transformers to gradually convert
                 Gaussian noise into data samples through denoising steps. The forward diffusion adds Gaussian noise over
                                                                    ‚àö         ‚àö

                 4 OurApproach
                 DynamicCity strives to generate dynamic 3D occupancy with semantic information, which mainly consists
                 of a VAE for 4D occupancy encoding using HexPlane [7, 11] (Sec. 4.1), and a DiT for HexPlane generation
                (Sec. 4.2). Given a 4D scene, i.e., a dynamic 3D occupancy sequence Q ‚àà RT√óX√óY√óZ√óC, where T, X, Y, Z,
                 and C denote the sequence length, height, width, depth, and channel size, respectively, the VAE first aims to
                 encode an ef√ècient 4D representation, HexPlane H = [P    , P  , P  , P , P  , P ], which is then decoded for
                                                                        xy   xz   yz  tx   ty  tz
                 reconstructing 4D scenes with semantics.
                 After obtaining HexPlane embeddings, DynamicCity leverages a DiT-based framework for 4D occupancy
                 generation. Diverse conditions could be introduced into the generation process, facilitating a range of
                 downstream applications (Sec. 4.3). The overview of the proposed DynamicCity pipeline is illustrated in
                 Fig. 2.
