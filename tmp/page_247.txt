234 # Unified Theories of Cognition

No attempt has been made to design Soar to satisfy the rest of
the constraints—development, living in a social community, self-
awareness, realization as a neural system, or its construction by the
processes of embryology, and ultimately of evolution. Chapter 3
showed that the real-time constraint, in concert with using neural
technology, determines a lot of features of the architecture—and
that these features are largely present in Soar—but such consider-
ations did not enter into the Soar design and had not been artic-
ulated then.

Finally, the description of our candidate architecture for a unified
theory of cognition is complete. The candidate has become very
specific, not only in its mechanisms, which exist in integrated oper-
ational form in Soar, but also in the mapping between the architec-
ture and human cognition. The task for the rest of the book is to
illustrate, by bringing this candidate into contact with many differ-
ent facets of human cognition, in varying degrees of detail, what a
unified theory of cognition should provide.
