                                 both the retrieved token and its surrounding context. We observe that many of the gains in cross-
                                 entropy loss took place when trying to predict the name of bibitems, citations, or references, by
                                 looking up the references and citations used previously in the paper. Such lookups usually span over
                                 the entire paper, which is much longer than 8192 tokens, providing a plausible explanation for the
                                 gain beyond memory size of 8192.

                                 tokens the model retrieved from memory. As might be expected, the model is often looking up the
                                 namesoffunctions, and variables, as shown in Table 18.
