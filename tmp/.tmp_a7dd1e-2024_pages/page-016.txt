                          of referential relationships, specifically focusing on anaphora, which reflect realistic inquiries that
                          users might pose to large-scale models. You are required to use anaphora to generate multi-turn
                          dialogues between ‘Human’ and ‘Assistant’, where anaphora is a linguistic term for a reference to
                          something mentioned earlier in the dialogue.
                          Step 1: ‘Human’ poses a question.
                          Step 2: ‘Assistant’ answers the question.
                          Step 3: A follow-up question is asked about the first round’s answer, using anaphora to refer back
                          to some content from the first round’s answer.
                          Step 4: The question is answered.
                          Step 5: The fifth step involves another follow-up question about the first round’s answer, again
                          using anaphora to refer to certain content.
                          Step 6: In the sixth step, the question is answered.
                          Youcanrefer to these examples:
                          # Example 1 #

                          # Example 3 #
                          Please ensure that the anaphoric references in the third and fifth steps effectively demon-
                          strate the model’s capability to understand and resolve referential expressions.
                          Please output the dialogue content directly with ‘Human:’ and ‘Assistant:’ as role prompts,
                          without stating ‘step1’, ‘step2’, and so on.
