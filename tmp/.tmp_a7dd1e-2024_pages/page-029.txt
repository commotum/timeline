                     The AI assistant’s general reasoning capabilities are crucial for accurately addressing and
                     explaining a wide range of problems posed by ‘Human’. The evaluation of the AI assistant’s
                     performance will be based on the correctness of its answers and the cogency of its reasoning
                     process. The evaluation criteria are as follows:
                     1.   Verify the accuracy of the AI assistant’s answer against the provided reference solu-
                     tion in the format ‘### reference solution ###‘ for the specific problem.
                     2. Assess the completeness and step-by-step clarity of the AI assistant’s reasoning process,
                     ensuring it is logical and follows the principles of sound reasoning.
                     3. Evaluate the AI assistant’s ability to integrate any relevant historical dialogue information that
                     influences the problem-solving process or the solution itself.
                     4. Appraise the AI assistant’s communication of the solution in a manner that is understandable
                     and instructive to ‘Human’, potentially aiding their learning or comprehension.
                     Scoring Guidelines:
                     1-3 points: The AI assistant provides incorrect answers and/or fails to offer a clear and
                     logical reasoning process, missing key steps or providing explanations that do not adhere to
                     standards of sound reasoning.
                     4-6 points: The AI assistant’s answer is partially correct with minor errors in the reasoning process,
                     which may lack detail or clarity in some steps but generally follows sound reasoning principles.
                     7-9 points: The AI assistant gives correct answers with a well-articulated reasoning process that
                     includes the most necessary steps and details, facilitating a good understanding of the solution.
                     10points: The AI assistant provides a completely correct answer accompanied by a detailed and
                     meticulously clear step-by-step reasoning process that is fully aligned with sound reasoning
                     principles and enhances ‘Human’s understanding.
                     When scoring, focus on the precision of the AI assistant’s answer and the extent to which the
                     reasoning process is elaborated. The assistant’s ability to effectively communicate complex
                     solutions in a manner that supports ‘Human’s learning is indicative of high performance. If

                     Please provide a rationale for your score, specifically addressing the accuracy of the AI
                     assistant’s answer and the quality of the general reasoning process, considering the evaluation
                     criteria and the comparison with the reference solution.
