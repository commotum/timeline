         Youarerequired to generate English multi-turn dialogue data or assessing the model’s ability to
         withstand contextual interference, follow these steps:
         Step 1: Create the initial question for the first round.
         Step 2: Generate a response to the first round’s question.
         Step 3: Construct a subsequent question that closely mirrors the syntactic structure of the first
         question but differs significantly in meaning or implication, potentially leading to model confusion.
         Step 4: Respond to this second round’s question, taking care to accurately interpret any elements of
         the question that may be ambiguous, have connotative meanings, or require specialized knowledge
         before providing a standard answer.
         Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 to generate further rounds of questions and answers, ensuring each
         new question introduces a distinct potential point of confusion while structurally resembling
         previous ones.
         Youcanrefer to these examples:
         # Example 1 #
         # Example 2 #
         # Example 3 #
         While answering, it is important to accurately interpret any ambiguous, connotative, or
         technical content within the question before giving a standard response. Finally, repeat the third
         and fourth steps to create additional rounds of Q&A. Please refrain from including labels such as
         ‘step1’, ‘step2’, and so on in the output.

         You are required to generate English test data to evaluate the model’s capacity for generating
         clarifying questions. ‘Human’ begins by asking a question that either lacks certain conditions or
         contains content that is ambiguous or unclear. In the subsequent dialogue rounds, ‘Assistant’ will
         ask counter-questions to address the missing conditions or clarify the unclear portions. ‘Human’
         will then respond to these inquiries. This process continues until the intent is clear and the
         conditions are explicitly defined, at which point ‘Assistant’ will provide a detailed and specific
         answer. Please omit labels such as ‘step1’, ‘step2’, etc., from the output.
