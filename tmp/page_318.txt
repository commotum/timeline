This chapter has a secondary theme. To paraphrase a famous
line: there are more things in an architecture, Horatio, than are
dreamt of in your theorizing. An architecture should be taken seri-
ously and out of it will come interesting and important things about
the nature of cognition. It is the same with any good theory. For
instance, if one tries to think directly about the nature of semantic
memory or episodic memory, one hardly understands the pos-
sibilities that exist for realizing such memories. When presented
with a full-fledged architecture, the possibilities simply emerge. Dif-
ferent architectures, of course, offer different possibilities. A single
architecture exhibits only one arrangement of the possibilities. An
important aspect of each architecture-embodied unified theory of
cognition is its capacity for generating new possibilities. This will
be true of any such unified theory, not just Soar, but it is an impor-
tant lesson to be taught through Soar.

6.1. The Memory and Learning Hypothesis of Soar

Three fundamental assertions capture much of what the Soar ar-
chitecture implies about human memory and learning. They are a
good place to start.

The first assertion is the functional unity of long-term memory
(LTM). All long-term memory consists of recognize-retrieve units
with a fine grain of modularity. In Soar these are productions, but
productions should be taken simply as a convenient computational
realization. There may be other ways of building memory systems
that are both recognition memories and fine grained. On the other
hand, given these functional specifications, the major variation re-
maining is the specific recognition scheme—the power of the
