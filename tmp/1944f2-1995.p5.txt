                   ity, only the 900-270 ° and 2700-900 ensemble is illustrated. For now, the organization of the pyramidal cells with particular memory fields is 
                   hypothetical, as is the reciprocity of the excitatory-inhibitory units. Further analysis of these local circuits is essential for analyzing the neural 
                   substrates of working memory.
