Figure 6-20. Soar on multiple short-term memories.

hoc exploitation of these short-term memories implies that their use
is strategic—metacognitive is the term that has become familiar
(Brown, 1978). Soar situates metacognition of short-term memory
within the total processing context, which means that to discover
what is true of STM metacognition we need only explore Soar
without resorting to additional theory.'° However, not ail short-
term memory is strategic—management of the goal context stack is
built into the architecture. If it were not so, no way would exist to
behave prior to learning the strategic use of short-term memory.

Soar will show interference effects in the use of these extra short-
term memories. Interference follows from the nature of attention
(A). When the decision is made to redirect attention to the to-be-
remembered item (the act of STM retrieval), a search is required.
The exact item cannot be known for Soar—indeed, if it were, Soar
would have kept the item in its continuously accessible working
memory. Thus, the attention operator must seek the item, and it
must do so by simple criteria. This means it may not only recover
the item (assuming that it is stiil there), but it may get several others
as well. This will be especially true if, as in classical STM experi-
mental paradigms, multiple items can be distinguished only by their
class membership—all digits, for example, or all faces.

Soar STM will exhibit multiple codes, corresponding to the codes
of the fields that are exploited for the short-term memory. Certain
codes may be dominant (for example, acoustic/articulatory), simply
because they are the predominant fields used, and this predomi-
nance may itself derive from ease of controlling such a memory or
