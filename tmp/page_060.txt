Figure 2-3. The hierarchy of computer systems.

Consider the familiar computer-systems hierarchy, shown in Fig-
ure 2-3, which we will encounter repeatedly in the course of this
book. A computer system can be described in many ways. It can be
described as a system of electronic devices, or as an electrical
circuit, or as a logic circuit, or as a register-transfer system, or as a
programming system. There are other ways as well, ways that are
hot related to its primary function, such as an item of cost in a
budget, a contributor to floor loading, or an emblem of being high-
tech. All the descriptions based on the computer as a behaving
system are types of machines. In each case there is some kind of
medium that is processed. Working up from the bottom, the media
are electrons, current, bits, bit vectors, and data structures. At any
moment, the state of the system consists of some configuration of
its medium. There are behavior laws that can be used to predict the
behavior of the system. Electrons are particles that move under
impressed electromagnetic forces; electrical circuits obey Ohm’s
law and Kirchhoff's law; logic circuits obey Boolean algebra; the
processing in programs obeys the stipulated programming lan-
guage. In each case, if we know the state of the system and the laws
of its behavior, we can obtain the state of the system at some point
