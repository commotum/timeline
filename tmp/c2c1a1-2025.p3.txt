                         • Graph Perceiver IO generalizes a multimodal method to the graph do-
                           main by designing specific graph features to reflect the topological in-
                           formation.
                         • Compared to the graph neural networks, Graph Perceiver IO requires
                           a lower complexity, and it can handle the global and local information
                           efÏciently.
                         • By extending to two separated decoders, Graph Perceiver IO+ incor-
                           porates both images and graphs simultaneously for the multimodal
                           few-shot classification.
                         • The Graph Perceiver IO(+) is the single unified model that takes in-
                           put and output flexibly, and it handles diverse datasets such as graph
                           structured data as well as text and images.
