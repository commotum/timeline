               amplitude (A) and offset (B). Autocorrelation offset (B) reflects the strength of contributions with long timescales, which do not decay substantially 
               within the fixation epoch. (b) Autocorrelation offset increases with intrinsic timescale. Colored lines show trends for individual data sets. The arrow 
               shows the slope of dependence from a regression analysis (slope m = 0.8 ± 0.2 kHz). Error bars indicate s.e.m. (c) In the Lee data set, we previously 
               measured timescales characterizing the decay of modulation of single-neuron firing rates by reward events while monkeys performed a competitive 
               decision-making task11 for areas LIP (n = 160), LPFC (n = 243) and ACC (n = 134). The ordering of areas by reward timescale aligns with the ordering 
               by intrinsic timescale. Error bars indicate standard error for fit parameter and median.
