the order is correct, that is, consistent, and then it fills out the
order. There are many things to be specified beyond the main items
that the customer specifies, for example, cable lengths and power
supplies. R1 lays out the components in cabinets and modules. Its
output is a schematic that describes all of the details of the system
and how it is to be assembled. In specifying this configuration, it
takes into account large numbers of facts and considerations—the
cost of components, the power demands, cable lengths, compara-
bility constraints between components, and so on.

Configuring Vaxes is a good example of a knowledge-intensive
task done relatively well by human experts. Anyone of reasonable
intelligence, general technical education, and diligence can con-
figure Vaxes. However, the person does have to know ail about
Vaxes and know about them in gritty detail. Given a lot of practice
and access to the information on Vaxes in manuals, tables, produc-
tion specs, and the Digital production organization, a person be-
comes skilled at the task. Even with reasonable familiarity, humans
engage in some amount of search—of fiddling to find an appropriate
configuration. Only with time does the skill build up and require
hardly any search.

RI is a good example of an AI expert (or knowledge-based) sys-
tem that is capable of expert-level performance. RI, however, is
not quite a typical expert system. Configuration is a simple type of
design task, and most expert systems perform diagnostic tasks.
Moreover, RI is one of the largest expert systems. It comprised
about 3,300 rules at the time of the Soar study (1984), with a data
base of about 10,000 components, and has grown substantially
since thea.

R1-Soar was created early in Soar's career, as the first attempt
to work with a realistic task (Rosenbloom, Laird, McDermott,
Newell, & Orciuch, 1985; van de Brug, Rosenbloom, & Newell,
1986). Ri-Soar does a substantial component of the Vax configu-
ration task, It does not do it the same way that RI does. The project
was not to simulate RI in Soar, but rather to use exactly the same
knowledge, so that exactly the same configurations will be ob-
tained, which maximizes the opportunity for learning from the com-
parison of R1-Soar with RI. R!-Soar provided about 25 percent of
the total functionality of R1, mainly configuring the unibus, which
was deemed to be the demanding part of R1. This is enough cover-
