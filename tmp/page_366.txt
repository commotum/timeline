354 © Unified Theories of Cognition

As noted, Soar does not have a well-developed theory of short-
term memory. There is a good reason for this. A persistent theme of
the STM history just related is that STM’s small capacity and short
lifetime is a brute fact. It is assumed to be a technological limita-
tion—as if neural technology and evolution could not have devel-
oped a large-capacity short-term memory to eliminate the STM
effects that we assess as limitations. STM theories typically posit
structural features, such as limited storage capacity, rapid decay, or
interference, to account for the STM effects. Such technological
assumptions are foreign to Soar at its current stage of development.
Soar’s mechanisms are dictated by the functions required of a gen-
eral cognitive agent. We have not posited detailed technological
limitations to Soar mechanisms.® There is nothing inappropriate or
wrong with such constraints. They may well exist, and if they do,
they must show up in any valid theory.

There is likely to be some difficulty in getting evidence for such
technological limitations independent of the STM effects they are to
explain, at least until direct neurophysiological indications emerge
(1 know of no attempts to ask the question empirically}. The
difficulty is that a feature can be dysfunctional for some class of
tasks (such as remembering looked-up phone numbers) but still be
functional for some other tasks, so that the dysfunction expresses
not a technological limitation but a trade-off between multiple
facets of behavior. Thus, given the starting point of Soar in func-
tionalism, the obvious strategy is to attempt to extend its functional
potential as far as possible, to provide as clear a picture as possible
against which to detect technological limits.

We can attempt to read out of Soar the outlines of a functional
theory of short-term memory—that is, what short-term phenomena
might arise just because of how Soar must be designed in order to
perform, learn, and interact with the external world. Insofar as
design explains some STM regularities, then technological limita-
tions need not be posited to do so. This is a worthwhile exercise,
even if technological limitations exist. STM phenomena that arise
for functional reasons will still arise (for the same reason) even
when technological limitations are added to the theory.

8. We have posited that Soar can be built using neural technology (Chapter 3). How-
ever, this claim operates in a very global way to dictate the cognitive system levels; it is
not a model for a detailed cechnological mechanism that constrains specific operations.
