                             Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS) is the computational problem of ﬁnding an implementation f that
                             meets both a semantic constraint given by a logical formula ϕ in a background theory T, and a
                             syntactic constraint given by a grammar G, which speciﬁes the allowed set of candidate implementa-
                             tions. Such a synthesis problem can be formally deﬁned in SyGuS-IF, a language that is built on top
                             of SMT-LIB.

                             competition we added a new track devoted to programming by examples. This track consisted of

                             presents and analyses the results of SyGuS-Comp’16.
                      1    Introduction
                      The Syntax-Guided Synthesis Competition (SyGuS-Comp) was originally developed as a community
                      effort in order to provide an objective basis to compare different approaches to solving the Syntax-
                      Guided Synthesis problem. In this style of synthesis, the user provides a speciﬁcation in the form of a
                      logical formula ϕ in a background theory T, and a space of programs given as a grammar G; the goal
                      of the synthesizer is to ﬁnd a program in the space that satisﬁes the given speciﬁcation. Concretely, if
                      the speciﬁcation uses an unknown function f, the goal is to ﬁnd a function fimp that is expressible in the
                      grammarGandsuchthattheformulaϕ[f/fimp]isvalid for all values of its free variables.

                      standard format for benchmarks. The SyGuS format is detailed in other publications [7, 2],[22, 5, 6], but
                      at a high-level, the SyGuS format is based on the popular SMT-LIB format for deﬁning SMT problems
                      and is extended to support the description of function grammars. The SyGuS format has been extended
                      over the last two years to provide special support for important classes of problems such as Invariant
                      Synthesis, or problems involving expressions in integer linear arithmetic [5]. In its 2016 iteration, the
                      format was also extended to support Programming by Example problems [6], which are becoming an
                      important area of study in the synthesis community.
                          In the short time that the formalism has been in public circulation, it has already performed well in
                      its goal of facilitating research in synthesis while providing a basis for objective comparison of different
                      algorithms. For example, the competition has provided important insights into the relative merits of
                      different algorithms [3, 2, 7] which have been exploited to help develop and evaluate new algorithms [11,
                      15, 24, 26, 18, 4, 12]. Beyond synthesizer developers, there is a growing community of users that is
                      coalescing around the formalism.
                          SyGuS has found various interesting applications among which are motion planning [8], compiler
                      optimizations, and cybersecurity [9]. Remarkably, Eldib et al. report that a circuit for mitigating time-

               delay attacks generated via SyGuS is much smaller than a handcrafted circuit mitigating the same attack,
               as well as the original circuit (which is vulnerable to that attack). The SyGuS generated circuit used 13
               gates compared to 41 of the handcrafted circuit and 21 of the original, and has a shorter critical path: 3
               unit delay vs. 6 unit delay of the mitigated and original circuits.
               1.1  TheGeneralTrack
               Wenowillustrate the key ideas behind the main formalism and the extensions that have been added in
               the last two years through a series of illustrative examples.
               Example Weillustrate the general SyGuS-Comp formalism with this simple example from one of the
               competition benchmarks. This example is taken from an implementation of a quantum control computer
               (QCC).1 The QCC uses expressions from the following grammar:
                                              g::=c|g+g|g−g|g?g
               where c is any integer constant, + is addition, − is substraction, and a?b stands for “if a ≥ 0 then a else
               b”. This minimal set of instruction is used to enable a fast implementation. High level commands should
               betranslated to this grammar using a minimal number of operations, since these operations participate in
               a pipeline, thus every unnecessary delay multiplies. The goal in the following benchmark is to ﬁnd two
               functions qm-inner-loop and qm-outer-loop that decrement an inner and outer loop (the inner from
               7 to 0, the outer from 3 to 0) formally deﬁned as follows for x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.
                                      qm-inner-loop(x)= 7       if x = 0
                                                           x−1 ifotherwise
                                                         3     if x = 0 ∧ y = 0
                                   qm-outer-loop(x,y)= y−1 ifx=0 ∧ y6=0
                                                         y     otherwise
                  These constraints can be succinctly expressed in the SyGuS format as shown below.

                The set-logic directive indicates that the constraints should be interpreted in terms of the theory of
                linear integer arithmetic. The directive declare-var is used to declare x and y as universally quantiﬁed
                integer variables. The constraints are introduced with the directive constraint, and check-synth

                orderforthesynthesizertogenerateqm-inner-loopandqm-outer-loop,itneedsagrammar,whichis
                provided as part of the synth-fun directive. The speciﬁed grammar provides exactly the set of allowed
                operations for the QCC.
                1.2   Conditional Linear Integer Arithmetic Track
                For problems where the grammar consists of the set of all possible integer linear arithmetic terms, it is
                sometimes possible to apply specialized solution techniques that exploit the information that decision
                procedures for integer linear arithmetic are able to produce. The 2015 SyGuS competition included a
                separate track where the grammar for all the unknown functions was assumed to be the entire theory of
                Integer Linear Arithmetic with ITE conditionals.
                 R. Alur, D. Fisman, R. Singh & A. Solar-Lezama                                                181
                 Example Asasimpleexample,considertheproblemofsynthesizing a function abs that produces the
                 absolute value of an integer. The problem can be speciﬁed with the constraint below:
                 (set-logic LIA)
                 (synth-fun abs ((x Int)) Int)
                 (declare-var x Int)
                 (constraint (>= (abs x) 0))
                 (constraint (or (= x (abs x)) (or (= (- x) (abs x)))))
                 (check-synth)
                     Note that the deﬁnition of the unknown function abs does not include a grammar this time, but
                 because the problem is deﬁned in the theory of linear integer arithmetic (LIA), the default grammar
                 consists of all the operations available in the theory.
                 1.3   Invariant Synthesis Track
                 One of the main applications of SyGuS is invariant synthesis. For this problem, the goal is to discover
                 an invariant that makes the veriﬁcation condition for a given loop valid. Such a problem can be easily
                 encoded in SyGuS, but invariant synthesis problems have structure that some solution algorithms are
                 able to exploit and that can be lost when encoding it into SyGuS. Like the 2015 competition, the 2016
                 competitionalsoincludedaseparatetrackforinvariantsynthesisproblemswheretheadditionalstructure
                 is made apparent. In the invariant synthesis version of the SyGuS format, the constraints are separated
                 into pre-condition, post-condition and transition relation, and the grammar for the unknown invariant is
                 assumed to be the same as that for the conditional linear arithmetic track. We illustrate this format with
                 an example from last year’s report [7].
                 Example Forexample,considerthefollowing simple loop.
                 Pre: i >= 0     and    j=j0 and i=i0;
                 while(i > 0){
                      i = i - 1;
                      j = j + 1;
                 }
                 Post: j = j0 + i0;
                 Suppose we want to prove that the value of j at the end of the loop equals the value of i + j at the
                 beginning of the loop. The veriﬁcation condition for this loop would check that (a) the precondition
                 implies the invariant, (b) that the invariant is inductive, so if it holds before an iteration and the loop
                 condition is true, then it will hold after that iteration, and (c) that the invariant together with the negation
                 of the loop condition implies the postcondition. All of these constraints can be expressed in the standard
                 SyGuSformat, but they can be expressed more concisely using the extensions explicitly deﬁned for this
                 purpose. Speciﬁcally, the encoding will be as follows.
                 (set-logic LIA)
                 (synth-inv inv-f ((i Int) (j Int) (i0 Int) (j0 Int)))
                 (declare-primed-var i0 Int)
                 (declare-primed-var j0 Int)
                 182                                                    SyGuS-Comp2016: Results and Analysis
                 (declare-primed-var i      Int)
                 (declare-primed-var j      Int)
                 (define-fun pre-f ((i Int) (j Int) (i0 Int) (j0 Int)) Bool
                                      (and (>= i 0) (and (= i i0) (= j j0))))
                 (define-fun trans-f ((i Int) (j Int) (i0 Int) (j0 Int)
                                          (i! Int) (j! Int) (i0! Int) (j0! Int)) Bool
                                          (and (and (= i! (- i 1)) (= j! (+ j 1)))
                                               (and (= i0! i0) (= j0! j0))))
                 (define-fun post-f ((i Int) (j Int) (i0 Int) (j0 Int)) Bool
                                       (= j (+ j0 i0)))
                 (inv-constraint inv-f pre-f trans-f post-f)
                 (check-synth)
                    The directive (declare-primed-var i) is equivalent to separately declaring i and i!, where the
                 primed version of the variables is used to distinguish their value before and after the loop body. Just like
                 in the earlier example, the function to be synthesized inv_f does not include a grammar, so the entire
                 LIA grammar is assumed. The constraint inv-constraint is syntactic sugar for the full veriﬁcation
                 condition involving the invariant, precondition, postcondition and transition function.
                 1.4  ProgrammingByExampleTrack
                 There has been a lot of recent interest in the synthesis community for learning programs from examples.
                 Programming By Examples (PBE) systems have been developed for many domains including string
                 transformations [13, 14, 28], data structure manipulations [29, 30], interactive parser synthesis [17],
                 higher-order functional programs over recursive data types [21, 10], and program refactorings [23]. The
                 2016competitionincludedanewseparatetrackforProgrammingbyExamples. Thegrammarforbench-
                 marks in this track is speciﬁed using a context-free grammar similar to the general SyGuS track, but the

                 The ﬁrst SyGuS competition, SyGuS-Comp’14 consisted of a single track — the general track — in
                 which the benchmark provides the grammar describing the desired syntactic restrictions for that bench-
                 mark. The background theory could be either linear interger arithmetic or bitvectors. Five solvers com-
                 peted in SyGuS-Comp’14. The solver who won the ﬁrst place was the ENUMERATIVE solver which
                 solved 126 out of 241 benchmarks.

                benchmarks, new solver strategies, and the results of the competition on different benchmark categories.
                2    Competition Settings
                2.1   Participating Benchmarks
                In addition to last year’s competition benchmarks, we had 858 new benchmarks for the Programming
                ByExample(PBE)track. For other tracks, we had the same benchmarks as of last year: General Track
                (309), CLIA Track (73), and Invariant Synthesis Track (67).
                    ThebenchmarksinthePBEtrackcanbeclassiﬁedintotwocategories:
                    • String Transformations: The 108 string transformation tasks are taken from public benchmarks
                      of FlashFill [13, 14] and BlinkFill [28]. The transformations are deﬁned using a Domain-speciﬁc
                      language of string transformations that involve concatenation of substrings of input strings and
                      constant strings, where the substring expressions involve learning positions corresponding to kth
                      occurrence of a constant string in the inputs.
                    • Bitvector Transformations: The 450 bitvector transformation benchmarks were obtained from
                                                            2
                      the 2013 ICFP Programming Competition [1]. The programs for the benchmarks were sam-
                      pled from a bitvector DSL using a strategy of construction k-nuggets (programs of size k that
                      are minimal) and then composing them to generate larger programs. An additional 300 bitvector
                      benchmarks using the same grammar were submitted by Arjun Radhakrishna.
                String Benchmarks    The string benchmarks were taken from the public string transformation bench-
                marksinFlashFill and BlinkFill. These benchmarks correspond to common data cleaning tasks faced by
                spreadsheet users. The hypothesis space of possible transformations is deﬁned by a DSL that is expres-
                sive enough to encode majority of common tasks but at the same time amenable for efﬁcient learning.
                Asubset of the DSL that was encoded in SyGuS benchmark is shown in Figure 1. Note that the SyGuS
                grammar for these benchmarks currently does not contain loops (Kleene star) and regular expression
                based position expressions.
                    The grammar at the top-level consists of string concatenation (str.++) expressions involving con-
                stant strings and substring expressions. The constant strings needed for each benchmark are also pro-
                vided in each benchmark (c1, c2, etc.). For some of the string transformation benchmarks, we created
                two additional class of benchmarks with the sufﬁx -long and -repeat. The -long benchmarks had
                100 input-output examples, whereas the -repeat benchmarks consisted of several input-output exam-
                ples that were repeated in the constraint. The goal of these additional benchmark categories was to see

                 how increasing the number of examples affects the solver performance, and if solving algorithms can
                 avoid reasoning about repeated input-output examples.
                 Bitvector Benchmarks     Thebitvector benchmarks were taken from the 2013 ICFP programming con-
                 test and the DSL encoded as a SyGuS grammar for the benchmarks is shown in Figure 2. Similar to
                 the string transformation DSL, the constants needed for the desired transformation are provided in the
                 grammar.
                     The benchmarks for this category were generated from the DSL by ﬁrst sampling k-nuggest from
                 the DSL and then composing them to obtain larger programs. A k-nugget is a program expression in
                 the DSL of size k such that no other expression in the DSL of size less than k is equivalent with it. The
                 idea in using the k-nuggets for program generation is that the composed programs would lead to more
                 challenging programs that will be less likely to be solved by synthesizing a small equivalent program in
                 the DSL.
                 2.2   Participating Solvers
                 In addition to 7 solvers from last year’s competition, we had two new solver submissions for the 2016
                 competition: i) CVC4 1.5.1 and ii) EUSolver. Table 2 summarizes which solver participated in which
                 track. The two new solvers participated in all 4 tracks. A total of 6 solvers participated in the General
                 track, 5 in the invariant synthesis track, and 5 in the Conditional Linear arithmetic track. Figure 2 lists
                 the submitted solvers together with their authors.
                     The CVC4-1.5.1 solver employs a refutation-based synthesis approach [24]. Instead of solving an
                 exists-forall synthesis formula, it ﬁrst negates the formula to obtain a forall-exists problem and tries to
                 show it is unsatisﬁable. It eliminates the forall quantiﬁcation over unknown function in two ways: i)
                 if the function is always called with the same parameters in the formula, it skolemizes it with a ﬁrst-

              formula, it uses a syntax-guided approach for restricting the space of functions using the grammar. This
              year’s submission had new improvements in both of these two ways. For the single invocation case, the
              solver has a termination guarantee for LIA and supports newer ways to recognize when a property can be
              rewritten as single invocation. For the syntax-guided case, it supports an improved symmetry breaking
              and adds optimizations for unfolding of evaluation functions. For the invariant track, it ﬁxes templates
              for unknown invariants to improve scalability of the solving algorithm.

                 consisted of two 4-core 2.4GHz Intel processors with 256GB RAM and a 1TB hard drive. The memory
                 usage limit of each solver run was set to 128GB. The wallclock time unit was set to 3600 seconds (thus,
                 a solver that used all cores could consume at most 14400 seconds cpu time).
                     Thesolution that the solvers produce are being checked for both syntactic and semantic correctness.
                 That is, a ﬁrst post-processor checks that the produced expression adheres to the grammar speciﬁed in
                 the given benchmark, and if this check passes, a second post-processor checks that the solution adheres
                 to semantic constraints given in the benchmark (by invoking an SMT solver).

                 percentages of benchmarks solved by the solvers for each category. We can observe that the EUSOLVER
                 solves the highest percentage of benchmarks in the combined tracks, whereas the CVC4-1.5.1 solver
                 solves the second most percentage of benchmarks.
                     The primary criterion for winning a track was the number of benchmarks solved, but we also an-
                 alyzed the time to solve and the the size of the generated expressions. Both where classiﬁed using a
                 pseudo-logarithmic scale as follows. For time to solve the scale is [0,1), [1,3), [3,10), [10,30),[30, 100),
                 [100,300), [300, 1000), [1000,3600), >3600. That is the ﬁrst “bucket” refers to termination in less than

                 scale we used is [1,10), [10,30), [30,100), [100,300), [300,1000), >1000 where expression size is the

                 by a solver (meaning the number of benchmark that solver was the single solver that managed to solve
                 them).

                                       CVC4-1.5 solved 179 benchmarks. The EUSOLVER solved 59 benchmarks uniquely and CVC4-1.5.1

                                       solver solved all 73 benchmarks in this category, whereas the EUSOLVER solved 72 out of the 73 bench-

                                       is shown in Figure 5 on the bottom right. Unlike other tracks, we see a dramatic difference in the
                                       performance of the solvers for the benchmarks in the PBE track. The EUSOLVER remarkably solves
                                       787 benchmarks out of 858 (742 out of 745 in the bit-vectors category and 45 out of 108 in the strings
                                       category), whereas the second best solver CVC4-1.5.1 solves 39 benchmarks (21 in the bit-vectors
                                       category and 18 in the strings category). No other solver solved more than 1 problem in this track.

                                           The EUSOLVER solved 751 benchmarks uniquely (720 in the bit-vectors category and 31 in the strings
                                           category), and CVC4-1.5.1 solved 4 benchmarks uniquely (all in the strings category).
                                           3.2           Detailed Results
                                           In the following section we show the results of the competition from the benchmark’s perspective. For a
                                           given benchmark we would like to know: how many solvers solved it, what is the min and max time to
                                           solve, what are the min and max size of the expressions produced, which solver solved the benchmark
                                           the fastest, and which solver produced the smallest expression.

                                           Fig. 6 at the top presents details of the compiler optimization benchmarks. The black bars show the range
                                           of the time to solve among the different solvers in pseudo logarithmic scale (as indicated on the upper
                                           part of the y-axis). Inspect for instance benchmark qm_choose_01.sl. The black bar indicates that the
                                           fastest solver to solve it used less than 1 second, and the slowest used between 100 to 300 seconds. The
                                           black number above the black bar indicates the exact number of seconds (ﬂoor-rounded to the nearest
                                           second) it took the slowest solver to solve a benchmark (and ∞ if at least one solver exceeded the time
                                           bound). Thus, we can see that the slowest solver to solve qm_choose_01.sl took 199 seconds to solve
                                           it.     The white number at the lower part of the bar indicates the time of the fastest solver to solve that
                                           benchmark. Thus, we can see that the fastest solver to solve qm_choose_01.sl required less than 1
                                           second to do so. The colored squares/rectangles next to the lower part of the black bar, indicate which
                                           solvers were the fastest to solve that benchmark (according to the solvers’ legend at the top). Here,
                                           fastest means in the same logarithmic scale as the absolute fastest solver. For instance, we can see that
                                           ENUMERATIVE, STOCHASTIC, and EUSOLVER were the fastest to solve qm_choose_01.sl, solving
                                           it in less than a second and that among the 2 solvers that solved MPwoL_d5s3.sl only ENUMERATIVE

                 solved it in less than 3 seconds.
                     Similarly, the gray bars indicate the range of expression sizes in pseudo logarithmic scales (as in-
                 dicated on the lower part of the y-axis), where the size of an expression is determined by the number
                 of nodes in its parse tree. The black number at the bottom of the gray bar indicates the exact size ex-
                 pression of the largest solution (or ∞ if it exceeded 1000), and the white number at the top of the gray
                 bar indicates the exact size expression of the smallest solution. The colored squares/rectangles next to
                 the upper part of the gray bar indicates which solvers (according to the legend) produced the smallest
                 expression (where smallest means in the same logarithmic scale as the absolute smallest expression). For
                 instance, for qm_choose_01.sl the smallest expression produced had size 7, and 4 solvers out of the 5
                 whosolvedit managed to produce an expression of size less than 10.
                     Finally, at the top of the ﬁgure above each benchmark there is a number indicating the number of
                 solvers that solved that benchmark. For instance, one solver solved qm_max3.sl, two solvers solved
                 qm_neg2.sl,threesolverssolvedqm_loop2.sl,andnosolversolvedqm_max4.slortwolets10.sl.
                 Note that the reason twolest10.sl has 20 as the lower time bound, is that that is the time to terminate
                 rather than the time to solve. Thus, one of the solvers has terminated within 20 seconds, but either it did
                 not produce a result, or it produced an incorrect result. When no solver produced a correct result, there
                 will be no colored squares/rectangles next to the lower parts of the bars.
                 3.3   Observations
                 Analyzing the results of the general track per category (see Figure 13), along the number of benchmarks
                 solved, the number of benchmarks solved uniquely and the number of benchmarks solved among the
                 fastest, we can see that each category of the general track has a clear winner:
                     • CVC4-1.5.1 won4categories: Arrays, Let & Motion Planning, Hackers’ Delight and Integers.
                     • ENUMERATIVE won 3 categories: Compiler-Optimizations, Invariant Generation and Invariant
                       Generation with unbounded integers.
                     • EUSOLVERwon3categories: Multiple Functions and ICFP.
                 If we disregard the partition to categories we can make the following observations:
                     • EUSOLVERsolvedmorebenchmarksofthegeneraltrackthanallothersolvers
                          – EUSOLVERsolved206/309,
                          – CVC4-1.5.1 solved 195/306, and
                          – ENUMERATIVEsolved139/309.
                     • In terms of time to solve, CVC4-1.5.1 solved more benchmarks among the fastest
                          – CVC4-1.5.1 solved 157 among fastest,
                          – EUSOLVERsolved123amongfastest,and

                     With regard to expression sizes, we see that in average CVC4-1.5.1 and EUSOLVER generate large
                 expressions. The average expression size for CVC4-1.5.1 is 31580.5 and for EUSOLVER it is 30595.7
                 whereas the average sizes of ENUMERATIVE, SKETCH-AC and STOCHASTIC are between 11.9 to 17.1.
                 This comparison is not particularly fair, since both CVC4-1.5.1 and EUSOLVER solved more bench-
                 marks in general, so that might be the reason. For this reason we give the exact size expression per
                 benchmark in the detailed evaluation ﬁgures (Figs. 6 to 9). Looking at these ﬁgures we can see that in
                 many instances where the benchmark was solved by both CVC4-1.5.1 and EUSOLVER, the size of the
                 expression generated by EUSOLVER was in a smaller bucket according to our pseudo-logarithmic scale,
                 see for instance the array_search* benchmarks and the fg_max* benchmarks.

                                Wepresent a few interesting dimensions in which the SyGuS competition has evolved over the past 3
                                years. The timeline for the tracks and the solvers submitted for each competition is shown in Figure 14.
                                Theﬁrst competition in 2014 had a single General track, and 5 solvers competed in the competition that
                                included enumerative, stochastic, symbolic, and machine learning-based synthesis algorithms. The sec-
                                ond competition introduced two new tracks: conditional linear integer arithmetic track and the invariant
                                synthesis track. There were 7 new solver submissions that implemented SMT-based quantiﬁer instantia-
                                tion, adaptive concretization of unknowns, BDD-based symbolic algorithms, and geometric optimization
                                based synthesis algorithms. In the 2016 competition, we introduced another new track, the PBE track,
                                and two new solvers EUSOLVER and CVC4-1.5.1 participated in the competition.
                                      The percentage of benchmarks in the General track solved by the solvers participating in the ﬁrst
                                competitionascomparedtothesolversinthethirdcompetitionisshowninFigure15. Aswecanobserve,
                                a much higher fraction of benchmarks are solved by solvers in the third competition as compared to the
                                solvers from the ﬁrst competition. The successful and challenging classes of benchmarks from each
                                competition is shown in Figure 16. We can observe that many of the challenging benchmarks from the
                                previous competition are tackled by the solvers in the newer competition.
