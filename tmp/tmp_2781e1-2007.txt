                         The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been thought to serve as an ‘executive’ that controls the
                         selection of actions and cognitive functions more generally. However, the mechanistic basis of this
                         executive function has not been clearly speciﬁed often amounting to a homunculus. This paper

                         prefrontal areas to support more abstract executive functions. We have developed a computational
