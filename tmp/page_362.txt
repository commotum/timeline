ters, testing features, imaginal inversioning (either of the given in-
verted character or of a hypothesized upright character). This sys-
tem will chunk and it will exhibit a power law, just as Kolers' data
illustrate.

In a series of notable studies, Kolers established a number of
interesting regularities about transfer and retention of the inverted-
reading skill (comparing performance up to a year later). There was
some general transfer—people got to be better readers of inverted
text—but there was mostly highly specific transfer—they would
read exactly the same line of inverted text faster one year later
(with no known intervening relevant activity). It can be seen that
Soar will show the same effects, at least qualitatively. Chunks are
constructed at all parts of this task. Some parts are relatively con-
text free, such as the skill of dealing with the individual inverted
letters. These will transfer to reading any inverted text. But chunks
are also built up for the specific words and even for sequences of
words—for quick and for quick brown. How high these chunks go
on a single reading cannot be determined at this level of analysis.
But, because the task is difficult, some fragments of it are processed
more than once (just as occurs in normal reading, as shown by
regressive eye movements). Repeated processing provides addi-
tional opportunity for higher-level chunks to build up. Further-
more, the Soar model of long-term memory does not include any
true forgetting, so it would exhibit these skills even a year later, as
long as the higher context allowed the problem spaces to be in-
voked. (This latter qualification brings with it many interesting is-
sues, but not ones that Soar is yet prepared to shed light on, one
way or the other.)

Besides providing one more example of Soar’s explanation of
skill acquisition, the discussion of these studies is useful because
Kolers interpreted them to support a view of skill that was very
different from the one extant in psychology. He saw skill as em-
bodied completely in the procedures people built up. Furthermore,
he quite specifically concluded from this work that production sys-
tems and the physical symbol system hypothesis (which he took
production systems to epitomize) were an inadequate formulation
of human behavior—not just a little inadequate, but radically so
(Kolers & Roediger, 1984; Kolers & Smythe, 1984). Hence, it is
interesting that production systems, and learning systems that take
them as the unit of learning, explain Kolers’ results.
