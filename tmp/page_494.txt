prior modes of response must be seen to be inadequate and must be
replaced by better behavior.

Third, chunks are, by their nature, specialized. If Soar uses rep-
resentations that make it attend to odd details, then it will build
chunks that incorporate these details in their conditions. These
chunks will not be evoked, even in apparently equivalent situa-
tions. This is a version of the general point about the minimal trans-
fer of skill learning. From the standpoint of development, speciali-
zation means that a system can be learning all the time but that most
of the learning is encapsulated, so to speak, so that nothing happens
developmentally. It takes a long time before a child stumbles across
the right way of learning a particular competence and is finally able
to transfer that knowledge to a new situation. This hypothesis is
consistent with how experimenters finally attain success in making
development occur deliberately, namely, by arranging learning situ-
ations very carefully and focusing them strongly.

This third reason also reinforces the first, namely, that if learning
is relatively narrow in its transfer characteristics, then from the
child’s point of view, the world seems like a very large collection of
places, each of which requires its own quota of learning time. If, on
the other hand, transfer were generally high, then the world would
be a much smaller place learning-wise, and more time would be
available for learning each part of it.

These remarks are simply speculative hypotheses about why de-
velopment might take a long time. Such speculation is suitable,
given that our aspiration in this chapter along the frontier is only to
make plausible that a unified theory of cognition (here Soar) will be
able to approach realms of behavior that are far from the theory’s
core. This ability has been amply demonstrated here. In fact, we
have actually gone somewhat further—suggesting a viable idea for
a developmental transition mechanism—in an era when transition
mechanisms are in short supply, despite the centrality of such
mechanisms for developmental theory and the recognized need for
them.

8.3. The Biological Band

For two points along Soar’s frontier-——language and development—
we have been bold enough to indicate strong vectors for how Soar
might approach them. For other points we must be satisfied with
