show up. Linguistics has many well-established grammatical regu-
larities that hold across a given language in terms of highly abstract
classifications (and apply uniformly to all human languages). This
seems to contrast with the word-centered comprehension-operator
scheme, where each operator is a separate entity. How will this
scheme be able to exhibit these regularities? No definitive answer
can be given, of course, but certain things can be noted.

First, whether language-wide regularities emerge in the compre-
hension-operator scheme depends on how the operators are struc-
tured internally. If sets of operators corresponding to significant
classes of words have common processes, then they will exhibit
regularities. The form of comprehension operators does not pre-
clude system-wide regularities.

Second, even granting this first point, the regularities will be
embodied extremely redundantly, with structure duplicated in
every operator. This may strike some as simply too improbable a
way for it to be, for a single regularity would seem to imply a locus
for that regularity within the system. Such a reaction is based on an
architectural intuition, however, and one that is misplaced for expe-
riential learning systems, such as Soar. If we view Soar as a living
system, we assume it will acquire structure from each experience
throughout its waking life, amounting to ~10° chunks per year. The
architecture is technologically structured to accommodate this pro-
cess of accumulation throughout the lifespan. Thus, very large
amounts of structure can be expected to be devoted to any domain,
such as language, that occupies substantial fractions of life. Fur-
ther, this structure will be immensely redundant, because experi-
ence is immensely redundant. It is to be expected that the same
knowledge will be encoded redundantly in many places, though
with variations due to the variation of experience.

Third, the source of the regularity must be learning. Soar's
chunking is like a pipe that transmits knowledge encoded in some
problem spaces into other problem spaces. Suppose, to adopt one
obvious arrangement, that whenever a comprehension operator im-
passes, a common space is used to engage in the problem-solving
activities to successfully employ the operator. The common struc-
ture of this space, as embodied in its operators and state representa-
tion, will get transferred into the specific operators. If this space
reflects the appropriate linguistic regularities, then these regular-
ities will show up in the individual comprehension operators.
