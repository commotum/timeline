fact, doing so is a necessary part of being prepared—that the per-
son knows exactly what to do and only must execute the task. We
might have put 7 as the initial function to be performed, rather than
after C. In general, however, the task to be attempted is evoked by
what is comprehended about the environmental situation, so it
seemed better to indicate the general situation and not imply that
the task is always set ahead of time. In any case, T will not show up
in any critical-time paths and it effectively drops out of the analysis,
even though it is an essential function for accomplishing a complete
task.

Intend is the function of committing to a response. There must be
such a function or there will not be a response from the person,
though there might be behavior of the person's body. The intention
is not the response itself, which is produced by the motor subsys-
tem, Instead, it is the issuance of a command to the motor system
that commits the system to a particular response. With the success-
ful completion of an intention, expressed as an encoded command
in working memory, contro! escapes from central cognition. Con-
trol can possibly be regained, if enough time elapses before the
motor system passes beyond the point of no return and suitable
abortion or modification commands are possible, hence can them-
selves be intended. But such control is a new task and problem,
distinct from the original intention.

Intending is performed by an operator. It determines which ex-
ternal action to take and issues the motor command to working
memory. With suitable preparation it may be very simple and hence
short. It can also expand indefinitely if there are difficulties in deter-
mining what response should be made. However, it must always
occur, for it is the point where behavior is controlled.

Decoding, like encoding, is an obligatory function, consisting of a
sequence of productions. Decoding of the command occurs auton-
omously, outside the contro! of central cognition. Its duration in-
creases with the complexity of the motor command and can be
influenced by preparation.

Motor behavior is the function of actually affecting the external
world—clearly necessary for accomplishing a task. Like percep-
tion, its duration is not controlled by central cognition. It is intrinsic
to the motion required and not penetrable by cognition. If we think
in terms of a composed dynamic system, however, its operation
may be quite complex and may last a relatively long time, compared
