194 = Unified Theories of Cognition

a larger system that includes perception and motor behavior. We
will call it the foral cognitive system, not wishing to oppose cogni-
tion to perception and motor behavior. We need to describe this
structure as well, for it is critical to a unified theory of cognition.
Not even a simple stimulus-response arc can be treated without
including perception, cognition, and motor behavior.

The treatment, at this point, of the total cognitive system will be
brief and superficial. We need to keep our attention focused on
central cognition, to understand it thoroughly. Thus, after embed-
ding central cognition in the total system, we will immediately turn
back for the rest of this chapter to illustrating and exploring the
central mechanisms. The total cognitive system will get more atten-
tion again in Chapter 5, when we consider the complete arc from
stimulus to response. Even then, however, the treatment will be
limited. Operationally, Soar is still largely focused on central cogni-
tion. This is one respect in which Soar provides an imperfect exem-
plar for a unified theory of cognition, which demands a complete
treatment of all parts of the mind.

The treatment of the total cognitive system will thus be largely
theoretical and not backed up in detail by an operational Soar sys-
tem. It is important to recognize both sides of this coin. On the one
hand, a unified theory of cognition is a theory-——a body of knowl-
edge about the nature of the human mind. As with theories gener-
ally, it need only exist in written form as assertions about the mind.
Thus, the sketch of the complete cognitive system below and in
Chapter 5 is perfectly legitimate, and a certain amount of any
unified theory of cognition will exist only in declarative form. On
the other hand, for a system as complex as the mind, it is difficult to
have much faith in a theory without having it instantiated in some
operational form. This will be especially difficult as unification in-
creases, making the relation of disparate aspects important. Conse-
quently, though throughout the book I will continually put forth
theoretical tendrils that extend beyond the operational core of Soar
or modify it in various ways, I will always do so with a certain
amount of diffidence and uncertainty about the nature of the theo-
retical ideas themselves (even apart from the relation of these ideas
to the empirical phenomena they purport to explain).

Figure 4-15 shows the total cognitive system. We return to the
view of Chapter 2 (Figure 2-1), that the mind is a controller of a
dynamic system interacting with a dynamic external environment
