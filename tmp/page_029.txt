16 # Unified Theories of Cognitian

unhesitatingly included. So should language. Yet I demur from
simply adding it to the list in its proper station, so to speak. Too
much is known about language, especially from nonpsychological
sources: phonology, syntax, semantics, and discourse (actually
somewhat less about the latter). Language should be approached
with caution and circumspection. A unified theory of cognition
must deal with it, but I will take it as something to be approached
later rather than sooner.

Motivation and emotion? And there are other things as well, such
as imagining, dreaming, daydreaming, hallucinating .. . could not
bring myself to add to the list: development, social behavior, per-
sonality structure, and on through the rest of psychology’s standard
chapters. By this time, it’s clear that we are discussing a fantasy.
Clearly, I can’t mean a theory of all that! A unified theory of cogni-
tion is just a fantasy.

What to do? Perhaps a retreat to clichés is in order: The best is
the enemy of the good. (Though if one must resort to cliché, Vol-
taire is not a bad choice for a source.) We cannot face the entire list
all at once. So let us consider it to be a priority list, and work our
way down from the top. What I will mean by a unified theory of
cognition is a cognitive theory that gets significantly further down
the list cumulatively than we have ever done before. If someone
keeps asking how the unified theory explains dreaming or how it
describes personality, i will simply point back to this list. It is right
to ask, but wrong to insist.

A unified theory of cognition does not mean a high-level theory
that gains its unification because it backs off to vagueness and
piatitudes. Calculations and simulations count. The examples given
earlier in the chapter are meant seriously, although they each touch
only a single aspect of human behavior and are not yet unified. We
don't want a contemporary version of what has come to be called
“the grand theories of the 1930s.”

A unified theory will unify our existing understanding of cogni-
tion. It will not be a brand-new theory that replaces current work at
every turn. Rather, it will put together and synthesize what we
know. On the other hand, it can't be just a pastische, in which
disparate formulations are strung together with some sort of con-
ceptual baling wire. Its parts must work together. Nor can it be
what have come to be called frameworks, which are conceptual
structures (often computer systems) that are reputed to be rela-
