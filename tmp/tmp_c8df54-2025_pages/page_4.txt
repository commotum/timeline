        183    Figure 3. Reflection System - execution on two ARC evaluation tasks. Initially, multiple solvers make independent predictions on the
        184    task. Then, the task and the prediction are presented to the reflection model, which chooses the correct final prediction. In the example,
        185    solver 1 is based on program synthesis (DSL Search) and solver 2 is an LLM (Claude 3 Opus). The reflection model is an LLM (GPT-4o).
        186    Both task flows are actual demonstrations of how the Reflection System performs on ARC evaluation tasks. In both cases, the Reflection
        187    System produces a correct final solution.
