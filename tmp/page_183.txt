but it is of the simplest sort. There are no default values, no at-
tached procedures, and no automatic inheritance structures. It has
none of the apparatus that would exist if the representation were
extended in a framelike direction.

4.1.4, Accumulation of Preferences for Decisions
As Figure 4-2 indicated, the architecture of Soar is built around the
problem space. Thus, the decisions that must be made are what
problem space should be used (to attain a goal), what state should
be used (within the problem space), and, finally, what operator
should be used (to progress to the next state). These are basic
operations of the architecture. They are atl made by a uniform
decision process, called the decision cycle. This is shown in Figure
4-5 (which shows three consecutive cycles). Each decision cycle
has an elaboration phase followed by a decision procedure. The
elaboration phase acquires the knowledge that is available about
the current situation. Alt productions whose conditions are satisfied
freely add new working-memory elements (the vertical arrows).
There is no conflict resolution, so anything is free to flow in. This js
a gathering operation, to pull everything in. Elements that arrive
early may be used to access additional elements. The elements can
be of any sort—about the blocks or tables or the relations between
them, about what operators can move what blocks, about what
block was moved in the past, and about what future arrangements
of blocks are expected or desired. More abstractly stated, an intelli-
gent system must be able to express its knowledge of situations and
actions over the past, present, and future.

An intelligent system must also be able to express its knowledge
