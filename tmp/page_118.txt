gence. The early Al programs had very little knowledge—not more
than a dozen rules of domain knowledge. They did a modest
amount of search, with trees of 100 to 1,000 nodes. That is the
period that is often dubbed the search Period of AI. Then came the
awareness that lots of knowledge could be used—in what is called
an expert system or a rule-based system. Expert systems can be
seen as an exploration of what can be attained with very little
reasoning or deliberation but with all the effort being put into ac-
cessing immediately available knowledge. Typical current expert
systems are in the region of hundreds of rules of knowledge and
only tens of situations explored deliberately. The biggest expert
systems range up to about 5,000 rules and don't do much additional
search.

Humans can be located on this same figure. If we consider expert
behavior on a relatively narrow task, we find that tens of thousands
of chunks of information are involved (Simon & Gilmartin, 1973).
Humans do more search than current expert systems do, but only in
the hundreds of situations, not in the many thousands. Of course, a
