structure of data chunking that the reconstructed memory is open
to modulation, distortion, error, and default composition.

Second, the recognition test is reminiscent of the sort of im-
mediate familiarity tests that show up in some dual-process psycho-
logical modeis of retrieval, epitomized by the model of Atkinson
and Juola (1973). These models posit an immediate test of familiar-
ity, which takes constant time no matter how many items have been
presented from which the test item must be discriminated. If famil-
iarity is strong enough, there is an immediate decision that the test
item has been seen; if familiarity is weak enough, there is an im-
mediate decision that the item has not previously been seen. Only if
familiarity is in-between is a detailed search of memory done.
(These models bear a strong similarity to the random-walk decision
models we looked at briefly in Chapter 1; see Figure 1-11.) The
recognition test in Soar, which always has to be there, is playing
exactly this role. It is, of course, a nongraded version. The more
interesting point is that it occurs here because it is part of the
technical solution, not because it is posited for psychological pur-
poses.

Third, the mechanisms that have emerged in Soar are exceed-
ingly close to the mechanisms in the Epam theory of verbal learning
(Feigenbaum & Simon, 1984; Simon & Feigenbaum, 1964), a theory
embodied in a simulation program that goes back to the early years
of the cognitive revolution (Feigenbaum, 1959). This similarity is
important enough to explore in some detail. The top of Figure 6-15
shows the main features of Epam.’ Epam learns verbal items by
growing a network of discriminations—so an item (BAJ) can be
discriminated from distractors. Each node has an associated test,
which sorts the incoming item toward a terminal node. If an item is
sorted down to a terminal node that contains other items, then it
conflicts with them and the network is extended by creating some
new test that discriminates the items. Epam handles paired as-
sociates by embedding the stimulus and response in a single struc-
ture (BAJ-GID), which is just the way Soar encodes the paired-
associate task.

The Epam theory predicts a number of results in verbal Jearning,
as listed in the figure, adapted from Feigenbaum and Simon (1984),

7. The version to be described is Epam [ll the most mature version (Simon &
Feigenbaum, 1964).
