Symbolic Processing for Intetligence = 223

abstract symbol structure independent of the domain it purports to
describe. It needs to be completed by a set of identifications, and
there may be many ways in which such identifications might occur.
Indeed, the long-standing practice in cognition has been generally
to treat theories of cognition as relatively autonomous with respect
to their neural realization. In any event, describing Soar as a dis-
tinct system with AI roots creates the need for an identification of
the features of the Soar architecture with those of the human cogni-
tive architecture.

Given the development so far, it should simply be an exercise for
the reader to say exactly how the mapping goes. For indeed, it can
go only one way. The four levels of cognition, as laid out in Figure
3-9, provide the target. Given the structure of Soar as described in
this chapter, we are then forced into the mapping shown in Figure
4-23. We need to keep distinct the terms from the analysis of the
human cognitive architecture and those from Soar, even where the
same words are used; hence, I will prefix some terms and phrases
with Soar when necessary—for example, Soar long-term memory
vs. (human) long-term memory.

Productions correspond to symbol structures. Matching the pro-
ductions to the elements in Soar’s working memory corresponds to
the process of accessing distal structure. Thus, the production sys-
tem forms the recognition system, at the bottom of the cognitive
levet, and hence all of long-term memory. The operation is totally
parallel at this level, as reflected in there being no conflict resolu-
tion for the production system. Action is involuntary and there is no
awareness of individual firings.

It follows that the duration of a production cycle (matching and
executing one or more productions in parallel} takes place at the
~~10 ms level. We need to be mindful that ~~10 ms is a highly
approximate quantity, which might be as fast as 3 to 4 ms and as
slow as 30 to 40 ms (see Figure 3-10). Part of this large variability
stems simply from the time constants not having been pinned down
against detailed data of human behavior, but much variability will
remain, both between humans and within an individual human over
time and occasion. Within the individual, the variability can arise
from multiple sources: tasks, component subsystems, long-lived
internal states, or momentary state.

It is unclear what factors should determine the duration of a
production cycle. We could simply assume this to be the bottom
