                 1. Arithmetic and Counting Tasks
                 Wecreated fine-grained arithmetic and counting datasets that emphasized precise numerical operations and pattern
                 recognition. These datasets were designed to strengthen the model’s capability in handling discrete mathematical
                 operations commonly found in ARC tasks.
                 2. Multimodal Grid Translation
