               Preprint: Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater: How and why deep learning for ARC
               A.4  Recent Additions
               In early 2024, we integrated data from RE-ARC [68], which provided procedurally generated examples for the 400
               ARCtrainingtasks. This addition contributed to improved performance through increased exposure to task-specific
               patterns and transformations.
               A.5  Training System Notes
               The training system utilizes prepared datasets in chunks for roughly 500,000 training examples. The chunks are
               needed to reduce CPU memory usage for processing. The order of the training examples is shuffled. It automatically
               incorporates new datasets without interrupting training and some datasets include instruction-following and chat-based
               interaction capabilities.
