Figure 18.12 Location of cortical damage in brains with removals of (A) lateral, (B) posterior, or (C) medial
striate cortex. The lesions are mapped on lateral and medial surface views and on representative cross-
sections through a standard rhesus monkey brain. Cross-sections are at levels indicated by vertical lines on
surface views. Dashed lines indicate extent of striate cortex on cross-sections but borders of striate cortex on

surface views; anterior limit of striate cortex within the calcarine fissure is indicated on medial surface views
by dashed arrow. Removal of striate cortex is shown in crosshatch; black arrows on the medial surface views
indicate removal of striate tissue from within the banks and depths of the calcarine fissure. Damage to
prestriate tissue is shown in stripes. For abbreviations see figure 18.3.
