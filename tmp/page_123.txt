on, but the figure is sufficient to reflect our interest in systems that
can support mind-like capabilities.

The two comet-shaped regions indicate the systems that support
adaptation with respect to the external world. The larger class are
the representational systems, which are systems whose internal
structure obeys representation laws. Such laws support adapta-
tion.” Within the class of representational systems are the knowl-
edge-level systems, which are so structured that their behavior can
be derived just from the content of the representations about the
world and their goals. There are many representational systems
that cannot be described at the knowledge-level.

Representational systems must be realized in some structure, so
the two comet-shaped regions intersect the four types of system
structures. Representational systems with substantial scopes for
domains and goals require symbol systems for their realization, but
as scope diminishes then structures of lesser capability can be used
as well. The areas of intersection with these more general system
structures become smaller and smaller, indicating their more spe-
cialized character. There are of course many structures of each
type that do not satisfy representation laws, hence are not about the
external world, and hence do not support active adaptation.

25. [did not discuss systems that support adaptation but are not representational.
They would be another outer layer of the adaptational class of systems. The obvious
candidates would be open-loop adaptations, such as those constructed by evolution and
human designers. Examples would be a bird's wing or a wheel.
