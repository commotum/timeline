a best preference for the attention operator, which will then be
selected at the next decision cycle. This is an interesting example of
a tiny change to the architecture (the ability to create a specific
preference) that provides an important function, namely, interrup-
tion. It has two minor but interesting properties. First, the inter-
ruption does not occur instantly, it must wait until it is selected by
the decision procedure when that executes next. Thus, there are
variable delays in responding to the interruption. Second, the inter-
ruption need not be taken. Given a best preference, nothing can be
taken over it, but if another best preference occurs then a tie im-
passe emerges and Soar is given the option of deciding.

When we turn to the nature of human motor action we find our-
selves in an unsatisfactory state. The starting point for the exten-
sion of a unified theory of cognition into motor behavior is the
interface between central cognition and the motor system. Cogni-
tive intention produces a command to release motor action. But
what is the language of commands that cognition uses to send mes-
sages to the motor system? Knowing that would be enough to get
started. The command language structures the way the motor sys-
tems appear to cognition, and thus it determines cognition’s tasks.

Unfortunately, the nature of the command language to the motor
system is exactly where obscurity is deepest. Much is known about
the motor system, both in behavioral and neural terms (Brooks,
1986; Stelmach, 1976, 1978; Stelmach & Requin, 1980; Kelso, 1977;
Schmidt, 1982). The field has moved from a simple point-response,
so to speak, to motor programs, and to elaborations of these, such
as hierarchical programs (Rosenbaum, 1988). But nowhere is there
any real clue about the language of the programs—only that it
exists, or can appear linear or hierarchical under suitable tasks.
Some experiments have attempted to determine directly whether
the language of commands includes time, force, final position, or
firing rates. These experiments are aimed in the right direction, but
as yet they yield no integration. Their results can perhaps be sum-
marized by saying that all the above are used, though in various
not-well-understood situations and occasions.

D-productions might seem to offer a way out. They decode from
some high-level motor-command language down to primitive com-
mands. Thus, so goes this hope, one can adopt whatever motor-
command language one wishes and simply stipulate that this will be
converted into some unknown, but certifiably primitive, commands
