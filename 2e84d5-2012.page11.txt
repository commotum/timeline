                 Distinct (laminar-speciﬁc) extrinsic connections (Zeki and Shipp,             Forward connections convey prediction error (from superﬁcial
                 1988; Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Barone et al., 2000; Vezoli et al.,       pyramidal cells) and backward connections convey predictions (from

                 Feedback extrinsic connections are inhibitory (Murphy and Sillito,            Top-downpredictions suppress or counter prediction errors
