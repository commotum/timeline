               Preprint: Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater: How and why deep learning for ARC
               This dataset focused on simple shapes and their precise positions, creating a bridge between visual and symbolic
               reasoning.
               3. Extended PCFGDataset
               Following work on neural networks’ compositional capabilities [69] and the demonstrated effectiveness of Probabilistic
               Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) for pattern learning [4], we significantly expanded our PCFG dataset to include:
                    1. 100 distinct string operations with few-shot examples
                    2. Tasks structured similarly to ARC riddles
                    3. Program synthesis components requiring function name generation
               These tasks were generally designed to be more challenging than typical ARC problems, pushing the boundaries of
               abstract reasoning capabilities.
               4. Multi-Task Integration Dataset
               Wecreated a synthetic multi-task dataset that combined multiple problem types within single training examples:
                    1. Arithmetic code generation
                    2. Chained boolean expression evaluation
                    3. PCFGtasks
               Thedataset was structured in JSON format, with both prompts and answers carefully formatted for consistency.
               5. Cellular Automata and Mathematical Patterns
               Weincorporated additional pattern-generation approaches:
                    1. Cellular automata tasks within the ARC framework
                    2. ARCriddle boards generated using mathematical equations
                    3. Pattern complexity variations to induce diverse priors
                    4. Cross-item riddles requiring learning underlying concepts across multiple examples
                    5. Repair-type riddles for inducing priors including symmetries, shapes, progression, and counting
               See Figure 7 for examples of synthetic ARC-style riddles used in pre-training.
               A.3  DataSourcesandGeneration
               Weincorporated several data sources and generation approaches:
                    1. Framework-GeneratedData:
                        (a) ARC_gymframework[67]togeneratesupplementary training examples with:

                           ii. Controlled out-of-distribution task generation
                           iii. Variable numbers of primitives per task
                           iv. Systematic composition of basic operations
