                                   indices in subsets and the rearrangement of voxel matrices are particularly time
                                   consuming, accounting for        24% of the total backbone latency, as shown in
                                   Figure 5. To alleviate this unnecessary computational overhead from window
                                   shifting, we introduce the Cross-Window Interaction (CWI) module, which em-
                                   ploys convolutions with large kernel to blend voxel features across windows.
                                       We adhere to the design principles of the Inception architecture [42], where
                                   theinputfeaturesaredividedalongthechanneldimensionandprocessedthrough
                                   multiple branches using group-wise convolutions. Instead of employing a single
                                   large kernel for convolution, we adopt more efÏcient 1D kernels along different
                                   axes for feature aggregation. Specifically, we apply a (Sh+1)×1×1 convolution
                                   in one branch and a 1×(S +1)×1convolutioninanotherbranch,where(S ,S )

                                   denotes the window size. Additionally, we incorporate a standard 3×3×3 con-
                                   volution in one branch to enhance locality, while another branch performs an
                                   identity mapping. Given input X of channel 4c, the output X′ of the Cross
                                   Window Interaction module can be written as:
                                                            X′ =Concat(X ,X ,X ,X3c:4c),                                 (4)
