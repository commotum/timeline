equations again, although a far simpler set than the one
which governs individual molecular motions.

In any real hydrodynamical system, viscous dissipa-
tion is always occurring, unless the system is moving as
a solid, and thermal dissipation is always occurring,
unless the system is at constant temperature. Vor cer-
tain purposes many systems may be treated as conserva-
tive systems, in which the total energy, or some other
quantity, does not vary with time. In seeking the ulti-
mate behavior of a system, the use of conservative
equations is unsatisfactory, since the ultimate value of
any conservative quantity would then have to equal the
arbitrarily chosen initial value. This difficulty may be
obviated by including the dissipative processes, thereby
making the equations nonconservative, and also includ-
ing external mechanical or thermal forcing, thus pre-
venting the system from ultimately reaching a state of
rest. If the system is to be deterministic, the forcing
functions, if not constant with time, must themselves
vary according to some deterministic rule.

In this work, then, we shall deal specifically with
finite systems of deterministic ordinary differential
equations, designed to represent forced dissipative
hydrodynamical systems. We shall study the properties
of nonperiodic solutions of these equations.

It is not obvious that such solutions can exist at all.
Indeed, in dissipative systems governed by finite sets of
linear equations, a constant forcing leads ultimately to
a constant response, while a periodic forcing leads to a
petiodic response, Hence, nonperiodic flow has some-
times been regarded as the result of nonperiodic or
random forcing.

The reasoning leading to these concludions is not
applicable when the governing equations are nonlinear.
If the equations contain terms representing advection—
the transport of some property of a fluid by the motion
of the fluid itself—a constant forcing can lead to a
variable response. In the rotating-basin experiments
already mentioned, both periodic and nonperiodic flow
result from thermal forcing which, within the limits of
experimental control, is constant. Exact periodic solu-
tions of simplified systems of equations, representing
dissipative flow with constant thermal forcing, have
been obtained analytically by the writer (1962a). The
writer (1962b) has also found nonperiodic solutions of
similar systems of cquations by numerical means.

2. Phase space

Consider a system whose state may be described by If
variables X1, +--, Xac. Let the system be governed by
the set of equations

dX,fdt=FAX1:--Xap, t=1,-°-,M, (1)
where time é is the single independent variable, and the
functions F; possess continuous first partial derivatives.
Such a system may be studied by means of phase space—

an M-dimensional Euclidean space T whose coordinates
are Xq, ---, Xay. Each point in phase space represents a
possible instantaneous state of the system. A state
which is varying in accordance with (1) is represented
by a moving particle in phase space, traveling along a
irajectory in phase space. For completeness, the position
of a stationary particle, representing a steady state, is
included as a trajectory.

Phase space has been a useful concept in treating
finite systems, and has been used by such mathema-
ticians as Gibbs (1902) in his development of statistical
mechanics, Poincaré (1881) in his treatment of the solu-
tions of differential equations, and Birkhoff (1927) in
his treatise on dynamical systems,

From the theory of differential equations (e,g., Ford
1933, ch. 6), it follows, since the partial derivatives
oF,/aX, are continuous, that if fo is any time, and if
X10, -*-X yo is any point in T, equations (1) possess a
unique solution

X= fi{X1y+++ Xaof), t=1, +--+, M, (2)

valid throughout some time interval containing fo, and
satisfying the condition

FlXr0,°+ Xatuto) =X, tel, +, Me. (3)
The functions f, are continuous in X10, +--, Xaro and
Hence there is a unique trajectory through each point of
T. Two or more trajectories may, however, approach the
same point or the same curve asymptotically as {—> 2
or as i» —«, Moreover, since the functions f; are
continuous, the passage of time defines a continuous
deformation of any region of I' into another region.

In the familiar case of a conservative system, where
some positive definite quantity Q, which may represent
some form of energy, is invariant with time, each tra-
jectory is confined to one or another of the surfaces of
constant Q. These surfaces may take the form of closed
concentric shells.

Tf, on the other hand, there is dissipation and forcing,
and if, whenever Q equals or exceeds some fixed value
Oy, the dissipation acts to diminish Q more rapidly then
the forcing can increase (), then (—dQ/d!) has a positive
lower bound where Q2(Q,, and each trajectory must
ultimately become trapped in the region where Q<Q1.
Trajectories representing forced dissipative flow may
therefore differ considerably from those representing
conservative flow.

Forced dissipative systems of this sort are typified
by the system
