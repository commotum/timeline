ABSTRACT

Finite systems of deterministic ordinary nonlinear differential equations may be designed to represent
forced dissipative hydrodynamic flow. Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in.
phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily
unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into consider-
ably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions.

A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found
to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic.

The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.

1. Introduction

Certain hydrodynamical systems exhibit steady-state
flow patterns, while others oscillate in a regular periodic
fashion. Still others vary in an irregular, seemingly
haphazard manner, and, even when observed for long
periods of time, do not appear to repeat their previous
history.

These modes of behavior may all be observed in the
familiar rotating-basin experiments, described by Fultz,
et al. (1959) and Hide (1958). In these experiments, a
cylindrical vessel containing water is rotated about its
axis, and is heated near its rim and cooled near its center
in a steady symmetrical fashion. Under certain condi-
tions the resulting flow is as symmetric and steady as the
heating which gives rise to it. Under different conditions
a system of regularly spaced waves develops, and pro-
gresses at a uniform speed without changing its shape.
Under still different conditions an irregular flow pattern
forms, and moves and changes its shape in an irregular
nonperiodic manner.

Lack of periodicity is very common in natural sys-
tems, and is one of the distinguishing features of turbu-
lent flow. Because instantaneous turbulent flow patterns
are so irregular, attention is often confined to the sta-
tistics of turbulence, which, in contrast to the details of
turbulence, often behave in a regular well-organized
manner. The short-range weather forecaster, however,
is forced willy-nilly to predict the details of the large-
scale turbulent eddies—the cyclones and anticyclones—
which continually arrange themselves into new patterns.

Thus there are occasions when more than the statistics
of irregular flow are of very real concern.

In this study we shall work with systems of deter-
ministic equations which are idealizations of hydro-
dynamical systems. We shall be interested principally in
nonperiodic solutions, ie., solutions which never repeat
their past history exactly, and where all approximate
repetitions are of finite duration. Thus we shall be in-
volved with the ultimate behavior of the solutions, as
opposed to the transient behavior associated with
arbitrary initial conditions.

A closed hydrodynamical system of finite mass may
ostensibly be treated mathematically as a finite collec-
tion of molecules—usually a very large finite collection
—in which case the governing laws are expressible as a
finite set of ordinary differential equations. These equa-
tions are generally highly intractable, and the set of
molecules is usually approximated by a continuous dis-
tribution of mass. The governing laws are then expressed
as a set of partial differential equations, containing such
quantities as velocity, density, and pressure as de-
pendent variables.

It is sometimes possible to obtain particular solutions
of these equations analytically, especially when the
solutions are periodic or invariant with time, and, in-
deed, much work has been devoted te obtaining such
solutions by one scheme or another. Ordinarily, how-
ever, nonperiodic solutions cannot readily be deter-
mined except by numerical procedures. Such procedures
involve replacing the continuous variables by a new
finite set of functions of time, which may perhaps be the
values of the continuous variables at a chosen grid of
points, or the coefficients in the expansions of these
variables in series of orthogonal functions. The govern-
ing laws then become a finite set of ordinary differential
