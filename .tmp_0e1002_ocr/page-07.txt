puting machine. Approximately one second per itera-
tion, aside from output time, is required.

For initial conditions we have chosen a slight de-
parture from the state of no convection, namely (0,1,0).
‘Table 1 bas been prepared by the computer. It gives the
values of .V (the number of iterations), X, Y, and Z at
every fifth iteration for the first 160 iterations. In the
printed output (but not in the computations) the values
of X, ¥, and Z are multiplied by ten, and then only
those figures to the left of the decimal point are printed.
Thus the states of steady convection would appear as
0084, 0084, 0270 and —0084, —0084, 0270, while the
state of no convection would appear as 0000, 0000, 0000.
The initial instability of the state of rest is evident. All
three variables grow rapidly, as the sinking cold fluid
is replaced by even colder fluid from above, and the
rising warm fluid by warmer fluid from below, so that by
step 35 the strength of the convection far exceeds that
of steady convection, Then Y diminishes as the warm
fluid is carried over the top of the convective cells, so
that by step 50, when X and Y have opposite signs,
warm fluid is descending and cold fluid is ascending. The
motion thereupon ceases and reverses its direction, as
indicated by the negative values of X following step 60.
By step 85 the system has reached a state not far from
that of steady convection. Between steps 85 and 150 it
executes a complete oscillation in its intensity, the
slight amplification being almost indetectable.

The subsequent behavior of the system is illustrated
in Tig. 1, which shows the behavior of ¥ for the first
3000 iterations. After reaching its carly peak near step
35 and then approaching equilibrium near step 85, it
undergoes systematic amplified oscillations until near
step 1650, At this point a critical state is reached, and
thereafter Y changes sign at seemingly irregular inter-
vals, reaching sometimes one, sometimes two, and some-
times three or more extremes of one sign before changing
sign again.

Fig. 2 shows the projections on the X-Y- and F-Z-
planes in phase space of the portion of the trajectory
corresponding to iterations 1400-1900, The states of
steady convection are denoted by C and C’. The first
portion of the trajectory spirals outward from the
vicinity of C’, as the oscillations about the state of
eady convection, which have been occurring since step
5, continue to grow. Eventually, near step 1650, it
rosses the X-Z-plane, and is then deflected toward the
eighborhood of C. It temporarily spirals about C, but
rosses the X-Z-plane after one circuit, and returns to
@ neighborhood of C’, where it soon joins the spiral
over which it has previously traveled. Thereafter it
crosses from one spiral to the other at irregular intervals.

Fig. 3, in which the coordinates are F and Z, is based
upon the printed values of X, Y, and Z at every fifth
iteration for the first. 6000 iterations. These values deter-
mine X as a smooth single-valued function of ¥ and Z
over much of the range of Y and Z; they determine X
