Fic. 3. Isopleths of X as a function of ¥Y and Z (thin solid curves), and isopleths of the lower of two
values of X’, whcre two values occur (dashed curves), for approximate surfaces formed by all points on
limiting trajectories. Heavy solid curve, and extensions as dotted curves, indicate natural boundaries of

surfaces.

as one of two smooth single-valued functions over the
remainder of the range. In Fig, 3 the thin solid lines are
isopleths of X, and where two values of X exist, the
dashed lines are isopleths of the lower value. Thus,
within the limits of accuracy of the printed values, the
trajectory is confined to a pair of surfaces which appear
to merge in the lower portion of Fig. 3, The spiral about
C lies in the upper surface, while the spiral about C’ lies
in the lower surface. Thus it is possible for the trajectory
to pass back and forth from one spiral to the other
without intersecting itself.

Additional numerical solutions indicate that other
trajectories, originating at points well removed from
these surfaces, soon meet these surfaces. The surfaces
therefore appear to be composed of all points lying on
limiting trajectories.

Because the origin represents a steady state, no tra-
jectory can pass through it. However, two trajectories
emanate from it, ie., approach it asymptotically as
7 —, The heavy solid curve in Fig. 3, and its ex-
tensions as dotted curves, are formed by these two tra-
jectories. Trajectories passing close to the origin will
tend to follow the heavy curve, but will not cross it, so
that the heavy curve forms a natural boundary to the
region which a trajectory can ultimately occupy. The

holes near C and C’ also represent regions which cannot
be occupied after they have once been abandoned.

Returning to Fig, 2, we find that the trajectory ap-
parently leaves one spiral only after exceeding some
critical distance from the center. Moreover, the extent
to which this distance is exceeded appears to determine
the point at which the next spiral is entered; this in turn
seems to determine the number of circuits to be executed
before changing spirals again.

It therefore seems that some single feature of given
circuit should predict the same feature of the following
circuit. A suitable feature of this sort is the maximum
value of Z, which occurs when a circuit is nearly com-
pleted. Table 2 has again been prepared by the com-
puter, and shows the values of X, Y, and Z at only those
iterations V for which Z has a relative maximum. The
succession of circuits about C and C’ is indicated by the
succession of positive and negative values of X and Y.
Evidently X and ¥ change signs following 4 maximum
which exceeds some critical value printed as about 385.

Fig. 4 has been prepared from Table 2. The abscissa
is M,, the value of the zth maximum of Z, while the
ordinate is M41, the valuc of the following maximum.
Each point represents a pair of successive values of 7
taken from Table 2. Within the limits of the round-off
