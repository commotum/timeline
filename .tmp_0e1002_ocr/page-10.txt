M, if k>O, so that no repetitions occur. These se-
ucnces, which form a nondenumerable set, may con-
ceivably approach periodic sequences asymptotically
and be quasi-periodic, or they may be nonperiodic.
Finally, consider two sequences My, Mi, and
My’, My’, +++, where Mo'=Mo+e. Then for a given &,
if ¢ is sufficiently small, Mf,’=My-2*e, All sequences
are therefore unstable with respect to small modifica-
tions. In particular, all periodic sequences are unstable,
and no other sequences can approach them asymptoti-
cally. All sequences except a set of measure zero are
therefore nonperiodic, and correspond to nonperiodic
trajectories, .

Returning to Fig, 4, we see that periodic sequences
analogous to those tabulated above can be found. They
are given approximately by

The trajectories possessing these or other periodic se-
quences of maxima are presumably periodic or quasi-
periodic themselves.

The above sequences are temporarily approached in
the numerical solution by sequences beginning at itera-
tions 5340, 4881, 3625, and 3926. Since the numerical
solution eventually departs from each of these se-
uences, each is presumably unstable.

More generally, if M,’= Mf,+¢, and if eis sufficiently
small, M ups’=MasetAe, where A is the product of the
slopes of the curve in Fig. 4 at the points whose abscissas
are Mn, +>, Mnyx-1. Since the curve apparently has a
slope whose magnitude exceeds unity everywhere, all
sequences of maxima, and hence all trajectories, are
unstable. In particular, the periodic trajectories, whose
sequences of maxima form a denumerable set, are un-
stable, and only exceptional trajectories, having the
same sequences of maxima, can approach them asymp-
totically. The remaining trajectories, whose sequences
of maxima form a nondenumerable set, therefore repre-
sent deterministic nonperiodic flow.

These conclusions have been based upon a finite seg-
ment of a numerically determined solution. They cannot
be regarded as mathematically proven, even though the
evidence for them is strong. One apparent contradiction
requires further examination.

Tt is difficult to reconcile the merging of two surfaces,
one containing each spiral, with the inability of two
trajectories to merge. It is not difficult, however, to
explain the apparent merging of the surfaces. At twa
times 75 and 71, the volumes occupied by a specified set
of particles satisfy the relation

Vola) = eet ot i Vary), (37)

according to (30). A typical circuit about C or C’ re-
quires about 70 iterations, so that, for such a circuit,

te=71+0.7, and, since ¢+8+1=41/3,
Vo(r1) =0.00007 V(r). (38)

Two particles separated from each other in a suitable
direction can therefore come together very rapidly, and
appear to merge.

It would. seem, then, that the two surfaces mercly
appear to merge, and remain distinct surfaces, Following
these surfaces along a path parallel to a trajectory, and
circling C or C’, we see that each surface is really a pair
of surfaces, so that, where they appear to merge, there
are really four surfaces. Continuing this process for
another circuit, we see that there are really eight sur-
faces, etc., and we finally conclude that there is an
infinite complex of surfaces, each extremely close to one
or the other of two merging surfaces.

The infinite set of values at which a line parallel to the
X-axis intersects these surfaces may be likened to the
set of all numbers between zcro and one whose decimal
expansions (or some other expansions besides binary)
contain only zeros and ones. This set is plainly non-
denumerable, in view of its correspondence to the set of
all numbers between zero and one, expressed in binary.
Nevertheless it forms a set of measure zero. The se-
quence of ones and zeros corresponding to a particular
surface contains a history of the trajectories lying in that
surface, a one or zero immediately to the right of the
decimal point indicating that the last circuit was about
C or C’, respectively, a one or zero in second place
giving the same information about the next to the last
circuit, etc. Repeating decimal expansions represent
periodic or quasi-periodic trajectories, and, since they
define rational fractions, they form a denumerable set.

If one first visualizes this infinite complex of surfaces,
it should not be difficult to picture nonperiodic deter-
ministic trajectories embedded in these surfaces.

8. Conclusion

Certain mechanically or thermally forced noncon-
servative hydrodynamical systems may exhibit either
periodic or irregular behavior when there is no obviously
related periodicity or irregularity in the forcing process.
Both periodic and nonpcriodic flow are observed in some
experimental models when the forcing process is held
constant, within the limits of experimental control.
Some finite systems of ordinary differential equations
designed to represent these hydrodynamical systems
possess periodic analytic solutions when the forcing is
strictly constant. Other such systems have yielded non-
periodic numerical solutions.

A finite system of ordinary differential equations
representing forced dissipative flow often has the prop-
erty that all of its solutions are ultimately confined
within the same bounds. We have studied in detail the
properties of solutions of systems of this sort. Our
principal results concern the instability of nonperiodic
solutions. A nonperiodic solution with no transient com-
