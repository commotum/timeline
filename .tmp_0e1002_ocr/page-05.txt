Marcu 1963

substituting these series into (17) and (18). He arranged
the right-hand sides of the resulting equations in double-
Fourier-series form, by replacing products of trigono-
metric functions of # (or 2) by sums of trigonometric
functions, and then equated coefficients of similar func-
tions of x and z, He then reduced the resulting infinite
system to a finite system by omitting reference to all
but a specified finite set of functions of i, in the manner
proposed by the writer (1960).

He then obtained time-dependent solutions by nu-
merical integration. In certain cases all except three of
the dependent variables eventually tended to zero, and
these three variables underwent irregular, apparently
nonperiodic fluctuations.

These same solutions would have been obtained if the
series had at the start been truncated to include a total
of three terms. Accordingly, in this study we shall let

a(l+a%)"k- y= Xv2 sin (raH—x) sin (nH—2), (23)
wRoOR,AT—8= Yv2 cos (naH—x) sin (rH~12)
—Z sin (2rH~'z), (24)

where X, Y, and Z are functions of time alone. When
expressions (23) and (24) are substituted into (17) and
(18), and trigonometric terms other than those occurring
in (23) and (24) are omitted, we obtain the equations

x= ~ocX+eY, (25)
Yr=—XZ+#X—Y, (26)
Z= XY —bZ, (27)

Here a dot denotes a derivative with respect to the
dimensionless time r=a*H~*(1-+-@?)xt, while o= «7 is
the Prandil number, r=Ro'R,, and b=4(1+-22)-.
Except for multiplicative constants, our variables X, Y,
and Z are the same as Saltzman’s variables A, D, and
G. Equations (25), (26), and (27) are the convection
equations whose solutions we shall study.

Tn these equations X is proportional to the intensity
of the convective motion, while Y is proportional to the
temperature difference between the ascending and de-
scending currents, similar signs of X and Y denoting
that warm fluid is rising and cold fluid is descending.
The variable Z is proportional to the distortion of the
vertical temperature profile from linearity, a positive
value indicating that the strongest gradients occur near
the boundaries.

Equations (25)-(27) may give realistic results when
the Rayleigh number is slightly supercritical, but their
solutions cannot be expected to resemble those of (17)
and (18) when strong convection occurs, in view of the
extreme truncation.

6. Applications of linear theory

Although equations (25)-(27), as they stand, do not
have the form of (4), a number of linear transformations

will convert them to this form. One of the simplest of
these is the transformation

NX, V'xV, Z=LZ—-r—a.

(28)

Solutions of (25)-(27) therefore remain bounded within
aregion R as + — ©, and the general results of Sections
2, 3 and 4 apply to these equations.

The stability of a solution X(r), ¥(7), 2(7) may be
formally investigated by considering the behavior of
small superposed perturbations zo(7), yo(r), o(r). Such
perturbations are temporarily governed by the linear-
ized equations

xoT -o a 0 Xo
[>| = Ke —1 “|| (29)
%o. ¥ xX —b Zo.

Since the coefficients in (29) vary with time, unless
the basic state X, Y, Z is a steady-state solution of
(25)~(27), a general solution of (29) is not feasible.
However, the variation of the volume V) of a small
region in phase space, as each point in the region is
displaced in accordance with (25)-(27), is determined
by the diagonal sum of the matrix of coefficients;
specifically

Ve=—(+O+-DV a (30)

This is perhaps most readily seen by visualizing the
motion in phase space as the flow of a fluid, whose
divergence is

ax: OF az
sat or +b 1). (31)
aX aY a4

Hence each small volume shrinks to zero as 7 + 2, at
a vate independent of X, Y, and Z. This does not imply
that each small volume shrinks to a point; it may simply
become flattened into a surface. It follows that the
volume of the region initially enclosed by the surface S
shrinks to zero at this same rate, so that all trajectories
ultimately become confined to a specific subspace
having zero volume. This subspace contains all those
trajectories which lie entirely within R, and so contains
all central trajectories.

Equations (25)~(27) possess the steady-state solution
X=Y=Z=0, representing the state of no convection.
With this basic solution, the characteristic equation of
the matrix in (29) is

[A+OIDIN-E (+ DA+-o(1—r)]=0. (32)

This equation has three real roots when r>0; all are
negative when 7<1, but one is positive when r> 1. The
criterion for the onset of convection is therefore r=1,
or R,=R,, in agreement with Rayleigh’s result.

When r> 1, equations (25)-(27) possess two additional
steady-state solutions X=V¥=4Vbr—D, Z=r—1.
