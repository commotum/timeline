A convenient scheme for automatic computation is the
successive evaluation of Xanan, Xiceng2y), aNd Xengr
according to (9), (10) and (14). We have used this
procedure in all the computations described in this
study.

In phase space a numerical solution of (1) must be
represented by a jumping particle rather than a con-
tinuously moving particle. Moreover, if a digital com-
puter is instructed to represent each number in its
memory by a preassigned fixed number of bits, only
certain discrete points in phase space will ever be oc-
cupied. If the numerical solution is bounded, repetitions
must eventually occur, so that, strictly speaking, every
numerical solution is periodic. In practice this considera-
tion may be disregarded, if the number of different
possible states is far greater than the number of itera-
tions ever likely to be performed. The necessity for
repetition could be avoided altogether by the somewhat
uneconomical procedure of letting the precision of
computation increase as ” increases.

Consider now numerical solutions of equations (4),
obtained by the forward-difference procedure (11). For
such solutions,

Quis Ont (€0/d)nAt+3 L FFP a)AP. (15)

Let S’ be any surface of constant Q whose interior R’
contains the ellipsoid Z where dQ/di vanishes, and let
S be any surface of constant @ whose interior R con-
tains S’.

Since D F? and dQ/dé both possess upper bounds in
R’, we may choose Af so small that Pn41 lies in R if
P, lies in R’. Likewise, since 3° F? possesses an upper
bound and dQ/di possesses a negative upper bound in
R-~R’, we may choose At so small that Qnyia<@n if Pu
lies in R—R’. Hence At may be chosen so small that any
jumping particle which has entered R remains trapped
within R, and the numerical solution does not blow up.
A blow-up may still occur, however, if initially the
particle is exterior to R.

Consider now the double-approximation procedure
(14). The previous arguments imply not only that
Paty lies within R if P, lies within R, but also that
P qat2y) lies within R if Penyi) lies within R. Since the
region & is convex, it follows that P,.+1, as given by (14),
lies within R if P,, lies within R. Hence if Af is chosen so
small that the forward-difference procedure does not
blow up, the double-approximation procedure also does
not blow up.

We note in passing that if we apply the forward-
difference procedure to a conservative system where
dQ/di=0 everywhere,

totically approaching a steady state. A similar result
holds when the double-approximation procedure (14) is
applied to a conservative system.

5. The convection equations of Saltzman

In this section we ‘shall introduce a system of three
ordinary differential equations whose solutions afford
the simplest example of deterministic nonperiodic flow
of which the writer is aware. The system is a simplifica-
tion of one derived by Saltzman (1962) to study finite-
amplitude convection. Although our present interest. is
in the nonperiodic nature of its solutions, rather than
in its contributions to the convection problem, we shall
describe its physical background brietly.

Rayleigh (1916) studied the flow occurring in a layer
of fluid of uniform depth H, when the temperature
difference between the upper and lower surfaces is
maintained at a constant value AT. Such a system
possesses a steady-state solution in which there is no
motion, and the temperature varies linearly with depth,
If this solution is unstable, convection should develop.

In the case where all motions are parallel to the
x~—~z-plane, and no variations in the direction of the
y-axis occur, the governing equations may be written
(see Saltzman, 1962)

F) ay,v a0
Vey Ve) be Valt go—, (17)
ot O(a,2) ax
os -a(Y0)_ AT ay

Here ¥ is a stream function for the two-dimensional
motion, @ is the departure of ternperature from that
occurring in the state of no convection, and the con-
stants g, ow, v, and x denote, respectively, the acceleration
of gravity, the coefficient of thermal expansion, the
kinematic viscosity, and the thermal conductivity. The
problem is most tractable when both the upper and
lower boundaries are taken to be free, in which case
y¥ and V’p vanish at both boundaries.
Rayleigh found that fields of motion of the form

v= sin (weH~'x) sin (rH), (19)
d= 6, cos (raH—'x) sin (nH—2), (20)

would develop if the quantity

The minimum value of R,, namely 272'/4, occurs
when a?=4,.

Saltzman (1962) derived a set of ordinary differential
equations by expanding y and @ in double Fourier series
in x and z, with functions of ¢ alone for coefficients, and
