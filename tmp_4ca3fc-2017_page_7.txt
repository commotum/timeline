                         the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum
                         path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.
                         Asingle convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output
                         positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,
                         or O(log (n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths
                                 k
                         between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than
                         recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity
                         considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable
                         convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,
                         the approach we take in our model.

                         5   Training
                         This section describes the training regime for our models.
                         5.1  Training Data and Batching
                         Wetrained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million
                         sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-
                         target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT
                         2014English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece
                         vocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training
                         batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000
                         target tokens.
                         5.2  HardwareandSchedule
                         Wetrained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using
                         the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We
                         trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the
                         bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps
                         (3.5 days).
                         5.3  Optimizer
                                                                                          −9
                         WeusedtheAdamoptimizer[17]withβ = 0.9,β = 0.98and = 10            . We varied the learning
                                                              1        2
                         rate over the course of training, according to the formula:
                                              −0.5                −0.5                           −1.5
                                     lrate = dmodel · min(step_num    , step_num·warmup_steps        )          (3)
                         This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_steps training steps,
                         and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used
                         warmup_steps = 4000.

                         positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of
