                     The AI assistant’s ability to engage in a productive dialogue is often enhanced by its use of
                     counter-questions, particularly when dealing with incomplete or vague queries. The assistant’s
                     performance should be assessed based on its ability to recognize when a rhetorical question is
                     necessary and to use it effectively to clarify the ‘Human’s intent. The evaluation criteria are as
                     follows:
                     1.   Assess whether the question posed by ‘Human’ contains ambiguities or lacks specific
                     details that would require the AI assistant to use counter-questions for clarification.
                     2. If the question does require clarification through a counter-question, evaluate how the AI
                     assistant employs this strategy to address the ambiguities or missing information in ‘Human’s
                     query.
                     3. Once ‘Human’ provides the necessary conditions or clarifies the question, evaluate whether the
                     AIassistant offers a true and detailed response that fully addresses the clarified query.
                     Scoring Guidelines:
                     - 1-3 points:    The AI assistant fails to identify the need for a rhetorical question when
                     necessary, or it employs rhetorical questions ineffectively, leading to answers that do not align
                     with ‘Human’s query, or lack the detail required to fully clarify the question.
                     - 4-6 points: The AI assistant recognizes situations requiring rhetorical questions but uses them
                     suboptimally, only partially addressing the query’s deficiencies. Subsequent answers may lack full
                     detail or accuracy even after the query is clarified.
                     - 7-9 points: The AI assistant effectively uses rhetorical questions to pinpoint and address the
                     missing or unclear elements in ‘Human’s query, and provides a largely accurate and detailed
                     response to the perfected question.
                     - 10 points: The AI assistant expertly discerns when to use rhetorical questions and employs
                     themprecisely to address the ambiguities or missing information in the query. Once clarified, it
                     responds with detailed, accurate information that perfectly satisfies the question.
                     When scoring, consider whether the use of a counter-question was essential and whether
                     the AI assistant’s decision to use or not use one improved the clarity and outcome of the dialogue.
                     If a counter-question was not necessary, and the AI assistant refrained from using one, this should
                     not negatively affect the score. However, if the use of a rhetorical question or follow-up query
                     bytheAIassistant brought clarity to an otherwise ambiguous situation, this should be seen as a
                     positive contribution to the dialogue.
                     Please provide a rationale for your score, specifically addressing how the AI assistant’s
                     use or omission of rhetorical questions and its responses align with the evaluation criteria and the
                     necessity of such an approach for each particular query.
