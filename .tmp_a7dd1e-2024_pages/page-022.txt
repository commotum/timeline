                     The AI assistant’s understanding of references is essential for maintaining a coherent dialogue.
                     Thefollowing criteria should be used to evaluate its performance:
                     1.   The AI assistant’s response must demonstrate a correct understanding of referential
                     information from questions asked by ‘Human,’ which typically relate to content from the previous
                     dialogue. Ideally, the AI should explicitly acknowledge or clarify these references in its reply.
                     2. The response from the AI assistant should be consistent with the content of the ‘Human’s ques-
                     tion in the current round, providing true and accurate information, free from misunderstandings or
                     inaccuracies related to the references.
                     Scoring Guidelines:
                     - 1-3 points: The AI assistant fails to recognize or correctly interpret the referential infor-
                     mation, leading to responses that are either inaccurate or unrelated to the previous content.
                     - 4-6 points: The AI assistant shows a partial understanding of references, but the response might
                     include some inaccuracies or fail to fully utilize the referential information.
                     - 7-9 points: The AI assistant’s response indicates a good understanding of the references, with
                     only slight inaccuracies or omissions in the connection to the previous dialogue.
                     - 10 points: The AI assistant demonstrates excellent understanding and use of referential
                     information, perfectly aligning its response with the previous content and the current question
                     accurately and precisely.
                     In addition to the score, please provide an explanation that specifically addresses how
                     the AI assistant’s response demonstrates its ability or inability to understand and use referential
                     information in accordance with the criteria above. ‘
