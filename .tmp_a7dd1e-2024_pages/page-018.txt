         Youare required to generate a multi-turn English dialogue to evaluate the model’s capacity for
         self-correction, i.e., whether the model can rectify its incorrect responses. ‘Human’ initiates with a
         question, ‘Assistant’ provides an incorrect answer, ‘Human’ questions the accuracy, and then ‘As-
         sistant’ delivers the correct answer. Please omit labels such as ‘step1’, ‘step2’, etc., from the output.
         Youcanrefer to these examples:
         # Example 1 #
         # Example 2 #
         # Example 3 #

         Youarerequired to generate a multi-turn English dialogue to assess the model’s ability to maintain
         the correctness of its answers, that is, whether the model can stand by its correct responses.
         ‘Human’starts off with a question, ‘Assistant’ responds correctly, ‘Human’ challenges the answer,
         and then ‘Assistant’ reaffirms the accuracy of its original response.
         Youcanrefer to these examples:
         # Example 1 #
         # Example 2 #
         # Example 3 #

         I will give you a reasoning question and the corresponding answer. Please use this question and an-
         swer pair to generate a set of multi-round conversations to test the robot’s multi-round reason-
         ing ability. Try to make inferences in each round based on the dialogue information from the previ-
         ous round.

         # Example 1 #
         # Example 2 #
