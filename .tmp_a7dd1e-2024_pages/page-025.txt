                     TheAIassistant’s capability to resist interference will be measured against these criteria:
                     1.   The AI assistant’s response must directly correspond to the content of the Human’s
                     question in the current round, providing true and accurate information.
                     2. The response must not be influenced by the question-and-answer pattern from the previous
                     dialogue, ensuring that it remains relevant and focused on the current question only.
                     Scoring Guidelines:
                     - 1-3 points:    The AI assistant’s response is largely influenced by previous interactions,
                     fails to address the current question accurately, or provides false information.
                     - 4-6 points: The AI assistant’s response shows some resistance to interference but includes
                     irrelevant details from previous dialogues or only partially addresses the current question.
                     - 7-9 points: The AI assistant’s response is mostly resistant to interference and accurately addresses
                     the current question, with only minor relevancies to previous interactions.
                     - 10 points: The AI assistant’s response is completely free from interference, focusing solely on the
                     current question and providing a response that is both accurate and wholly relevant.
                     Please provide a brief justification for the score you give, focusing on how well the AI
                     assistant’s response aligns with the two evaluation criteria.

                     Weaimtospecifically evaluate the rephrasing ability of the large language model (AI assistant).
                     Thecriteria for evaluation are as follows:
                     1.   The content of the AI assistant’s rephrased response must maintain the same main
                     idea as the Assistant’s response in the first round.
                     2. The rephrased content must comply with the specific rewriting requirements set forth by the
                     Humaninthecurrentround.
                     Scoring Guidelines:
                     - 1-3 points: The rephrased response significantly deviates from the original main idea or
                     fails to meet the rewriting requirements.
                     - 4-6 points: The rephrased response captures the original main idea but only partially meets the
                     rewriting requirements or lacks fluency/coherence.
                     - 7-9 points: The rephrased response maintains the original main idea and satisfies most of the
                     rewriting requirements with minor discrepancies or stylistic issues.
                     - 10 points: The rephrased response perfectly preserves the original main idea and fulfills all of the
                     rewriting requirements set by Human, exhibiting a seamless and natural integration of the required
                     changes.
