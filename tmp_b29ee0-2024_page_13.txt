                                       increasing feature similarity.

                                       ture Propagation (GFP) results in a substantial improvement over the baseline,
                                       as shown in Table 5 (a) (index 2). This underscores our method’s capability to
                                       minimizeinformationloss and reduce noise during the upsampling phase, leading
                                       to higher-quality per-point embeddings.

                                       Fig. 4 qualitatively illustrates the feature responses between a given point and
                                       others in a scene. From left to right, it presents the original scene, baseline
                                       method, and our SegPoint, respectively, with warmer colors indicating closer
                                       feature relationships. The baseline method predominantly highlights spatially
                                       proximate points, often missing important but distant features, such as chair
                                       cushions. In contrast, SegPoint leverages global information, allowing for the
                                       identification of both near and distant relevant features, such as cushions and
                                       casters. This demonstrates our model’s superior ability to capture global context
                                       and recognize intricate structures within the scene.

                                       pensing water during bathing”, SegPoint successfully infers the role of a shower.
                                       In other scenes, the instructions include queries requiring extensive knowledge
                                       of the world and complex reasoning, like “What appliance is used for heating or
                                       cooking food quickly using electromagnetic radiation.” SegPoint can still segment
                                       the microwave oven very well, which shows that SegPoint can make good use of
                                       the reasoning ability of LLM and provide high-quality masks.
