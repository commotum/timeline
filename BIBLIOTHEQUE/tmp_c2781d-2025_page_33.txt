           Figure 12: Autonomous Replanning for Survival. The SFT+RL plan dynamically agent demon-
           strates adaptive behavior by interrupting its current objective to address a critical need. It formulates
           a plan to acquire food when low on health, and upon replenishing, generates a new plan to resume
           gameprogression.
           Figure 13: Autonomous Multi-Stage Tactical Planning. The agent showcases its ability to chain
           plans and adapt its tactics. After initially planning and crafting a stone sword to combat zombies,
           it reassesses and creates a subsequent plan to first gain distance, demonstrating a more strategic
           approach before engaging.
           Figure 14: Agent Failure Case. The agent correctly plans to craft an iron pickaxe, identifying the
           necessary iron and furnace. However, after successfully collecting iron, it fails by attempting the
           craft action without ensuring the furnace is accessible, indicating a lapse in verifying all conditions
           of its plan.
