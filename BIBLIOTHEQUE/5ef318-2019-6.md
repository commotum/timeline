# A Framework for Intelligence and Cortical Function Based on Grid Cells in the Neocortex (2019)
Source: 5ef318-2019.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper proposes a neuroscience framework for how the neocortex functions using grid cells and cortical columns.
- It grounds intelligence in biological brain structures like the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, indicating cross-disciplinary context.

## Evidence extracts
- "Howtheneocortex works is a mystery. In this paper we propose a novel framework for
understanding its function. Grid cells are neurons in the entorhinal cortex that represent
the location of an animal in its environment." (p. 1)
- "FIGURE2|Representing objects as location spaces. We propose that the neocortex learns the structure of objects in the same way that the entorhinal cortex and
hippocampus learn the structure of environments." (p. 4)
