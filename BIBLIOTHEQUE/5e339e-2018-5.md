# The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks (2019)
Source: 5e339e-2018.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces the lottery ticket hypothesis about sparse subnetworks with favorable initializations, focusing on training/optimization principles rather than new architectures or datasets.
- Describes a pruning-and-reset procedure to identify “winning tickets,” emphasizing methodology for training sparse networks.

## Evidence extracts
- "Weﬁndthatastandardpruningtechnique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively." (Abstract)
- "Identifying winning tickets. We identify a winning ticket by training a network and pruning its smallest-magnitude weights." (Section “Identifying winning tickets”)
