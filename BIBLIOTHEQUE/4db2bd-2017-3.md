# DeepCoder: Learning to Write Programs (2017)
Source: 4db2bd-2017.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a learning-guided program synthesis framework where a neural model predicts program attributes from input-output examples to direct search over programs.
- The main contribution is a computation mechanism that augments search-based synthesis with neural guidance rather than a new dataset or encoding scheme.

## Evidence extracts
- "The approach is to train a neural network to predict properties of the program that generated the outputs from the inputs." (p. 1)
- "One of the central ideas of this work is to use a neural network to guide the search for a program consistent with a set of input-output examples instead of directly predicting the entire source code." (p. 5)
