                                 Wepropose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversar-
                                 ial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G
                                 that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates
                                 the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The train-
                                 ing procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This
                                 framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary
                                 functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data
                                 distribution and D equal to 1 everywhere. In the case where G and D are deﬁned

                                 works during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate
                                 the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of
                                 the generated samples.
                         1   Introduction
                         The promise of deep learning is to discover rich, hierarchical models [2] that represent probability
                         distributions over the kinds of data encountered in artiﬁcial intelligence applications, such as natural
                         images, audio waveforms containing speech, and symbols in natural language corpora. So far, the
                         most striking successes in deep learning have involved discriminative models, usually those that
                         mapahigh-dimensional, rich sensory input to a class label [14, 22]. These striking successes have
                         primarily been based on the backpropagation and dropout algorithms, using piecewise linear units
                         [19, 9, 10] which have a particularly well-behaved gradient . Deep generative models have had less
        arXiv:1406.2661v1  [stat.ML]  10 Jun 2014of an impact, due to the difﬁculty of approximating many intractable probabilistic computations that
                         arise in maximum likelihood estimation and related strategies, and due to difﬁculty of leveraging
                         the beneﬁts of piecewise linear units in the generative context. We propose a new generative model
                         estimation procedure that sidesteps these difﬁculties. 1
                         In the proposed adversarial nets framework, the generative model is pitted against an adversary: a
                         discriminative model that learns to determine whether a sample is from the model distribution or the
                         data distribution. The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters,
                         trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is
                         analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Competition in this game drives
                         both teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistiguishable from the genuine

                     This framework can yield speciﬁc training algorithms for many kinds of model and optimization
                     algorithm. In this article, we explore the special case when the generative model generates samples
                     by passing random noise through a multilayer perceptron, and the discriminative model is also a
                     multilayer perceptron. We refer to this special case as adversarial nets. In this case, we can train
                     both models using only the highly successful backpropagation and dropout algorithms [17] and
                     sample from the generative model using only forward propagation. No approximate inference or
                     Markovchains are necessary.

                     An alternative to directed graphical models with latent variables are undirected graphical models
                     with latent variables, such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) [27, 16], deep Boltzmann
                     machines (DBMs) [26] and their numerous variants. The interactions within such models are
                     represented as the product of unnormalized potential functions, normalized by a global summa-
                     tion/integration over all states of the random variables. This quantity (the partition function) and
                     its gradient are intractable for all but the most trivial instances, although they can be estimated by
                     Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Mixing poses a signiﬁcant problem for learning
                     algorithms that rely on MCMC [3, 5].
                     Deep belief networks (DBNs) [16] are hybrid models containing a single undirected layer and sev-
                     eral directed layers. While a fast approximate layer-wise training criterion exists, DBNs incur the
                     computational difﬁculties associated with both undirected and directed models.
                     Alternative criteria that do not approximate or bound the log-likelihood have also been proposed,
                     such as score matching [18] and noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) [13]. Both of these require the
                     learned probability density to be analytically speciﬁed up to a normalization constant. Note that
                     in many interesting generative models with several layers of latent variables (such as DBNs and
                     DBMs),it is not even possible to derive a tractable unnormalized probability density. Some models
                     such as denoising auto-encoders [30] and contractive autoencoders have learning rules very similar
                     to score matching applied to RBMs. In NCE, as in this work, a discriminative training criterion is
                     employedtoﬁtagenerativemodel. However,ratherthanﬁttingaseparatediscriminativemodel, the

                     area includes the generative stochastic network (GSN) framework [5], which extends generalized
                     denoising auto-encoders [4]: both can be seen as deﬁning a parameterized Markov chain, i.e., one
                     learns the parameters of a machine that performs one step of a generative Markov chain. Compared
                     to GSNs, the adversarial nets framework does not require a Markov chain for sampling. Because
                     adversarial nets do not require feedback loops during generation, they are better able to leverage
                     piecewise linear units [19, 9, 10], which improve the performance of backpropagation but have

                     multilayer perceptrons. To learn the generator’s distribution p over data x, we deﬁne a prior on
                                                                     g
                     input noise variables p (z), then represent a mapping to data space as G(z;θ ), where G is a

                     differentiable function represented by a multilayer perceptron with parameters θ . We also deﬁne a

                     second multilayer perceptron D(x;θ ) that outputs a single scalar. D(x) represents the probability

                     that x came from the data rather than p . We train D to maximize the probability of assigning the

                     correct label to both training examples and samples from G. We simultaneously train G to minimize
                     log(1 −D(G(z))):

                                In the next section, we present a theoretical analysis of adversarial nets, essentially showing that
                                the training criterion allows one to recover the data generating distribution as G and D are given
                                enough capacity, i.e., in the non-parametric limit. See Figure 1 for a less formal, more pedagogical
                                explanation of the approach. In practice, we must implement the game using an iterative, numerical
                                approach. Optimizing D to completion in the inner loop of training is computationally prohibitive,
                                andonﬁnitedatasetswouldresultinoverﬁtting. Instead, we alternate between k steps of optimizing
                                Dandonestep of optimizing G. This results in D being maintained near its optimal solution, so
                                long as G changes slowly enough. This strategy is analogous to the way that SML/PCD [31, 29]
                                training maintains samples from a Markov chain from one learning step to the next in order to avoid
                                burning in a Markov chain as part of the inner loop of learning. The procedure is formally presented
                                in Algorithm 1.
                                In practice, equation 1 may not provide sufﬁcient gradient for G to learn well. Early in learning,
                                when G is poor, D can reject samples with high conﬁdence because they are clearly different from
                                the training data. In this case, log(1 − D(G(z))) saturates. Rather than training G to minimize
                                log(1 −D(G(z))) we can train G to maximize logD(G(z)). This objective function results in the

                              Proof. Consider V (G,D) = U(p ,D) as a function of p as done in the above criterion. Note
                                                                    g                          g
                              that U(p ,D) is convex in p . The subderivatives of a supremum of convex functions include the
                                        g                     g
                              derivative of the function at the point where the maximum is attained. In other words, if f(x) =
                              sup       f (x) and f (x) is convex in x for every α, then ∂f (x) ∈ ∂f if β = argsup                  f (x).
                                  α∈A α              α                                           β                            α∈A α
                              This is equivalent to computing a gradient descent update for p at the optimal D given the cor-
                                                                                                     g
                              responding G. sup U(p ,D) is convex in p with a unique global optima as proven in Thm 1,

                              therefore with sufﬁciently small updates of p , p converges to p , concluding the proof.
                                                                               g   g                 x
                              In practice, adversarial nets represent a limited family of p distributions via the function G(z;θ ),
                                                                                              g                                         g
                              and we optimize θ rather than p itself. Using a multilayer perceptron to deﬁne G introduces
                                                   g                g

                              ceptrons in practice suggests that they are a reasonable model to use despite their lack of theoretical
                              guarantees.

                              9] and sigmoid activations, while the discriminator net used maxout [10] activations. Dropout [17]
                              was applied in training the discriminator net. While our theoretical framework permits the use of
                              dropout and other noise at intermediate layers of the generator, we used noise as the input to only
                              the bottommost layer of the generator network.

                        duced in Breuleux et al. [8] and used for various generative models for which the exact likelihood
                        is not tractable [25, 3, 5]. Results are reported in Table 1. This method of estimating the likelihood
                        has somewhat high variance and does not perform well in high dimensional spaces but it is the best

                            chains are never needed, only backprop is used to obtain gradients, no inference is needed during
                            learning, and a wide variety of functions can be incorporated into the model. Table 2 summarizes
                            the comparison of generative adversarial nets with other generative modeling approaches.
                            The aforementioned advantages are primarily computational. Adversarial models may also gain
                            some statistical advantage from the generator network not being updated directly with data exam-
                            ples, but only with gradients ﬂowing through the discriminator. This means that components of the
                            input are not copied directly into the generator’s parameters. Another advantage of adversarial net-
                            works is that they can represent very sharp, even degenerate distributions, while methods based on
                            Markov chains require that the distribution be somewhat blurry in order for the chains to be able to
                            mixbetweenmodes.
                            7    Conclusions and future work
                            This framework admits many straightforward extensions:
                            1. A conditional generative model p(x | c) can be obtained by adding c as input to both G and D.
                            2. Learned approximate inference can be performed by training an auxiliary network to predict z
                               given x. This is similar to the inference net trained by the wake-sleep algorithm [15] but with
                               the advantage that the inference net may be trained for a ﬁxed generator net after the generator
                               net has ﬁnished training.
                                                                              7
                         3. One can approximately model all conditionals p(x   | x ) where S is a subset of the indices
                                                                            S     6S
                            of x by training a family of conditional models that share parameters. Essentially, one can use
                            adversarial nets to implement a stochastic extension of the deterministic MP-DBM [11].
                         4. Semi-supervised learning: features from the discriminator or inference net could improve perfor-
                            manceofclassiﬁers when limited labeled data is available.
                         5. Efﬁciency improvements: training could be accelerated greatly by divising better methods for
                            coordinating G and D or determining better distributions to sample z from during training.
                          This paper has demonstrated the viability of the adversarial modeling framework, suggesting that
                          these research directions could prove useful.
