                                  Here, in the given three demonstration examples of a test task (top panel), it is unclear whether a blue line “touching” (but not “going
                                  through”) a red rectangle should render that rectangle blue. The inference example (bottom panel) involves this situation (“touching”), and
                                  our model attempts to interpret the rule as either “going-through-only” (attempt 1) or “touching” (attempt 2).

                                  structures. Early layers tend to focus on local transformations and context. Middle layers tend to perform a more non-local connection,
