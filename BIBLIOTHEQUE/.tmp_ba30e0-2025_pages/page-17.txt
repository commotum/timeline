        Figure 22. Visualization of the test-time training process. Here, we visualize the grid augmented with a given scale ratio of 2× (the
        full canvas is not shown for brevity). As the test-time training progresses, the model’s predictions gradually converge toward the correct
        output. In early epochs, the model produces coarse and imprecise structures; in later epochs, the model can improve the solutions, e.g.,
        by refining color and spatial arrangement. This visualization illustrates the model’s behavior of adapting to task-specific transformations
        through few-shot test-time training.
