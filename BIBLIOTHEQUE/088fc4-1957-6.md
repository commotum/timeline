# A Markovian Decision Process (1957)
Source: 088fc4-1957.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper frames its main analysis as a dynamic programming process, focusing on asymptotic behavior of recurrence relations in a Markovian decision setting.
- It develops an inspection and replacement policy problem with probabilities and costs, reflecting an operations-research decision process rather than a machine learning model contribution.

## Evidence extracts
- "As we shall discuss below, this question arises from the consideration of a dynamic programming process." (p. 1)
- "The problem is then to determine the inspection and replacement policy which minimizes the expected unit cost of production." (p. 6)
