# The Surprising Effectiveness of Test-Time Training for Few-Shot Learning (2025)
Source: b3df59-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes test-time training as inference-time parameter updates, which is a change in computation rather than a positional or dimensional change.
- Targets improved reasoning and few-shot generalization on challenging tasks via this test-time adaptation mechanism.

## Evidence extracts
- "Test-time training (TTT) enables parametric models to adapt
during inference through dynamic parameter updates in re-
sponse to each test input." (p. 2)
- "In this paper, we investigate how to leverage TTT on top
of standard in-context learning (ICL) to boost performance
on challenging tasks that require reasoning or rule-based
generalization." (p. 2)
