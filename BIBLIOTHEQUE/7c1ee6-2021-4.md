# Explaining Answers with Entailment Trees (2021)
Source: 7c1ee6-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces ENTAILMENTBANK as a new dataset of multistep entailment trees, making the data resource the central contribution.
- Defines explanation tasks over the dataset to evaluate entailment-tree generation, positioning the work as benchmark infrastructure.

## Evidence extracts
- "To train a model with this skill, we created ENTAILMENTBANK 1 , the ﬁrst dataset to contain multistep entailment trees." (p. 1)
- "Given a hypothesis (question + answer), we deﬁne three increasingly difﬁcult explanation tasks: generate a valid entailment tree given (a) all relevant sentences (b) all relevant and someirrelevant sentences, or (c) a corpus." (p. 1)
