# Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry (2017)
Source: 51292c-2017.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a general framework for supervised learning on graphs (MPNNs), which is an architectural ML contribution rather than positional encoding or a dataset release.
- Emphasizes novel MPNN model variations and improved performance on QM9, pointing to model design/optimization as the main contribution.

## Evidence extracts
- "To that end, we describe a general framework for super-
vised learning on graphs called Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) that simply abstracts the commonali-
ties between several of the most promising existing neural
models for graph structured data, in order to make it easier
to understand the relationships between them and come up
with novel variations." (p. 2)
- "In this paper, by exploring novel variations of models in the
MPNNfamily, we are able to both achieve a new state of
the art on the QM9 dataset and to predict the DFT calcula-
tion to within chemical accuracy on all but two targets." (p. 2)
