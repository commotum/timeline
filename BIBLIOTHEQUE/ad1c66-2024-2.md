# Point cloud semantic segmentation with adaptive spatial structure graph transformer (2024)
Source: ad1c66-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes ASGFormer as a graph Transformer network for point cloud semantic segmentation, indicating a Transformer-based architecture applied to point cloud data.
- Frames the model as a 3D point cloud semantic segmentation network, reflecting a Transformer adaptation to a higher-dimensional spatial domain.

## Evidence extracts
- "To this end, we propose a Graph Transformer point cloud semantic segmentation network (ASGFormer) tailored for structurally adherent objects." (p. 1)
- "In this paper, we introduce an adaptive graph Transformer 3D point cloud semantic segmentation network tailored for structurally adherent objects." (p. 16)
