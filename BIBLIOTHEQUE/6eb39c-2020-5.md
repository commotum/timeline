# Agent57: Outperforming the Atari Human Benchmark (2020)
Source: 6eb39c-2020.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper introduces a new deep RL agent (Agent57) aimed at surpassing human benchmark performance across all 57 Atari games, which is a methodological reinforcement learning contribution.
- It proposes an adaptive training mechanism for selecting policies, reflecting algorithmic advances rather than dataset creation or positional encoding changes.

## Evidence extracts
- "We pro- pose Agent57, the ﬁrst deep RL agent that out- performs the standard human benchmark on all 57Atari games." (p. 1)
- "We propose an adaptive mechanism to choose which policy to prioritize throughout the training process." (p. 1)
