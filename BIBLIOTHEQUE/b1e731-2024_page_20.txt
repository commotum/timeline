           Figure 11: T-SNE of different program embeddings from pairs sampled from the re-arc generators.
           IDs correspond to different generators and hence represent specific training tasks.
           Figure 11 shows a T-SNE visualization of the latent space of input-output pairs sampled from the
           re-arcgenerators. Tasks that are well mastered by the decoder seem to be clustered in the latent
           space while tasks that aren’t learned yet are part of a common bag of programs yet to be learned.
