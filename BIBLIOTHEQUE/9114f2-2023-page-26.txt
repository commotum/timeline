Problem 8. Generator pass-rate: 5.8%. The justification in step 8 is strange,
but the reward model lets it slide. In step 9, though, the model incorrectly
factors the expression. The reward model catches this mistake.

Find the unique odd integer ! such that 0 < ¢ < 23 and (+2 is the inverse of ! modulo 23.

1.3 False Positives

Problem 9. Generator pass-rate: 18.5%. The generator makes a subtle counting
error in step 9. On the surface, it appears reasonable to claim that there are 5
ways to exchange the same colored ball since there are 5 colors. However, this
undercounts by a factor of 2, since Bob has 2 choices for which ball to return
to Alice. The reward model is fooled by this mistake.

Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors, blue, green, orange, red, and
violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob’s bag. Bob then randomly
selects one ball from his bag and puts it into Alice’s bag. What is the probability that after this process
the contents of the two bags are the same?
