# Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men (1948)
Source: 03748a-1948.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper reports behavioral experiments in rats and theorizes about cognitive maps, which is psychology/animal learning rather than machine learning model design.
- The contribution is a cross-disciplinary theoretical account of learning and spatial representation, not a dataset, benchmark, or computational mechanism for ML.

## Evidence extracts
- "I shall devote the body of this paper
to a description of experiments with
rats." (p. 1)
- "We believe that in the course
of learning something like a field map
of the environment gets established in
the rat’s brain." (p. 3)
