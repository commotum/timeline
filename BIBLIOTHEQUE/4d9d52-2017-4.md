# CLEVR: A Diagnostic Dataset for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning (2017)
Source: 4d9d52-2017.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper introduces CLEVR as a diagnostic dataset aimed at testing visual reasoning abilities, which is a benchmark-style contribution.
- The work emphasizes dataset design and diagnostic evaluation rather than proposing a new model or mechanism.

## Evidence extracts
- "We present a diagnostic dataset that tests a range of visual reasoning abilities." (p. 1)
- "CLEVRprovidesadatasetthatrequirescomplexreason- ing to solve and that can be used to conduct rich diagnos- tics to better understand the visual reasoning capabilities of VQA systems." (p. 2)
