Given past 3D occupancy observations, our self-supervised OccWorld can
forecast future scene evolutions and ego movements jointly. This task requires a spatial
understanding of the 3D scene and temporal modeling of how driving scenarios develop.
We observe that OccWorld successfully forecasts the movements of surrounding agents
and future map elements such as drivable areas. OccWorld even generates more rea-
sonable drivable areas than the ground truth, demonstrating its ability to understand
the scene rather than memorizing training data.
Abstract.
Understanding how the 3D scene evolves is vital for making
decisions in autonomous driving. Most existing methods achieve this by
predicting the movements of object boxes, which cannot capture more
ne-grained scene information. In this paper, we explore a new frame-
work of learning a world model, OccWorld, in the 3D occupancy space to
simultaneously predict the movement of the ego car and the evolution of
the surrounding scenes. We propose to learn a world model based on 3D
occupancy rather than 3D bounding boxes and segmentation maps for
three reasons: 1)
expressiveness
. 3D occupancy can describe the more
ne-grained 3D structure of the scene; 2)
eciency
. 3D occupancy is
more economical to obtain (e.g., from sparse LiDAR points). 3)
versa-
tility
. 3D occupancy can adapt to both vision and LiDAR. To facilitate
the modeling of the world evolution, we learn a reconstruction-based
scene tokenizer on the 3D occupancy to obtain discrete scene tokens

to describe the surrounding scenes. We then adopt a GPT-like spatial-
temporal generative transformer to generate subsequent scene and ego
tokens to decode the future occupancy and ego trajectory. Extensive ex-
periments on nuScenes demonstrate the ability of OccWorld to eectively
model the driving scene evolutions. OccWorld also produces competi-
tive planning results without using instance and map supervision. Code:

1 Introduction
Autonomous driving has been widely explored in recent years and demonstrated
promising results in various scenarios [21,58,67,71]. While LiDAR-based models
typically show strong performance and robustness in 3D perception due to its
capture of structural information [7,36,52,62,63], the more hardware-economical
vision-centric solutions have dramatically caught up with the increased percep-
tion ability of deep networks [19,33,34,43,45].
Forecasting future scene evolutions is important to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. Most existing methods follow a conventional pipeline of percep-
tion, prediction, and planning [17,18,26]. Perception aims to obtain a semantic
understanding of the surrounding scene such as 3D object detection [19,33,34,65]
and semantic map construction [31,35,37,68]. The subsequent prediction module
captures the motion of other trac participants [11,14,25,68], and the planning
module then makes decisions based on previous outputs [17,18,26,46]. However,
this serial design usually requires ground-truth labels at each stage of training,
yet the instance-level bounding boxes and high-denition maps are dicult to
annotate. Furthermore, they usually only predict the motion of object bounding
boxes, failing to capture more ne-grained information about the 3D scene.
In this paper, we explore a new paradigm to simultaneously predict the evo-
lution of the surrounding scene and plan the future trajectory of the self-driving
vehicle. We propose OccWorld, a world model in the 3D semantic occupancy
space, to model the development of the driving scenes. We adopt 3D semantic
occupancy as the scene representation over the conventional 3D bounding boxes
and segmentation maps, which can describe the more ne-grained 3D structure
of the scene. Moreover, 3D occupancy can be eectively learned from sparse Li-
DAR points [21], and thus is a potentially more economical way to describe the
surrounding scenes. Given the 3D semantic occupancy representation of the cur-
rent scene, OccWorld aims to predict how it evolves as the self-driving vehicle
advances. To achieve this, we rst employ a vector-quantized variational au-
toencoder (VQVAE) [42] to rene high-level concepts and obtain discrete scene
tokens in a self-supervised manner. We then tailor the generative pre-training
transformers (GPT) [2] architecture and propose a spatial-temporal generative
transformer to predict the subsequent scene tokens and ego tokens to forecast the
future occupancy and ego trajectory, respectively. We rst perform spatial mix-
ing to aggregate scene tokens and obtain multi-scale tokens to represent scenes
at multiple levels. We then apply temporal attention to tokens at dierent levels
to predict tokens for the next frame and use a U-net structure to integrate them.


=== PAGE 3 ===
OccWorld 3
Finally, we use the trained VQVAE decoder to transform scene tokens to the
occupancy space and learn a trajectory decoder to obtain ego planning results.
To demonstrate the eectiveness of OccWorld, we formulate a challenging
task of 4D occupancy forecasting, which aims to predict the 3D occupancy of
the following frames given a few past frames. Our OccWorld can eectively fore-
cast future evolutions including moving agents and static elements as shown
in Figure 1, and achieves an average IoU of 26.63 and mIoU of 17.13 for 3
s
future given 2
s
history, OccWorld can also produce planning trajectories with
an L2 error of 1.17 and a collision rate of 0.60%
without using any instance and
map annotations
. Combined with self-supervised 3D occupancy learned from im-
ages [20], OccWorld achieves non-trivial 4D occupancy forecasting and planning
results
without any human-annotated labels
, paving the way for scaling to large
interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving models.
2 Related Work
3D Occupancy Prediction:
3D occupancy prediction aims to predict whether
each voxel in the 3D space is occupied and its semantic label if occupied [21,
22, 53, 54, 57, 58, 69, 72]. Early methods exploited LiDAR as inputs to complete
the 3D occupancy of the entire 3D scene [6, 30, 47, 60]. Recent methods began
to explore the more challenging vision-based 3D occupancy prediction [4,21] or
applying vision backbones to eciently perform LiDAR-based 3D occupancy pre-
diction [72]. 3D occupancy provides more comprehensive descriptions of the sur-
rounding scene and includes both dynamic and static elements [21,58,72]. It can
also be eciently learned from sparse accumulated multiple LiDAR scans [58],
LiDAR [21], or video sequences [5]. However, existing methods only focus on
obtaining the 3D semantic occupancy and ignore its temporal evolution, which
is vital to the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we explore the task
of 4D occupancy forecasting and propose a 3D occupancy world model to for it.
World Models for Autonomous Driving:
World models have a long
history in control engineering and articial intelligence [50], which are usually
dened as producing the next scene observation given action and past observa-
tions [12]. The development of deep neural networks [13,49,51] promoted the use
of deep generative models [10, 29] as world models. Based on large pre-trained
image generative models like StableDiusion [48], recent methods [9,15,32,56,61]
can generate realistic driving sequences of diverse scenarios. However, they pro-
duce future observations in the 2D image space, lacking understanding of the 3D
surrounding scene. Some other methods explore forecasting point clouds using
unannotated LiDAR scans [27, 28, 41, 59], which ignore the semantic informa-
tion and cannot be applied to vision-based or fusion-based autonomous driving.
Considering this, we explore a world model in the 3D occupancy space to more
comprehensively model the 3D scene evolution.
End-to-End Autonomous Driving:
The ultimate goal of autonomous
driving is to obtain controlling signals based on observations of the surround-
ing scenes. Recent methods follow this concept to output planning results for

the ego car given sensor inputs [17, 18, 26, 54, 64]. Most of them follow a con-
ventional pipeline of perception [21,33,34,58,67], prediction [11,14,38,68], and
planning [23, 24, 55, 70]. They usually rst perform BEV perception to extract
relevant information (e.g., 3D agent boxes, semantic maps, tracklets) and then
exploit them to infer future trajectories of agents and the ego vehicle. The fol-
lowing methods incorporated more data [64] or extracted more intermediate
features [17,18,26] to provide more information for the planner, which achieved
remarkable performance. Most methods only model object motions and cannot
capture the ne-grained structural and semantic information of the surround-
ings [11, 14, 25, 26, 68]. Dierently, we propose a world model to predict the
evolution of both the surrounding dynamic and static elements.
3 Proposed Approach
3.1 World Model for Autonomous Driving
Autonomous driving aims to automatically steer a vehicle to fully prevent or
partially reduce actions from human drivers [18]. Formally, the objective of au-
tonomous driving is to obtain the control commands

As the mapping from trajectories to control signals is highly dependent on
the vehicle specications and status, the literature usually assumes a given sat-
isfactory controller and focuses on trajectory planning. An autonomous driving
model

then takes input as the sensor inputs and ego trajectory from the past
T

The conventional pipeline usually follows a design of perception, prediction,
and planning [17,18,26]. The perception module
p

perceives the surrounding
scenes and extracts high-level information
z
from the input sensor data
s
. The
prediction module
p

then integrates the high-level information
z
to predict the

of each agent in the scene. The planning module

nally

to plan the motion of
the ego vehicle. The conventional pipeline can be formulated as:

Despite the promising performance of this framework [17, 18, 26], it usually
requires labels at each stage, which can be laborious to annotate. It only considers
object-level movement and fails to model more ne-grained evolutions.

and motion planning.
We adopt a GPT-like generative architecture to predict the
next scene from previous scenes in an autoregressive manner. We adapt GPT [2] to the
autonomous driving scenario with two key designs: 1) We train a 3D occupancy scene
tokenizer to produce discrete high-level representations of the 3D scene; 2) We perform
spatial mixing before and after spatial-wise temporal causal self-attention to eciently
produce globally consistent scene predictions. We use ground-truth and predicted scene
tokens as inputs for future generations for training and inference, respectively.
Motivated by this, we explore a new world-model-based autonomous driv-
ing paradigm to comprehensively model the evolution of the surrounding scenes
and the ego movements. Inspired by the success of generative pre-training trans-
formers (GPT) [2] in natural language processing (NLP), we propose an auto-
regressive generative modeling framework for autonomous driving scenarios. We
dene a world model
w
to act on scene representations
y
and be able to predict
future scenes. Formally, we formulate the function of a world model
w
as follows:

Having obtained the predicted scene
y
T

and the ego position
p
T

, we add
them to the input and predict the next frame in an auto-regressive manner, as
shown in Fig. 2. The world model
w
captures the joint distribution of the scene
evolution and the ego movement, considering their high-order interactions.
3.2 3D Occupancy Scene Tokenizer
As the world model
w
operates on the scene representation
y
, the choice of
y
is
vital to
w
. We select the 3D scene representation
y
based on three principles: 1)
expressiveness
. It should be able to comprehensively contain the 3D structural
and semantic information of the 3D scene; 2)
eciency
. It should be econom-
ical to learn (e.g., from weak supervision or self-supervision); 3)
versatility
. It
should be able to adapt to both vision and LiDAR modalities.

Considering these principles, we propose to adopt 3D occupancy as the 3D
scene representation

D
. 3D occupancy partitions the surrounding

voxels and assigns each voxel with a label
l
denoting
whether it is occupied and which material it is occupied with. 3D occupancy
provides a dense representation of the 3D scene and can describe both the 3D
structural and semantic information of the scene. It can be eectively learned
from sparse LiDAR annotations [21] or potentially from self-supervision of tem-
poral frames [20]. 3D occupancy is also modality-agnostic and can be obtained
from monocular camera [4], surrounding cameras [21,54,58], or LiDAR [72].
Despite its comprehensiveness, 3D occupancy only provides a low-level under-
standing of the scene, making it dicult to directly model its evolution. We there-
fore propose a self-supervised way to tokenize the scene into high-level tokens
from 3D occupancy. We train a vector-quantized autoencoder (VQ-VAE) [42] on
y
to obtain discrete tokens
z
to better represent the scene, as shown in Fig. 3a.
For eciency, we rst transform the 3D occupancy

The scene tokenizer transforms 3D occupancy into a more compact discrete
space to encode higher-level concepts. This rened compact space facilitates the
modeling of scene evolution for the subsequent world model.
3.3 Spatial-Temporal Generative Transformer
The core of autonomous driving is the prediction of how the surrounding world
evolves and planning the movement of the ego vehicle accordingly. While con-
ventional methods consider them separately [17,18], we propose a world model
w
to jointly model the distributions of scene evolution and ego trajectory.
As dened in (3), a world model
w
takes as inputs the past scenes and
ego positions and predicts their outcome after driving a certain time interval.
Following the principles of expressiveness, eciency, and versatility, we adopt

occupancy and perform vector quantization to obtain discrete tokens using a learnable
codebook [42]. We then employ a decoder to reconstruct the input 3D occupancy us-
ing the quantized tokens and train the autoencoder and codebook simultaneously. (b)
As each scene is represented by world tokens, we adopt spatial mixing to model their
intrinsic dependencies and obtain multi-scale world tokens to capture multi-level infor-
mation. We perform spatial-wise temporal causal self-attention at each level to forecast
the next scene and employ a U-net structure to aggregate multi-scale predictions.

where
T
is the current time stamp, and
t

Inspired by the remarkable sequential prediction performance of GPT [2],
we adopt a GPT-like autoregressive transformer architecture to instantiate (5).
However, the migration of GPT from natural language processing to autonomous
driving is not trivial. GPTs predict a single token each time, while the world
model
w
in autonomous driving is required to predict a set of tokens
T
as the
next future. Due to the vast number of world tokens, directly leveraging the GPT
architecture to predict each token
2
T
T
+1
is both inecient and ineective.
Both the spatial relations of world tokens within each time stamp and the
temporal relations of tokens across dierent time stamps should be considered
to comprehensively model the world evolution. Therefore, we propose a spatial-
temporal generative transformer architecture to eectively process past world
tokens and make predictions of the next future, as shown in Fig. 3b.
We apply spatial aggregation (e.g., self-attention [8]) to world tokens
T
to en-
able interactions between scene tokens and ego tokens. We then merge the scene
tokens in each

Our spatial-temporal generative transformer models the world evolution con-
sidering the joint distributions of world tokens within each time and across time.
The temporal attention predicts the evolution of a xed position in the surround-
ings, while the spatial aggregation makes each token aware of the global scene.
3.4 OccWorld: a 3D Occupancy World Model
In this subsection, we present the overall training framework of the proposed
OccWorld model for autonomous driving. Having obtained the forecasted world
tokens, we reuse the scene decoder
d
to decode the predicted 3D occupancy
^
y
T
+1
=
d
(
^
z
T

)
and additionally learn an ego decoder
d
ego
to produce the ego
displacement
^
p
T
+1
=
d
ego
(^
z
T

)
w.r.t the current frame.
We adopt a two-stage strategy to eectively train our OccWorld. For the rst
stage, we train the scene tokenizer
e
and decoder
d
using 3D occupancy loss [21]:
J
e;d

))
;
y
)
;
(7)
where
L
soft
and
L
lovasz
is the softmax and lovasz-softmax loss [1], respectively.
For the second stage, we adopt the learned scene tokenizer
e
to obtain scene
tokens
z
for all the frames and constrain the discrepancy between predicted
tokens
^
z
and
z
. Due to the use of discrete tokens, we apply the softmax loss to
enforce the correct classication of
^
z
to the correct codes in the codebook
C
as
z
. For the ego token, we simultaneously learn the ego decoder
d
ego
and apply
L2 loss on the predicted displacement
^
p

d
ego
(
^
z

)
and the ground-truth one
p
.
The overall objective for the second stage can be formulated as follows:

measures the L2 discrepancy between two trajectories.
For ecient training, we use tokens obtained by the scene tokenizer
e
as
inputs but apply masked temporal attention [2] to block the eect of future
tokens on previous ones. For inference, we progressively predict world tokens of
the next frame using predicted past tokens instead of ground-truth ones.

OccWorld 9
The proposed OccWorld can be applied to dierent types of 3D occupancy
to adapt to dierent settings (e.g., end-to-end autonomous driving). The scene
representation model
r
can be an oracle that provides ground-truth occupancy,
or a perception model that is trained using dense supervision (e.g., accumu-
lated LiDAR [58]), sparse supervision (e.g., LiDAR [21]), or self-supervision (e.g.,
videos [5]). Dierent from the conventional perception, predicting, and planning
pipeline for autonomous driving, OccWorld models the joint evolution of the sur-
rounding scene and the ego movement to capture high-order interactions with
the environment. Combined with machine-annotated [58], LiDAR-collected [21],
or self-supervised [20] 3D occupancy, OccWorld has the potential to scale up to
large-scale training data, paving the way for training large driving models.
4 Experiments
4.1 Task Descriptions
In this paper, we explore a world-model-based framework for autonomous driv-
ing and propose OccWorld to model the joint evolutions of ego trajectory and
scene evolutions. We conduct two tasks to evaluate our OccWorld: 4D occupancy
forecasting on Occ3D [53] and motion planning on nuScenes [3].
4D occupancy forecasting.
3D occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct
the semantic occupancy for each voxel in the surrounding space and cannot cap-
ture the temporal evolution of the 3D occupancy. In this paper, we explore 4D
occupancy forecasting, which aims to forecast future 3D occupancy given histori-
cal occupancy. We use the mean intersection of region (mIoU) of all the semantic
categories between forecasted and ground-truth occupancy to measure the se-
mantic forecast performance. We adopt the intersection of region (IoU) between
occupied and unoccupied voxels to evaluate the structural forecast quality. We
report the forecasting performance for future frames of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
Motion planning.
Motion planning aims to produce safe future trajectories
for the vehicle given ground-truth surrounding information or perception results.
The planned trajectory is represented by a series of 2D waypoints in the BEV
plane. We use L2 error and box collision rate to measure the quality of the
planned trajectory. The L2 error computes the L2 distance between the planned
waypoint and the ground-truth waypoint at a given time stamp. The box collision

4.3 Implementation Details
We followed existing works [18,26] and used a 2-second historical context to fore-
cast the subsequent 3 seconds. We encode instructions and incorporate them via
cross-attention to the ego token. The scene tokenizer employs a down-sampling
factor of 4, featuring a codebook with a size of 512 and a dimension of 128. The
spatial-temporal generative transformer comprises 3 scales, each incorporating 6
layers of spatial-wise temporal attention for scene tokens with 2 layers of spatial
cross-attention and temporal cross-attention for ego planning tokens.
During training, we applied mask operations to all temporal attention mecha-
nisms to prevent the inuence of future information on forecasting. For inference,
we employ autoregressive prediction to foresee 3 seconds into the future based on
a 2-second historical context. We adopted AdamW [40] with a Cosine Annealing
scheduler [39] for training. We set an initial learning rate of
10
 
3
and the weight
decay at 0.01. We use a batch size of 1 per GPU on 8 NVIDIA 4090 GPUs.
4.4 Results and Analysis
4D occupancy forecasting.
We evaluated our OccWorld in several settings:
OccWorld-O (using ground-truth 3D occupancy), OccWorld-D (using predicted
results of TPVFormer [21] trained with dense ground-truth 3D occupancy),
OccWorld-T (using predicted results of TPVFormer [21] trained with sparse
semantic LiDAR), and OccWorld-S (using predicted results of self-supervised
SelfOcc [20]). Copy&Paste denotes copying the current ground-truth occupancy
as future observations. The 0s results represent the reconstruction accuracy.
Table 1 shows that OccWorld-O can learn the underlying scene evolution
and generate non-trivial future 3D occupancy with much better results than
Copy&Paste. OccWorld-D, OccWorld-T, and OccWorld-S can be seen as end-
to-end vision-based 4D occupancy forecasting methods as they take surrounding

images as input. This task is very challenging since it requires both 3D structure
reconstruction and forecasting. It is especially dicult for OccWorld-S which
exploits no 3D occupancy information during training. Still, OccWorld generates
future 3D occupancy with non-trivial mIoU and IoU on the end-to-end setting.
The performance drop over time results from the generative nature of our
method. Driving scenarios are essentially random distributions (i.e., drivers can
make dierent yet reasonable decisions), while the ground-truth trajectory only
provides one possible future. As shown in Fig. 1, the forecastings of OccWorld
might not exactly match the ground truth but are still reasonable. Dierent from
motion annotations, 3D occupancy only provides local perception, rendering the
performance drop if the car advances a long distance. In real scenarios, the
autonomous driving system continuously perceives the surroundings and only
needs to make instant decisions, rendering near-future planning more important.
Visualizations.
We visualize the output results of the proposed OccWorld
in Fig. 4. We see that our models can successfully forecast the movements of cars
and can complete unseen map elements in the inputs such as drivable areas. The
planning trajectory is also more accurate with better 4D occupancy forecasting.
Motion planning.
We compare the motion planning performance of our Oc-
cWorld with state-of-the-art end-to-end methods, as shown in Table 2. We also
evaluate our model under dierent settings (-O, -D, -T, -S). We see that UniAD
achieves the best overall performance, which exploits various types of auxiliary
supervision to improve its planning quality. Despite the strong performance, the
additional annotations in the 3D space are very dicult to obtain, making it dif-

cult to scale to large-scale driving data. Alternatively, OccWorld demonstrates
competitive performance by employing 3D occupancy as the scene representation
which can be eciently obtained by accumulating LiDAR scans [58].
We observe that using ground-truth 3D occupancy as inputs, our OccWorld-
O outperforms the previous perception-prediction-planning-based method Occ-
Net [54] by a large margin without using maps and bounding boxes as supervi-
sion, demonstrating the superiority of the world-model paradigm for autonomous
driving. Our end-to-end models OccWorld-D and OccWorld-T also demonstrate
competitive performance using only 3D occupancy as supervision and OccWorld-
S delivers non-trivial results with no supervision other than the future trajectory,
showing the potential for interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.
Though our model demonstrates competitive L2 error, it falls behind on
the collision rate. This is because it is more dicult to learn safe trajectories
without the guidance of freespace or bounding box. Still, OccWorld demonstrates
comparable collision rates with OccNet which exploits map and box supervision,
showing that OccWorld can learn the concept of freespace with 3D occupancy.
We also see that OccWorld shows excellent short-term planning performance
(1s), but worsens quickly when planning longer futures. For example, OccWorld-

O achieves the best L2 error at 1s among all the methods but reaches 1.99 at 3s
compared to 1.65 of UniAD. This might result from the diverse future generations
of world models, which might deviate from the ground-truth trajectory.
Analysis of the scene tokenizer.
We analyze the eect of dierent hy-
perparameters for the scene tokenizer in Table 3. The setting (
S; C; N
) denotes
latent spatial resolution
S
, latent channel dimension
C
, and the codebook size
N
. We see that using a larger codebook than 512 leads to overtting and using a
smaller
S; C
, and
N
might not be enough to capture the scene distribution. The
reconstruction accuracy improves with a larger spatial resolution, yet leading to
poor forecasting and planning performance. This is because the tokens cannot
learn high-level concepts, resulting in more diculty in forecasting the future.
Analysis of the spatial-temporal generative transformer.
We con-
ducted an ablation study on both 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning
to analyze the design of the proposed spatial-temporal generative transformer,
as shown in Table 4. w/o spatial attn denotes discarding spatial aggregation and
directly applying temporal attention to the input tokens. w/o temporal attn
represents that we replace the temporal attention with a simple convolution to
output the next scene using the current world tokens. w/o ego represents that we
discard the ego token. w/o ego temporal represents that we replace the tempo-
ral attention of the ego token with a simple MLP. We observe that using spatial
aggregation to model spatial dependencies and using temporal attention to in-
tegrate history information is vital to the performance of both 4D occupancy
forecasting and motion planning tasks. Also, only performing the 4D occupancy

forecasting task without predicting motion reduces the performance. This veri-
es the eectiveness of joint modeling of scene evolutions and ego trajectories.
Finally, discarding the ego temporal attention leads to poor planning and sur-
prisingly worse 3D forecast occupancy performance. We think this is because
integrating a wrongly predicted ego trajectory will mislead the forecasting.
Analysis of dynamic object prediction.
We analyze the performance of
our model on static and dynamic objects as shown in Fig. 5. We see that the
performance for dynamic objects is lower, indicating modeling dynamic objects
is more challenging. This is reasonable since the observations of dynamic objects
results from both the movements of the ego vehicle and the objects themselves.
Still, OccWorld can successfully predict the future trajectories of dynamic ob-
jects, which is more important for making decisions.
5 Conclusion and Discussions
In this paper, we have presented a 3D occupancy world model (OccWorld) to
model the joint evolutions of ego movements and surrounding scenes. We have
employed a 3D occupancy scene tokenizer to extract high-level concepts and
used a spatial-temporal generative transformer for future prediction in an auto-
regressive manner. Both quantitive and visualization results have shown that
OccWorld can eectively predict future scene evolutions in the comprehensive
3D semantic occupancy space. We believe that OccWorld has paved the way
for interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving without additional supervision
signals and facilitated the scaling to large driving models.
Limitations.
OccWorld simultaneously models the ego movements and scene
evolutions, yet cannot predict the futures conditioned on certain driving com-
mands. However, the ability to forecast multiple futures based on dierent con-
ditions is important for a world model and is an interesting future direction.
