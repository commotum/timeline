Figure 18.16 Location, extent, and topographic organization of striate projections (@: lateral; A: posterior;
@: medial) to the circumstriate cortical belt. The drawings are composites based on both degeneration and
autoradiographic material. Shaded area represent total projection field on surface views. As shown on the
surface views of the hemisphere, this projection zone surrounds the striate cortex at the 17-18 border and
corresponds remarkably closely to cytoarchitectonic area OB of von Bonin and Bailey (1947). Within the

projection zone, there is a precise topographic map of the contralateral visual field (see cross-sections); note,
however, that the representations of the upper and lower fields are entirely separate. Dashed lines indicate
extent of striate cortex on cross sections, but borders of striate cortex on surface views. Numerals indicate

approximate A-P stereotaxic levels. For abbreviations see figure 18.3. Adapted from Ungerleider and Mish-

kin 1979a.

had examined only lateral striate connections (Kuypers et al. 1965; Jones
and Powell 1970), though the area had not been recognized as a separate
projection field at that time.

These three projection fields thus comprise all the possible first-stage
prestriate relays through which striate output can reach the inferior
temporal and posterior parietal cortex. Undoubtedly, second- and
third-stage prestriate relays also participate in both corticocortical
pathways (Zeki 1971b; Mesulam et al. 1977; Stanton et al. 1977; Desi-
mone et al. 1980), although the exact location and topographic ar-
rangement of these further relays remain to be delineated. But even
from the evidence pertaining to the first stage alone, we can begin to
understand why attempts to produce striate-temporal disconnection by
removal of prestriate cortex have repeatedly failed. In all prestriate-
