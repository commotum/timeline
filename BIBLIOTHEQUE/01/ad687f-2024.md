# ResonanceRoPE: Improving Context Length Generalization of Large Language Models (2024)
Source: ad687f-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a new RoPE positional embedding modification (RESONANCE ROPE) aimed at improving length extrapolation by refining RoPE feature interpolation for OOD positions.
- Frames the contribution as a universal improvement to RoPE and RoPE-based scaling methods, squarely targeting positional encoding rather than model dimensionality or external mechanisms.

## Evidence extracts
- "We introduce RESO- NANCE ROPE, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenar- ios by refining the interpolation of RoPE fea- tures for OOD positions, significantly improv- ing the model performance without additional online computational costs." (p. 1)
- "In this section, we introduce RESONANCE ROPE,a universal improvement for RoPE and RoPE-based scaling methods to (further) improve their length extrapolation performance." (p. 4)
