# Optimality principles in sensorimotor control (2004)
Source: 22f181-2004.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper reviews motor function through the lens of optimal performance and control, which is a neuroscience/biomechanics framing rather than ML model design.
- It centers on closed-loop sensorimotor control laws under noise and uncertainty, emphasizing biological control mechanisms instead of datasets or transformer architectures.

## Evidence extracts
- "Consequently, many theories of motor function are based on ‘optimal performance’" (p. 1)
- "The second category of models focus on closed-loop control: they construct the sensorimotor transformation (or feedback control law) that yields the best possible performance when motor noise as well as sensory uncertainty and delays are taken into account." (p. 2)
