# Neural Fitted Q Iteration - First Experiences with a Data Efficient Neural Reinforcement Learning Method (2005)
Source: 246b5a-2005.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper introduces NFQ as a memory-based method for training Q-value functions with neural networks, which is a methodological contribution to reinforcement learning rather than a positional encoding or dataset resource.
- It emphasizes data-efficient learning via stored transition experiences in a model-free RL algorithm, framing the contribution around training methodology and learning principles.

## Evidence extracts
- "Based on the principle of storing and reusing transition experiences, a model-free, neural network based Reinforcement Learning algorithm is proposed." (Abstract)
- "The paper proposes NFQ, a memory based method to train Q-value functions based on multi-layer perceptrons." (Section 6 Conclusion)
