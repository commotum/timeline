# Chapter 4: Deep Equilibrium Models (2020)
Source: 624545-2019.pdf

## Core reasons
- The chapter frames Deep Equilibrium models as implicit layers that compute fixed points, changing the computation to an equilibrium-solving procedure.
- It emphasizes directly finding equilibrium points via root-finding instead of standard forward iteration.

## Evidence extracts
- "However, the core idea of this approach, that of specifying a layer that finds the fixed point of some iterative procedure, dates back to some of the original work in recurrent backpropagation" (Section: Chapter 4: Deep Equilibrium Models)
- "The goal of a DEQ model is to directly find this equilibrium point $z^\star$, without necessarily peforming the forward iteration itself, but by directly attempting to find a root of this equilibrium equation." (Section: Deep networks and fixed point equations)
