# Excitatory and Inhibitory Interactions in Localized Populations of Model Neurons (1972)
Source: 0fb484-1972.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper derives a mathematical model of excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations using coupled nonlinear differential equations, indicating a theoretical neuroscience focus.
- The work develops a deterministic model for the dynamics of neural populations and analyzes their responses to stimuli, aligning with cross-disciplinary biological modeling.

## Evidence extracts
- "Coupled nonlinear differential equations are derived for the dynamics of spatially localized populations containing both excitatory and inhibitory model neurons." (p. 1)
- "Following up this analogy, we shall develop a deterministic model for the dynamics of neural populations." (p. 2)
