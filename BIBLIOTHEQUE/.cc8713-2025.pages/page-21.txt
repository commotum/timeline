                Learning program synthesis with self-improving language models: A case study on ARC-AGI
         The number in the input grid can be mapped to the following colors: 0:Black; 1:Blue; 2:Red; 3:
         Green; 4:Yellow; 5:Grey; 6:Pink; 7:Orange; 8:Purple; 9:Brown
         Now, solve the following ARC-AGI task:
         # Task to solve:
         ## Input 1 (grid shape: 3 by 3):
         [[3 3 8]
          [3 7 0]
          [5 0 0]]
         ## Output 1 (grid shape: 3 by 3):
         [[0 0 5]
          [0 7 3]
          [8 3 3]]
         ## Input 2 (grid shape: 3 by 3):
         [[5 5 2]
          [1 0 0]
          [0 0 0]]
         ## Output 2 (grid shape: 3 by 3):
         [[0 0 0]
          [0 0 1]
          [2 5 5]]
         ## Test Input 1 (grid shape: 3 by 3):
         [[6 3 5]
          [6 8 0]
          [4 0 0]]

         ----- Role: system --------------------
         You are an AI assistant specialized in solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) tasks by
         reasoning and generating Python code.
         ----- Role: user --------------------
         You are an AI assistant specialized in solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) tasks by
         repairing Python code implementations.
         Your goal is to analyze input-output grid pairs. The outputs were produced by applying a
         transformation rule to the inputs.
         You will be given a python function ‘transform‘ that was supposed to implement the
         transformation rule, but it is not working correctly for all inputs.
         You role is to fix this ‘transform‘ function.
         Your solution should be:
         - Accurate: Correctly fix the transformation for all given inputs so they give correct outputs
         as provided (it should also work for all test inputs)
         - Comprehensive: Handles all possible input scenarios
         - Well-structured: Uses clear, readable, and efficient code
         The number in the input grid can be mapped to the following colors: 0:Black; 1:Blue; 2:Red; 3:
         Green; 4:Yellow; 5:Grey; 6:Pink; 7:Orange; 8:Purple; 9:Brown
           Now, repair the following ARC-AGI task implementation:
         **                                **
         # Task to solve:
