# Call for Action: Towards the Next Generation of Symbolic Regression Benchmark (2025)
Source: d27de6-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper presents an updated SRBench benchmark, expanding evaluated methods and refining evaluation metrics/visualizations rather than proposing a new model.
- It defines benchmark tracks and dataset selection criteria to evaluate symbolic regression methods, focusing on measurement infrastructure.

## Evidence extracts
- "datasets, and evaluation criteria. In this work, we present an up- dated version of SRBench. Our benchmark expands the previous one by nearly doubling the number of evaluated methods, refin- ing evaluation metrics, and using improved visualizations of the results to understand the performances." (Abstract)
- "For this version of the benchmark, we propose two distinct tracks: black-box and phenomenological & first-principles. Table 1 lists the datasets used in our benchmark, along with the number of samples (# Rows), features (# Cols), and the range of values for the target feature(codomain)." (Section 3.1 Dataset selection)
