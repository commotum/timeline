of conditions (the Cs). Each condition is to be matched with a
working-memory element, someplace in working memory. If all the
conditions are jointly satisfied, then the production is satisfied. It
then fires its actions (the As), which enter new working-memory
elements into the working memory.

The standard view of productions is that they are operator-like
entities with conditions, which determine applicability, and actions,
which occur when the conditions are satisfied. In this view addi-
tional search control may even be used to determine whether it is
desirable to execute the production (Nilsson, 1980). However, a
production system can also be viewed simply as a content-
addressed memory. The right-hand sides (the As in the figure) are
the content, the encoded knowledge in the memory; and the feft-
hand sides (the Cs in the figure) are the retrieval clues, the access-
ing structure. Thus, a production system is simply a form of recog-
nition system—it recognizes patterns in the memory and responds
by providing its content.” It is as much a scheme for accessing and

2. The terminology differs here somewhal from the usage in much of psychology and

computer science, which assumes that the result of recognition should just be a yes or
no.
