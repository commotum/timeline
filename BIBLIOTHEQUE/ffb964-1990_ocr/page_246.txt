Figure 4-25. The design of Soar and the multiple constraints on mind.

does not have to do with Soar per se but with the conjunction of
these two requirements with computational universality. Thus the
three of them come along together. On the other hand, we paid no
attention to the requirements of natural language. The major issue
about natural language, from the point of view of a list of con-
straints on cognition, is whether it provides constraints in addition
to those elsewhere in the list—universality, real-time operation,
symbols, abstraction, and on down to learning and socialization.
This is one way of phrasing the current modularity hypothesis
(Fodor, 1983). By embodying many of the other constraints, Soar
may have something to say about this one. But in any event, there
are no aspects of Soar’s design that are deliberately responsive to
specifically linguistic requirements.

The Soar architecture is fully responsive to learning, through its
built-in chunking mechanisms. As noted earlier, however, learning
was one major constraint that was not at al! involved in the original
design (Laird, 1984); it was achieved only after the system had
become fully operational.
