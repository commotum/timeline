368 « Unified Theories of Cognition

ing interest in chaos theory (Gleick, 1988), which shows that quite
simple nonlinear dynamic systems can be essentially unpredictable,
But human cognition, though undoubtedly nonlinear, is also shaped
strongly to adapt behavior to attain the person’s goals. A suffi-
ciently developed theory of cognition should be able to follow a
person's intendedly rational moves, if enough is known of the task
environment and the person’s goals and knowledge.

Thus, it is critically important to find some cases where cognitive
theory can predict long stretches of behavior—long stretches that
are relatively unconstrained, during which humans can be assumed
to be freely thinking. Even one or two such instances would go a
long way toward convincing us of the essential correctness of cog-
nitive theory. Cryptarithmetic has always been a major candidate
for a critical demonstration of this sort.*

This is not a project that would seem to have wide appeal in
psychology, given the methodological paradigms that have occu-
pied center stage for the last thirty years. Besides the assessment of
technical difficulties, hinted at above, it runs too near deep-seated
doubts about the possibility of a truly mechanistic psychology, not
for chaotic reasons, but because of matters of free will versus deter-
minism. Nevertheless, the project seems to me of absolutely first-
tank importance. Thus, we've gone back to an old task and old data
precisely because it is a relatively secure place to start. The goal is
ultimately to get Soar to do detailed moment-by-moment simula-
tions of behavior over many minutes.

The cryptarithmetic task, although done in a laboratory, and a
puzzle by anyone's definition, is also, by all the usual canons, free
and unconstrained. $3 was simply sitting at a table for 30 minutes
working on this problem—just trying to find some way to solve the
puzzle. What is going on in his head is feeding entirely upon the
momentary state of the task that he has brought about and is con-

4. There are other candidates. A good one is the performance and learning of mul-
lidigit subtraction by young children (Brown & Burton, 1978; Burton, 1982; Brown &
VanLehn, 1980; VanLehn, (983; VanLehn & Garlick, 1987). Interestingly, the subtrac-
tion domain is not disjoint from cryptarithmetic, because of the latter's use of arithmetic
reasoning. Another candidate is the area of skilled memory; Chase and Ericsson (1981)
trained an undergraduate to recall a digit span of 87 digits presented at one per second
and did a remarkable series of studies to reveal the cognitive structure of the skill.
Additional work has confirmed the picture (Ericsson & Staszewski, 1989), and it now
provides an elegant, detailed demonstration of the efficacy of the modem view of cog-
nition.
