gravitate back into the comprehension operator as well. These last
steps haven’t actually been attempted, but the part in Figure 8-4
works.

8.1.3, Reflections on Soar and Language

Where have we gotten to? We decided that Soar has to be able to
move toward a theory of language. Once more, we've played our
standard game. First, we read out of the Soar architecture the gen-
eral features of a natural theory of language. Then we pushed Soar a
little bit down this path, first for language comprehension and then
for language acquisition.

Even at this preliminary stage, the theory can be seen to have
some strong characteristics and attractive features. It shows com-
prehension to be a skilled activity that occurs in real time. It pro-
vides a way for semantic considerations of whatever depth to inte-
grate with syntactic knowledge. It provides the outlines of a theory
of language acquisition integrated with Soar's theory of linguistic
performance. It places language acquisition in the context of per-
forming tasks that use language. That is, it provides a theory of
when the occasions of learning occur and how the knowledge from
that occasion transfers back to the language system itself. All of
these aspects come along because the theory is embedded within
Soar as a preexisting unified theory; they do not have to be posited
separately as part of the theory of language.

All the above is laid out only in outline form. The three examples,
two of performance in Chapter 7 and one of learning in this chapter,
serve as guarantors that there is reality behind the outline, but
almost everything is still missing relative to the state of linguistics,

The biggest issue is grammar. There is no question that a gram-
mar can be built with comprehension operators, given the scheme’s
family membership in the class of expectation-based grammars.
There are by now a large variety of schemes for the syntactic struc-
ture of natural language, many with substantial linguistic success
and some also reflecting psycholinguistic aspects (Sells, 1987; Mac-
Whinney, 1987b). In fact, the situation in linguistics seems analo-
gous to the situation described in Chapter 1 on the decision process
(Figure 1-11). Theories are possible, they must be detailed to pro-
vide explanations and predictions, but any of a large family of theo-
ries, differing in details, is essentially equivalent to the others.

The issue for Soar is how grammatical regularities are going to
