36 « Unified Theories of Cognition

current cognitive theories, But the conclusion to be drawn is quite a
different one, namely, one consistent with random-walk models
being a harbinger for unified theories. The details of the models are
not critically important, though an appropriate set of details is nec-
essary to get out detailed predictions. Any mechanism with the
common properties epitomized in Figure 1-11 will do all right. This
means that we may be able to settle on an important schematic
characterization of an elementary mechanism of the mind. And we
can trust the incorporation of this mechanism into unified theories
of cognition that may appear to have quite different structure.

To sum up this whole section, I see a number of harbingers
of unified cognitive theories. None spans the whole of cognition,
though Act* comes close, but each covers an important aspect of
what a unifted theory requires. And what is more important, these
harbingers all announce fundamentally the same theory. Of course,
they differ in detail and each has the stamp of the individual theo-
rists. But where they address the same issues they yield approxi-
mately the same answers and use variants of the same mechanisms.
And there are other examples as well that I have not taken the space
to mention (MacKay, 1987). It is time to attempt to push this idea
forward.

1.4. The Task of the Book

My goal for this book is to convince you that unified theories of
cognition are really worth striving for—now, as we move into the
1990s, The way not to do this is to talk about it, although I have
been doing exactly that in this initial chapter. The only way I know
how to make the case is to put forth a candidate, so that we can see
what a unified theory of cognition means and why it is a plausible
goal for cognitive science. Thus, throughout the rest of the book I
will focus on a single candidate.

144. The Risks
Presenting a single candidate is not without serious risks, though it
seems to me the only way to proceed. Let me spin out some of the
tisks that will bedevil the enterprise.

First, there is what can be called the Popperian damnation. The
reader at some point spots a particular prediction of the theory, and
tecails that in (say) 1965 someone published an article that shows
