characteristic, compared with what most psychological theories
provide. They are no-parameter predictions. That is, the numbers
that enter into these predictions are not derived from the data being
predicted. They were, of course, obtained from other. experiments
at other times. There are only a smail collection of such numbers;
productions take ~20 ms, the minimum time through the perceptual
system (P) is ~40 ms, the perceptual time decreases with intensity
according to a power law with certain constants (Luce, 1986), and
so on. After a while they gain the status of constants, which are
simply part of the cognitive theory,

The values adopted here for these constants in Soar are quite
approximate, even just illustrative. There is good reason to be re-
laxed about these values. The functional-operation level, with its
tendency toward gross approximation, is not the best environment
in which to establish good mean values with ranges of variation.
Indeed, it would not have made much difference to the exercise we
were doing whether the minimum P value was ~40 or ~50 ms
(Figure 5-6). What is important here is that Soar offers a way of
reasoning about the total system from first principles and finding
absolute (though approximate) results. This is an extremely useful
Property for a theory. Also, as has been argued vigorously on other

occasions (Card, Moran, & Newell, 1983; John &¢fiewell, 1989; _ H

Newell & Card, 1985), it is important for areas of application, such _
as HCL, that need no-parameter theories to help in design. Realistic
values for the basic constants should be set on the basis of wide
coverage of phenomena.

Our use of an abstract Processing model in this section makes a
general point. A theory (here, a unified theory of cognition) is a
body of knowledge about a domain. Ways must be found to bring
that knowledge to bear to meet the variety of demands that a theory
should serve. Theories of cognition can be expected to be very
complicated and detailed, Approximate ways of using them are
needed. The functional-operation level of theory is such an approxi-
mate level of analysis. We didn't invent this level for Soar, of
course. It corresponds to the GOMS level of analysis (Card, Mo-
ran, & Newell, 1983) taken over into Soar, along guidelines laid out
by research on SRC.

Approximation at this level has its tisks, as can be illustrated by
the present examples. The unit of accounting has ended up being
~60 ms. This is an ambiguous number. It could be a minimal
