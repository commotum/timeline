Along the Frontiers = 439

of defining the current frontier for the Soar unified theory of cogni-
tion. There is certainly a frontier somewhere out there, though a
random list seems a pretty unsatisfactory way of locating it.?

A different possibility for describing the frontier is to go back to
the list of multiple constraints on mind, which we used in Chapters
1 and 4 (see Figure 8-2). As I said before, a unified theory of cogni-
tion must account for how all these constraints are satisfied by the
mind. Soar was designed explicitly to deal with the first five con-
straints plus learning, and it represents hypotheses about what is
necessary to take them into account. Perception and motor control
are anomalous, in that the design has been augmented to cover
them, but the effort is not complete. For all the rest there has been
no explicit design of Soar—for language, development, autonomy
and socialization, self-awareness, and how to realize the cognitive
system by means of neural technology, embryology, and evolution.
These aspects can be taken to define the frontier. A unified theory
of cognition must ultimately be extendible to provide explana-
tions for how these other constraints are satisfied by the cognitive
system.

These unattended items of Figure 8-2 can be used to construct a
tour along the frontier. Touring the frontier is a proper way to
conclude this book. We shall ask what Soar has to say about lan-
guage, development, the social band, and the biological band. The
frontier of a theory consists of more than just scientific domains.
There is also a large frontier facing the applications of the theory.
We need to consider at least one representative application to com-
plete our considerations, though the frontier differs for different
applications. We will let human-computer interaction be that repre-
sentative. Along the frontier, we will be even more speculative than
we have been in the earlier chapters. From the point of view of Soar
as an exemplar, the following sections are exercises in how a
unified theory copes with phenomena outside the domain of its
design.

3. No two candidate unified theories will have anything like the same frontier. Cer-
tainly the other candidates mentioned in Chapter 1—Act*, the collective systems in
Induction (Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett, & Thagard, 1987), MHP, or CAPS—focus on
quite different domains. Not until deliberate efforts are made for all theories to attain the
same coverage will there be a common frontier, which will then express the border of the
scientifically unknown.
