with the fast cycles of the system. The motor system might have
some properties that could be changed by preparation, such as
being in a state of tonus, but our model for the motor system is not
good enough to specify this kind of modification.

This P-E-A-C-T-I-D-M scheme is defined by the functions that
are necessary to perform the task. Remove any of them and the task
fails. It is easy to show these functions are also sufficient (within the
Soar architecture) simply by specifying operators and productions
that implement the functions that actually perform the task. This
will be straightforward for the immediate-response tasks under con-
sideration. Each operation simply reads and writes some definite
information on the state received from the prior operation. Further-
more, the assumption of adequate preparation implies that opera-
tors and selection productions will have whatever conditionality
is appropriate.

So straightforward is the operation of these systems that an im-
portant simplification becomes possible. We can assume that, if the
knowledge has been encoded in the state, then the appropriate
operators will be selected and executed to provide the next stage in
the path. Hence, there is no need to be explicit about either the
encodings or the conditions of the operators and productions. We
can simply assume the knowledge is encoded and write down the
sequence of P, E, A, C, T, 1, D, M operations that generate the right
knowledge at the right time.

This abstraction moves the focus away from the production sys-
tem entirely and to a sequential scheme for specifying behavior,
This level of analysis, the level of abstract functional operations, is
not a new general system level that somehow squeezes in above the
level of immediate deliberation and below the level of problem
spaces (Figure 4-23). Rather, it is a simplification of the level of
simple operations. Moreover, its abstraction—ignoring conditional
linkages, using the operators dictated by perfect task analysis, and
assuming no problem solving—holds only under the special condi-
tions of prepared, speeded, simple immediate-response behavior.

The abstract functional operations (P, E, A, C, T, f, D, M) are
both necessary and sufficient for these immediate-response tasks.
They are not necessarily unique, however. There could conceiv-
ably be different decompositions of the functions into a sequence
of operators and productions. We already incorporated into the
scheme one way in which this happens, namely, that preparation
