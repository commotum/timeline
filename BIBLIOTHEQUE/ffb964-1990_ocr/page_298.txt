Immediate Behavior « 285

operator, composed of two decision cycles of ~30 ms each. That is
small for such an interpretation, though not implausible as a
minimum. But 60 ms is also enough time for several productions
within a decision cycle. This shift of interpretation could be radi-
cal. The issue can be resolved, though, because the functional-
operation level is not autonomous but an approximation to the ac-
tual behavior of Soar. Thus, whatever ways are devised of organiz-
ing Soar to perform these tasks and leam how to perform them will
determine which interpretation is correct (or whether both are Pos-
sibilities under suitably different conditions).

Finally, I want to end this discussion of. response tasks by re-
emphasizing the importance of incorporating different theories into
a unified theory of cognition. Theories do not always have te com-
pete with each other. Rather, they can feed each other. Incorpora-
tion into Soar, even if complete (which has not been accomplished
yet), does not show that the GOMS theory has been overtumed or
rejected. The GOMS theory posits a set of mechanisms and struc-
tures, and the particular formalisms used are secondary. Of course,
incorporation into Soar is not just a change of formalism. It links
GOMS up with many other phenomena ina way that was not possi-
ble in the earlier formalism.

5.8, Item Recognition

Let us consider another immediate-response task, item recognition
(Sternberg, 1975). A sequence of target digits is presented to a
person, such as 3, 6, 1, 7. Then a warning signal is given to indicate
the end of the targets and the imminent arrival of the probe, say 6in
this case. The task is to indicate whether the probe item (6) is a
member of the set of targets just presented. [n this case the answer
is yes (it is the second item).

The graph in Figure 5-13 shows the basic phenomena discovered
by Saul Sternberg (1966), which have become the hallmark of item
recognition. If the reaction time (RT) is plotted against the size of
the target set s (which is 4 in our example), then under appropriate
conditions—such as the mixing of positive (yes) and negative (10)
responses, with significant proportions of each—three regularities
emerge. First, RT increases linearly with set size. The increase is
very linear indeed—increase the size of the set by one, and the time
to perform the task increases by a constant increment. Second, this
