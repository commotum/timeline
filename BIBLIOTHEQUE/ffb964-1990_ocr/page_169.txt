156 » Unified Theories of Cognition

3.12, Summary

The objective of the book is to be convincing that cognitive science
is ready for unified theories of human cognition. So far, have been
laying the groundwork. I have introduced the major concepts
needed to describe cognitive systems generally, and assayed the
main outlines of the human cognitive architecture. My strategy(as
to present at the outset anything that can be discerned generally
about the human cognitive architecture so there would be just that
much less that would have to be posited in a proposed theoretical
architecture.

Ihave proposed three ingredients as given, from which to extract
these general features of the architecture: (1) the human architec-
ture is constructed out of neural technology; (2) cognitive behavior
is clearly evident at about one second; and (3) cognitive behavior
requires a symbol system. Because cognitive behavior shows up
rapidly in terms of how fast neural technology operates—the real-
time constraint on cognition—they provide enough constraint to
obtain some useful results.

First of all, different cognitive worlds attend different time
scales of actions—the biological band, which is still in the realm
of physical-chemical law; the cognitive band, which is the realm
of representational law and computational mechanisms; the in-
tendedly rational band, which is the realm of knowledge and goal-
driven reason; and above that, with increasing fuzziness, the social,
historical, and evolutionary bands. Our focus, however, was not on
such a grand scale but on what could be said about the mechanisms
and structure of the cognitive band, in which there are four levels,
The lowest level is that of memory access, which occurs at ~~10
ms, the lowest level of neural circuits. The next level is that of
elementary deliberations, which occurs at ~~100 ms. It is the level
of automatic behavior. The next level is that of simple operations,
which occurs at ~~1 sec and already provides minimal cognitive
behavior. The fourth level is that of composed operations, which
occurs at ~~10 sec. This is longer than the minimal time for cogni-
tive behavior and shows a continual shift to a recognition-based
system.

This chapter is highly speculative. It attempts to establish strong
structural statements from highly generalized considerations. We
don’t understand the full variety of mechanisms that contribute to
