laws were programs—passive data structures to be interpreted to
yield action. We argued that the concept was broader than that.
These composable, dynamic motor systems (synergies) satisfy all
the requirements of composable transformations, but instead of
being programs that are interpretable, they are designed systems
that behave. Their purpose in the context of the motor system
remains exactly that discussed in Chapter 2, namely to obtain an
extremely wide diversity of response functions.

For many cognitive activities (though far from ail), the motor
system operates almost as an exterior appendage. This is true of the
speeded response tasks we are considering in this chapter, which
are actions such as a button push, a keystroke, or an uttered single
word. These are overlearned skills that are tightly coordinated and
under good control, whatever the internal dynamics of their realiza-
tion. Some crude timing model is needed for the motor system to
fire up and execute, in order to compute the total time from
stimulus to response, but that is entirely phenomenological. Thus, a
model of the motor system adequate for the purposes of immediate
speeded tasks employing simple discrete responses can avoid most
of the complexity inherent in the above picture. This situation is of
some comfort, given the uncertainties attending on the nature of
motor commands. But, equally, it is just a stopgap, from which
little can be expected in the way of unifying cognition and motor
behavior.

5.3.2. Functional Operations for Immediate Response
We can now develop the operational scheme for speeded, well-
prepared, immediate-response tasks. We know the overall task is to
produce a simple response dependent in some well-specified, direct
way upon the presentation of a stimulus. We know what space must
be used and (up to a point) how it connects with perception and
motor behavior. We know that operators in this space will be used
to connect the encoded stimulus with an encoding of the response.
We know the person will have whatever search control is appro-
priate to the task (because of instruction, preparation, and prac-
tice), so that there will be no superfluous activity and (to first ap-
proximation) no failures of activity.

Given the above, we can simply write down what functions must
be accomplished. These will either be accomplished by perception
or motor behavior, or by operators and search control in BLS. We
