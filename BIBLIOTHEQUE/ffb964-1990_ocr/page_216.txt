hierarchy corresponds to a standard subroutine hierarchy, in the
sense that the knowledge of the system is captured in this collection
of problem spaces. For instance, the top space in the figure is the
space to do the total configuration task by configuring modules and
backplanes. The operator to configure a backplane leads to the
space by the same name. In that space the operator to put a back-
plane in the box might be evoked, or the operator to get a backplane
from the order, or one of the other operators. Each space contains
some knowledge about how to do part of the task.

RI itself is realized in a relatively flat organization, typical of
many expert systems. There is one substructure, called a context
(not to be confused with the goal contexts of Soar), which essen-
tially organizes a single subtask. Increasing the functionality of RI
occurs by adding more and more separate contexts and their associ-
ated rules from the global knowledge of a human expert (knowledge
both of Ri and Vax configuration). The 3,300 rules involve a couple
hundred such context situations. In the jargon of expert systems,
RI is a relatively shallow system, in which the rules are created as
much as possible to reflect the expert’s judgment of what ultimate
useful actions should be, but the system is given no ability to reason
about the task in terms of its structure.

In mapping R1 into RI-Soar, we moved to the opposite end of the
scale, to a deep structure. We provided a set of basic spaces in
which Soar could carry out the basic manipulations of the task of
configuring computers. It was important to provide a formulation
that would let Soar solve the same task as RI by just searching
around without any heuristic knowledge. It needed knowledge of
the domain—these deep spaces. It also needed knowledge of the
task—constraints on well-formed configurations and evaluation
functions on different aspects of the configuration, such as costs,
power limits, and the like. This deep formulation is not conceptu-
ally profound. It is essentially a blocks-like world of gross manipu-
lation and connection—selecting containers, such as cabinets or
backplanes, putting various objects into them, such as components
and cables, and evaluating the result in terms of constraints and
costs. It is an engineered, hence discrete and reliable, environment,
Nevertheless, it is a formulation that has exactly the characteris-
tics of the deep end of the shallow-deep task continuum in expert
systems. Configurations can be constructed provisionally and
evaluated.
