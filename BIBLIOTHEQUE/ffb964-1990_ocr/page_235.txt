state mechanism. These two mechanisms cannot assure that all the
knowledge available in Soar is brought forth, only that there is not
some local mechanism that precludes it.

In sum, the mechanisms of Soar can be viewed in terms of their
specific functional contribution to bringing the system close to a
knowledge-level system, especially if one expands the view to in-
clude constraints of real time as well as completeness.

The picture this discussion paints is of a system that tends con-
tinuously to move in the right direction. We know that no form of
system could actually be a knowledge-level system over any rea-
sonably rich set of knowledge and goals. So the fact that Soar only
approaches such a state is acceptable. However, we do not have
any proof that no trap-state mechanisms exist in Soar. Indeed,
since chunking adds productions permanently, the behavior of Soar
under the impress of bad chunks could constitute some form of trap
state. Moreover, this analysis provides no information on the rate
of convergence or whether there are alternative mechanisms and
arrangements that would converge faster or more uniformly.

There are aspects of Soar whose relation to knowledge-level ap-
proximation is unclear. For instance, Soar’s knowledge resides in a
large collection of problem spaces. How is this knowledge shared
among spaces? Also, what of memory-resource sharing? Do many
spaces have essentially the same knowledge, so there is really re-
dundant coding? Transfer of knowledge between problem spaces is
a related, open issue. Chunking in Soar is a transfer mechanism, as
we have seen in the implicit generalization of chunks. Perhaps the
full answer is already contained within the chunking mechanism, if
we could ferret it out. What of the universality of chunking? How
far does it reach? If other learning mechanisms are needed, then the
Soar system as it stands must have places where it cannot adapt.
This issue of the universality of chunking—the sufficiency of
chunking for atl learning in Soar—is an issue of contention within
the machine-learning field. We who have built Soar believe the
hypothesis is a good bet, though many scientists in machine learn-
ing believe it is not credible.

4.7, Mapping Soar onto Human Cognition

We now need to map Soar onto the human cognitive architecture.
According to the familiar axiomatic view, a theory exists as an
