dent letter strings, to which the subject responds yes or no whether
the string is a word.

(i)... cacke—no, truck—yes, butter—yes, ...

(2)... hope—yes, bread—yes, butter—yes, ...

The response is faster if the string is a high associate of the
previous word. The response of yes to butter in line (2), where it
follows bread, is faster than in line (1), where it follows the neutral
word truck. The standard interpretation is that the occurrence of
bread produces a forward association (spreading activation) that
makes butter more available for a short while. The independence of
the actions on each word is important, so there is no task reason to
produce any association; independence shows the effect to be auto-
matic. Interestingly, for Soar two alternative paths seem indicated.
On the one hand, the elaboration phase of Soar’s decision cycle
seems to be exactly the right mechanism for autonomous forward
associations. The entry of bread in working memory provides the
element that permits a production for butter to fire during that same
decision cycle—a forward effect that happens automatically. Thus,
butter is already in working memory as a known word when it
arrives as the next presented stimulus, somehow saving a little time
(a few tens of ms). It remains to be discovered how free-association
productions might get built in the first place and why the pre-
occurrence of some internal representation of butter aids in the
word/nonword decision. Neither step can be simply posited; they
require working out the details. On the other hand, our data-
chunking analysis indicates that lexical recognition may proceed by
a built-up discrimination mechanism. Perceived strings are words if
they come through this process identified as words and are non-
words if they come through it with a failure of identification (they
could of course be familiar nonwords). If that is the case, then the
forward associational mechanism is located at a quite different
place and engages different mechanisms, and the sources of slight
speedup are quite different as well. Both of these paths require
considerable investigation before an explanation of priming could
be available.

The list of what is still to be done goes on and on. Figure 8-1 is a
random selection, more or less, and the items we discussed a ran-
dom subset within that. Though a sample, it could be taken as a way
