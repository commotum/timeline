tual moves—Q-KB3 to defend the bishop by checking the King, or

" whatever. These actual moves must be generated by further analy-

sis of the details and structure of the whole position. There may be
several such moves and they must each be considered at least
briefly. Indeed, all of the little tufts of one-move searches in the
figure constitute the clusters of moves that satisfy some function
(which is often enunciated in the Protocol). Thus, the pattern of
search behavior is explained by the theory, even to the modification
of pure progressive deepening.

It is easy to show that this behavior pattern is not necessary for
playing chess. In computer chess Programs, the constraint on short-
term memory does not exist. Progressive deepening is never used
there, but always general depth-first search. Furthermore, chess
programs mostly look at all legal moves and do not generate them
selectively as a function of analysis. Hence there is nothing corre-
sponding to the two-level generator of functions followed by actual
moves that characterizes Figure 1-4, Rather, a simple enumeration
of all legal moves occurs and these are then ordered according to
threat value—a very different pattern.! Thus, the theory of prob-
lem solving that explains the observed human search pattern is ex-
plicitly based on the characteristics of the human information-
processing system.

The points [ wish to make about this example involve the other
examples as well. First, the explanation is in terms of processing
mechanisms, just as with the other two, Second, the examples
come from different areas of human behavior varying widely in time
scale—motor control, taking seconds, skill learning, taking hours;
and problem solving, taking minutes. Finally, all the examples de-
tive from seeing the human as an information-processing system.
This is obvious in the practice and problem-solving examples. If it
does not seem equally so in the case of Fitts’ law, itis only because
we have allowed usage to narrow inappropriately. Continuous con-
trol systems (here actually a sampled data system) pick up informa-
tion from the environment and process it to select or determine
actions in the world. This is information Processing, perfectly well.

|. Actually, matters are a little more complicated. A search strategy called izerative
deepening is now commonly used, comprising successive depth-first searches to gradu.
ally increasing depth. But the pattern is still very different.
