Figure 3-2, Expansion of time with levels.

Expansion occurs in time as well, as Figure 3-2 shows. Assume a
system at level N takes time ¢ to generate a response given a change
in its inputs. If K such systems are connected together as compo-
nents to form a system at level N + f, then it will take this system
longer to produce its outputs than is taken by the level-N compo-
nents. How much longer is somewhat more complicated than in the
spatial case. If the K components were arranged in series it would
take Kt times as long. If they were arranged in a big loop, in which
circulation continued until some state was achieved, then it could
take L(K?t), for as many iterations (Z) as necessary; this could be
indeterminately longer than ¢. If they were arranged in a binary
discrimination net they might take only (log)K ). The time could be
reduced to just 7, but only if the K components didn’t interact at all
and each one simply delivered its output. This would be the limiting
case, where the higher-level system does not exist at all as a sys-
tem. Thus, what exact multiplier will exist depends on the process-
ing organization at the level. But there will be some T such that the
characteristic time at level N + Lis Tt. Then, just as in the spatial
case, the time for level N + m is 7” times the time for level N,
where T is some (geometric) mean of the time multiplier at each
level. There is no invariant relationship between T (the temporal
multiplier) and K (the spatial multiplier), except that in general 7
increases with K (perhaps sublinearly), because in general addi-
tional components play some role, though perhaps only condition-
ally. In summary, as one goes up the scale, everything slows down.
Molecules behave more slowly than atoms; macromolecules in turn
behave more slowly than molecules; cells behave more slowly than
macromolecules—and so on up to planetary systems, and galaxies.
