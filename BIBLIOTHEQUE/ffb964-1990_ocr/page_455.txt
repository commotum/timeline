Figures 7-14 to 7-17. In the Srar is above plus example, Soar ex-
ecuted a series of comprehension operators on the incoming sen-
tence, one for each word. It then applied comprehension operators
to the picture. The result was a structure that evoked operators to
compare the encodings and to perform the task required (to judge
whether the sentence was true of the picture).

This is a theory of how Soar deals with any uncomprehended
aspect of an external environment, whether linguistic, auditory,
visual, or whatever. Thus, it applies to both the sentence and pic-
ture. It applies to internal aspects as well, thus to partially con-
structed objects (such as what corresponds to nonterminals in a
developing analysis of an utterance). What is specifically linguistic
about the theory is the knowledge that the environment is produc-
ing linguistic utterances or text, and the knowledge of language.

A comprehension operator is not a highly general operator that
knows nothing. On the contrary, a separate comprehension oper-
ator exists for every word. This individualized comprehension
operator embodies the specific knowledge of what it means to have
that word in that particular context. It embodies knowledge of the
word senses, the syntax, the semantics, the discourse, and the
larger context. Thus, the comprehension-operator principle is a hy-
pothesis about the form in which linguistic knowledge is held, not
about the content of that knowledge.

The theory implies that language action is entirely local, since an
operator is fired for each object as it comes along (each word, for
language). Sometimes the knowledge is available in the current
state for the comprehension operator to produce a structure that
represents the comprehension, but this need not be the case, and
indeed language systematically exploits the occurrence of multiple
words distributed over substantial stretches of an utterance to de-
termine the intended meaning. In consequence, comprehension
operators must be able to produce at execution time structures that
hold what the operators do know, even though the remaining
knowledge needed to produce comprehension has not yet arrived.
Such structures are, in essence, expectations, since their only role
is to be used jater by other applications of comprehension
operators. Thus, language interpretation operates within a context
of expectations. This is not an added assumption but a necessary
consequence of the comprehension-operator principle. Language is
such that when a word in a sentence is heard, it gives knowledge
