would seem to be available. Let us consider the human data and see
how well this theory explains human performance. Figure 7-11
presents data from Johnson-Laird and Bara (1984) on the perform-
ance by 20 University of Milan students of all 64 syllogisms (with
unlimited time) and also on the performance of Soar. The four
sections of the chart correspond to the four figures. Each row corre-
sponds to one of the 9 legal responses. The top number in a cell
indicates the number of persons giving that response to a particular
syllogism. Some archers are not bowlers and All canoeists are
bowlers is abbreviated Oxy,Azy, which occurs in the lower left
quadrant, where we see that 8 people responded /xz (Some archers
are canoeists), 7 responded Oxz (Some archers are not canoeists),
3 responded NVC (no valid conclusion), and no one gave any other
response. Valid responses are shaded. The average was only 38
percent correct and 7 syllogisms were solved by no one.

Individual humans behave differently from one another and from
themselves on different occasions. Individuals differ in their knowl-
edge, in their understanding of terms such as some, necessarily,
and follows, and in their learning, which depends on the micro-
situations they have encountered. This situation is revealed in Fig-
ure 7-11 by the existence of multiple responses to the same syllo-
gism. The clustering of responses on a few responses out of the nine
possibilities shows both the existence of individual differences and
the strong shaping of it by the features of the task situation.

The considerations we have used to determine the Soar syllogism
system do not lead to a unique system, which means that variant
Soar systems can exist within the same general structure. We con-
structed a family of 12 Soar variants comprising three parameters,
with 3, 2, and 2 possible values, respectively (3 x 2 x 2 pos-
sibilities equals 12 variants). The first parameter concerns how
premises augment objects that have nof annotations (3 values);
the second, whether premises that refer to some objects augment
the objects in the situation with the same properties (2 values);
the third, whether or not internal propositions will be created
(2 values). The first and second parameters reflect how negation
and existential quantification are interpreted. The third might be
thought of as an indication whether a person will really engage in
internal reasoning or will only stay with the propositions given,
analogous perhaps to whether a person will do internal look-ahead
searches. Other parameters than these three could be defined that
