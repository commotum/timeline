memory character occurred. The figure shows that negative trials
always take longer than the corresponding positive trials, with the
separation increasing as load increases.

The two different conditions are called varied mappings (solid
lines) and consistent mappings (dotted lines).'* The distinction con-
cerns targets and distractors. In our example, the elements of the
memory set (the targets) are letters. On positive trials one of these
will also appear in the display. All the other characters in the dis-
play are distractors—in this case, digits. This is an example of a
consistent mapping. The distractors are drawn from a different set
of characters than the targets. An example of varied mapping would
be having the distractors be other letters, say X, C, and J instead of
7, 3, and 7 in the figure. On other trials the targets might use the
characters that were used as distractors on this trial. Thus, in con-
sistent mappings the targets and distractors are forever separate for
the whole experiment, whereas for varied mappings the same char-
acters were sometimes targets and sometimes distractors, depend-
ing on the trial.'4

The point of all this is the way the two different conditions be-
have with changes in load. With consistent mapping reaction time
hardly increases at all, either as the memory set increases or as the
display size increases. With varied mapping, on the other hand,
reaction time increases directly with the total load, as required by
having to check memory characters against display characters.
Thus, in the consistent mapping case, identification is automatic; in
the varied mapping case it is controlled, in other words, deliberate.
This experiment is just an exemplar of a whole stream of research
since the mid-1970s that has established automatic and controlled
behavior as a significant and stable feature of human performance.

In the light of this characterization of automatic behavior, the
elementary deliberation of Figure 3-6 shows several points of corre-
spondence. It is fast, there is no control, it is exhaustive, and there
is no detailed awareness. Some aspects, such as load dependence,

13. Letters for targets and digits for distractors are certainty separate. The perceptive
reader will eventually ask about using the first half of the alphabet for targets and the
second half for distractors. Are these separate or not? Shiffrin and Schneider (1977)
shawed they are not separate to start out with (they are all just letters), but with enough
practice they can become separate.
