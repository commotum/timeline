without many capabilities and, therefore, does not seem to have the
mental equipment to develop them. In fact, of course, it does de-
velop over time—so the difficulty is with our scientific understand-
ing, not with the infant's capability. Nevertheless, this is a strong
constraint. As with some of the other items, the relationship be-
tween the learning constraint and the development constraint is
unclear. No consensus exists within developmental psychology
whether development is a species of cognitive learning or is sup-
ported by other biological processes. Again, coverage is what
counts.

(9) Humans must live autonomously within a social community.
This constraint is a little odd, because it is bimodal. One aspect of
autonomy is greater capability to be free of dependencies on the
environment. When we consider how far from autonomy our cur-
rent computers and robots are, the constraint seems to speak in a
major way to increased capabilities. But, conversely, much that we
have learned from ethology and social theory speaks to the depen-
dence of individuals upon the communities in which they are raised
and reside. The additional capabilities for low-level autonomy do
not negate the extent to which socialization and embedding in a
supportive social structure are necessary. If you take us out of our
communities, we become inept and dysfunctional in many ways.
(10) The constraint of self-awareness is again somewhat anomalous.
We surely have a sense of self, but it is not evident what functional
role self-awareness plays in the total scheme of mind. To be a little
more precise, it is clear that considering the self and its capabilities
in relation to the environment—what psychologists call metacogni-
tion—is important. But the link from that to the full notion of a
sense of self remains obscure.

All the items so far reflect requirements of performance. Other
types of constraints arise from our construction. (11) The mind is

* built out of the technology of neural systems; (12) the construction

process is by embryological growth; and (13) the whole apparatus,
both product and process, was constructed by the technology of
evolution. All these technologies have myriad consequences.

The mind can be viewed as a solution to all of these constraints,
worked out through eons. It reflects them all and, given the view of
evolution as a tinkerer (Jacob, 1982), they are woven together in a
tapestry that renders their individuat contributions only obscurely.
Taken all together, the constraints are daunting. No individual sci-
