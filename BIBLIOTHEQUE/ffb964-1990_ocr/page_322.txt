310 = Unified Theories of Cognition

need to be augmented with additional architectural assumptions
about these mechanisms and their limitations. With the current
Soar architecture, the only short-term memory effects we will be
able to derive are those rooted in mechanisms that have some func-
tional role to play in the architecture as a whole.

As we focus on learning, a reminder is in order that learning and
memory cannot be separated from the rest of Soar—from impasses,
problem spaces, preferences, and the decision cycle, Learning is a
side effect of experiencing and indeed of micro-experiencing—that
is, experiences that arise and dissipate in a few seconds. Hence,
whatever determines local experience plays a major role in what is
learned. This is also a somewhat radical and contentious proposal
within AI, where the tendency is to separate the learning system
from the performance system and treat them as separate subsys-
tems of comparable complexity, each with its own sources of
knowledge.

These strong assumptions of Soar are substantively interesting,
but we ought not let the question of their truth or falsity get too
much in the way of Soar as an exemplar unified theory of cognition,
Other candidate unified theories have quite different assumptions.
For example, Act* has a sharp structural separation of declarative
and procedural memory.

6.1.1. A Review of Learning Mechanisms in Soar

Chunking and what we have learned from it underlie this whole
chapter, so I want to be sure the concept is clear at the outset. The
occasion for chunking is an impasse. A chunk is built for each result
involved in resolving the impasse. The action of the chunk is built
from the result. The conditions of the chunk are built from the
working-memory elements that existed before the impasse oc-
curred and that led to the production of the result (by a sequence of
production firings, as shown in Figure 4-12).

Chunks are active processes, not passive data. The fact that we
write them down on paper as C),...,C_— A, does not make them
declarative structures. Soar has no access to them as data. That is,
they do not appear as elements in working memory to be examined
by other productions. They could be realized in a radically different
way than the notation indicates (and they are in our computer im-
plementations, where they are realized by Rete networks; Forgy,
1981). Since chunks are not declarative structures, they are not
