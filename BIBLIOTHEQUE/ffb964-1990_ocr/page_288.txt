it takes only a single production, which is to say, it is a feature that
would normally be encoded for the type of perceptual objects being
used. (The stimulus is not, for instance, the choice between a single
geometric figure being a triangle or a square, which would require
more perceptual encoding.) Thus £ is ~20 ms, marked with a plus
to indicate that the value is in addition to that for the SRT task.
In this experiment, with two spatially separated lights, an attend
operator is required. The standard arrangement is to have the per-
son attend to a neutrally placed fixation point, so that an attend
operator is required in all cases. If the person were to attend to one
place or the other, response could have improved to the attended
choice but would have been slower to the unattended choice. We
are not talking about eye movements in this situation; all vision is
within the fovea; but there is no doubt that attention shifts occur
within fixations (Posner, 1978). Thus, attend requires ~60 ms. The
comprehension operator must still occur. Attend only acquires the
