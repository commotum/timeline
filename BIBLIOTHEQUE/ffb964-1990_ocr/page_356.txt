344 = Unified Theories of Cognition

lem is an example of how a unified theory of cognition can tie
disparate phenomena together. Figure 5-11 noted that the time the
Soar model of stimulus-response compatibility took to recognize a
word was proportional to the number of letters, at ~20 ms per
letter, reflecting a substantial number of empirical results, both for
word naming and reading. The Soar-Epam model determines what
that time should be, namely (ignoring setup) the number of produc-
tion cycles to do the identification (they run serially in the elabora-
tion phase). We know from the current data-chunking programs
that it takes two production cycles per discrimination. This is larger
than the minimum of one production cycle assumed. The number of
cycles is not the number of letters, however, but the number of cues
needed to discriminate the items. This will be roughly proportional
to, but somewhat less than, the number of letters in a word. Thus,
the model of one part of the cognitive world connects with the
model in another. The models are not yet good enough to provide a
tight constraint on each other; but it is important that they are in the
same ballpark.

Fifth, Soar automatically provides for extending the model. At
two places in the above account, Soar would get tie impasses be-
cause of a lack of any further ability to discriminate. Soar must
guess at these points, which is to say, Soar must seek other ways, if
it can find them, to make selections. Guessing is, of course, a
standard accoutrement of many models of retrieval and response.
But it is always a deus ex machina, for it is never explained how it is
that guessing can be a response of the person at the requisite point.
With Soar, the context of guessing (here two separate ones), the
ability of Soar to make a guess, and the way Soar will emerge with
the resolution of a guess are all provided by the theory. Following
this up goes beyond our concern here, but Soar as a unified theory
provides the setting for integrating guessing behavior into the main-
stream of recognition and recall behavior.

Finally, a broader point needs to be made. This solution for data
chunking is a general learning mechanism that can be used to as-
sociate any two items. It might be thought that all learning should
now be done this way. On the contrary, this should be viewed as a
special mechanism well adapted to handle specific kinds of recogni-
tion and recall. It is a learning mechanism built by means of another
learning mechanism, chunking. Chunking provides other ways of
doing other learning tasks more directly than by using the apparatus
