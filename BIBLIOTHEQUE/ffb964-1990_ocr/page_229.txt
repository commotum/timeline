transfer. One might conjecture that this effect is really just a slightly
jarger within-trial effect for merge sort—after all, the amount of
within-trial transfer varies for different tasks. But a direct check of
the amount of within-trial transfer on a run of merge sort in isolation
{the appropriate control) shows the effect to be real.

The second learning curve (bottom up), shows what happens
when Soar chunks only if the goal has no impasses—in other
words, is at the bottom level. The learning is less, as shown by the
fact that the curve is higher. But otherwise the story is the same. If
the task was repeated with bottom-up learning, then eventually it
would arrive at the same place as with learning for all impasses on a
single trial.

4.6. Soar as an Intelligent System

We have seen examples of Soar’s behavior on two different tasks
requiring intelligence. The first, configuring Vaxes, is knowledge-
intensive but moderately routine. The second, designing al-
gorithms, is more difficult intellectually, although it too required
substantial knowledge. The two corresponding systems, R1-Soar
and Designer-Soar, consist of the Soar architecture plus the various
problem spaces and search contro!. One should think of these two
versions being added together to make a single Soar system with
the knowledge of the two tasks. They are kept separate simply
because they are worked on by separate investigators at different
times. Indeed, the knowledge of the two domains of sorting and sets
by Designer-Soar is an example of such a combined system. There
is, of course, communality between the two algorithm design tasks.
They used some of the same spaces, such as the algorithm space.
But a truer measure of their communality might be the transfer of
the learning from one to the other, which hardly existed in this case
{only 1 percent).

We have used these two tasks to provide evidence that Soar, as
our exemplar unified theory of cognition, predicts that humans will
be intelligent. Of course, the architecture by itself does not exhibit
intelligence. It must be augmented with knowledge, represented in
the form of problem spaces and associated search control. This is
exactly what we've done by providing Soar with the appropriate
problem spaces.
