processing specifted. There is lots of freedom in how this is done.
The medium in which the transformations are composed need not
be the same as the medium in which the situations are encoded,
nor the same as the medium that produces action at the time the
transformation is required. It could equally be a medium of in-
structions for putting together a special-purpose machine—here,
for (put x y)—that would simply carry out the transformation
when started.

This great move has forged a link between representations and
composable response functions. Ifa system can compose functions
and if it can do it internally in an arena under its own control, then
that system can represent. How well it can represent depends on
how flexible is its ability to compose functions that obey the needed
representation laws—there can be limits to composability. How-
ever, representation and composability are not inherently linked
together. If the representations are realized in a special medium
with appropriate (analogical) transformations, there need be no
composability at all. Only for an Organism that makes the great
move does the connection exist. Then the linkage is complete.

Composable representation systems are sufficiently important
that we should examine their requirements. First, the medium that
is to be processed must have adequate variety. Even more, it must
be capable of being in combinatorially many states. If not, then it
doesn't provide enough scope, because the world is combinatorial
in its variety. That is, the variety present in the world comprises
many independent attributes, each with many possible values. Red
flowers may be next to yellow ones or next to blue ones, and their
height may be low or high, and they may be swaying in the breeze
Or quiet or being blown around vigorously, and the day may be hot
or cold, and whatever holds now was different an hour ago, and
different yet an hour before that, and on and on. Thus, the world of
the organism can be in combinatorially many different states. Even
if correlations exist between descriptors, and even if the organism
attends only selectively to the environment,’ the resulting set of
possibilities that have to be encoded in any situation remains com-
binatorial. And if the world to be encoded is combinatorial, then the

7. Notice that selective attention, which serves to restrict variety, simuttaneously
contributes to combinatorial variability by allowing the system to be able ta be focused at
one place or another, independently of the state of the world, so that total variety
becomes (possibilities for attention) x (possibilities for environment),
