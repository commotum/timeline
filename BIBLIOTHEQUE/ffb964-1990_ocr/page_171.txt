a

Symbolic Processing
for Intelligence

$< 4 | __

This chapter deals primarily with the symbolic processing required
for intelligence—with the details of a symbolic system that is capa-
ble of being inteltigent in a real world. The prior chapters have laid
out a set of general characteristics that a fully cognitive system
must exhibit. But the details count. If there is any property that a
theory of cognition must explain it is how intelligence is actually
possible. Necessary characteristics are well and good, but they are
substantially less than half the story. Sufficiency is all-important.
Intelligence itself is a sufficiency of capability. To be intelligent is to
be able to do certain things, to wit, to exploit (encoded) knowledge
to attain whatever (encoded) goals the organism has at the moment.
Unless the theory can actually demonstrate these capabilities, it
cannot claim that it has explained intelligence. And to demonstrate
sufficiency requires all the details. Therefore, this chapter shifts the
focus from general considerations to a single system, realized on a
computer, that can exhibit a range of intelligent behavior.

Soar, the system to be described, is also the architecture that
provides the basis for the candidate unified theory of cognition. As
the first chapter made clear, the only way to argue for unified theo-
ties of cognition is to present a specific candidate theory and put it
through its paces. Doing so does not imply that the particular candi-
date theory can yet stand the full heat of scientific scrutiny as a fully
developed theory. But an exemplar is needed and Soar is to be that
exemplar.

A connection is still missing. I’ve made the claim that an exem-
plar unified theory of cognition is what is needed, yet I propose in
this chapter to describe an architecture, Soar, Implicit therein is a
claim that to specify a unified theory of cognition is to specify an
architecture. That may not be the entire theory, but it is its center,
