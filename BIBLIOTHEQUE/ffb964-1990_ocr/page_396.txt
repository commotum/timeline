{after Johnson-Laird, 1983).

nitely cannot be an A; this is the way negation is encoded in the
model.

When the second premise is read, it is added onto the original
model to create a single model of the situation. This is Model 1,
where each of the individuals in the model who were B’s are now
also C’s. However, in addition another individual has been created,
who is just a C optionally, that is, who might be a C. The equal signs
(=) indicate that the properties so joined definitely go together.
Thus, a person builds up a symbolic model of a concrete situation.
Only one individual of each type is shown, but of course there could
be any number of them—that depends on the encoding process.

New facts can be found simply by examining the model—they
can simply be read off. The aim of syllogistic inference is to find
some fact that involves both A and C—that links the two so-called
end terms. For instance, the third individual is a C but is not an A
(the barrier). Since there is another individual (the second) who is
both a C and an A, then what is true is that Some C are not A, rather
than All C are not A (equivalently No C are A). The presence of this
