existed prior to the impasse and some of which arise after the
impasse. The problem solving may go down some path (toward the
top) and then abandon it and pursue another (toward the bottom).
Finally (let us suppose), two elements, D and E, are produced that
resolve the impasse. They would include at least one preference
element that applied to the decision in the higher context (where the
impasse occurred) and that is effective in getting a decision made
there. The next decision cycle would then move ahead in the higher
context, as marked by the right-hand solid vertical line.

At this point, having resolved the impasse, a new production (the
chunk) is created, which is indicated at the bottom. Its actions are
formed from the results, D and E. Its conditions are formed from
the three elements, A, B, and C, that gave rise to the results and
