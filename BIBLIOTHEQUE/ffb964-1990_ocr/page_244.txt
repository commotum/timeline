possible, however, so I list here some of the problems and issues
that Soar faces.

Soar, like any computer system, is a system always in a state of
becoming something else. Many aspects are not yet operational, or
only operational in some limited way. I describe here a current
version, Soar 4.5, but then immediately claim that certain improve-
ments are coming in Soar5, the next major release. These include
some important aspects, otherwise we would not be modifying or
enhancing Soar to include them. Of course, some of these changes
will not make it even then, so it will have been premature to speak
of them. It is a genuine Tristram Shandy situation. In the two years
since I delivered the William James Lectures, Soar has changed
significantly. In particular, Soar5 has gone from the design stage to
implementation and is now being introduced. To update the book to
take into account Soar5 would require extensive rewriting, during
which Soar would change some more. Thus, what is represented to
be Soar is really a moving average through a two-year window.

It is easy enough to enumerate specific examples of important
aspects of Soar in this in-between state. The main new aspects of
SoarS are components of the perceptual and motor systems and the
adoption of the principle that Soar5 is able to remember only a
single state within any problem space, as opposed to Soar4’s cur-
rent capability for remembering all of the states that have been
visited. Beyond SoarS are modifications to reduce the power of the
matching capability of productions. The current one, inherited from
Ops5, seems in some ways clearly too powerful for what can be
done in a single recognition. A more minor issue concerns the re-
quirement for some productions to keep Soar from descending into
infinite impasse pits. Somehow, one feels that the default behav’
ought to be defined entirely in the architecture, but this has not
occurred yet.

Certain things have not been demonstrated with Soar, although
nothing in our current understanding indicates where the difficulties
will arise. One long-term goal of artificial intelligence has been to
construct nonbrittle systems—systems that do not abruptly fail
when they move out beyond some predefined task scope. Certainly
humans show some degree of nonbrittleness, although we may
overestimate it (transport a steelworker to the floor of the stock
exchange or a psychoanalyst to the old manual Vax-configuration
task, and see what happens). Soar has enough attributes of general
