Legend for justification

Premise: Conclude a premise

Assume: Assume anything

Split: Assume A A 8B, conclude A, or conclude B
Specialize: Conclude any specialization of a universal
Add: Add assumptions to any step

Join: If A and B, conclude A A B

Modus ponens; If A > B and A, conclude B

Abstract conclusion: If A(t), conclude (4x) [A(x)]

Abstract assumption: If assume A(t), then assume (dx) [A(x]
Chain: If A and (if assume A then conclude B) conclude B

Figure 7-9. Sytlogistic reasoning by propositional inference.

Model-theoretic reasoning is not the same as working with propo-
sitions and applying rules of inference to them to derive new prop-
ositions. The propositional reasoning required involves quantifiers,
so it is not completely straightforward. Figure 7-9 gives an indica-
tion of what is involved. First, we translate the premises and de-
sired conclusion into expressions in first-order predicate calculus.
The categories A, B, and C become predicates A(x), B(x}, and C(x);
for example, A(x) is true if x is a member of category A, false
otherwise. Then, Some B are not A becomes There exists an x such
that B(x} and not A(x); in other words, there exists a person of
whom B(x) is true and A(x) is false. Similarly, Alf B are C becomes
For ali x, if B(x) is true, then C(x} is true. Given these two premises,
