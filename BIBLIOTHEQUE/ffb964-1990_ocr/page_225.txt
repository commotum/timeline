de 2. What's your problem? Subset
3. The specification is:
The input to the aigorithm is a set of integers, and the output is
the largest subset of the input set whose elements are all positive.

17. A general solution is: [symbolic execution]
21, Retrieve the input [consult spec]

103. A set of integers

306. What's next? [tie impasse]

411. Let's try to do this: [evaluate]

112, Generate one integer in the set

118. Test if it is member-of-output-set [consult spec]

168. The plan jooks good

160. Generate one integer in the set [symbolic execution}

162. Test if it is member-of-output-set

172. But how da | implement this test?

173. Run it on some sample input {test-case execution}
177. Retrieve the input

250. A set of size 2 with elements 1,0

252. Generate one integer in the set

261. The order to generate items is arbitrary

261, The value of the item generated is 1

266, Test if it is member-of-output-set

277. implemented as a test for it being positive —_{test in domain]
278. The test returns true

280. Store the item in output

301, Go again [test-case execution]

Now, it must actually do the test. Not only is nothing specific
known about the value of the symbolic element, but nothing spe-
cific is known about the test. Soar recognizes this problem (de 172)
and knows to try a specific case (de 173). It starts over again by
retrieving the input (de 177), but now it determines a case using the
heuristic of the simplest case that is not degenerate—a set of size 2
{not size 1) with elements 0 and I, selected from the beginning of
the integers (de 250). Now, when it generates an element, it can
actually pick one, which turns out to be | (de 261). When it applies
the test to it, it can see from the specs that the test should be that
the element is positive. Soar knows this test from its domain knowl-
edge, so it can implement the functional test in the algorithm with
the domain test (de 277). But even more, it knows the result of the
test to be true (dc 278). At that point it can see from the spec that it
