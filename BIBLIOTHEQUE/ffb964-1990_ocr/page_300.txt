immediate Behavior » 287

. Linearity: RT = intercept + slope x (set size)
. Fast processing: slope = 40 ms for digits

Parallel stopes: same positive and negative slopes

. Flat serial position: no serial-position effects

Unawareness: mostly unaware of processing datails

{The first five phenomena constitute the hallmark set]
Presentation-mode invariance: holds for fixed sets and varied sats
Perceptual-mode invariance: holds for visual and speech presenta-
tion

. Negative-set independence: RT not depend on negative set size
. Limited positive-set size: less than 6 to &

Multiple stages: intercept is about 350-400 ms
Encoding stage: associated with linearity

Slower rate with low legibility with little practice
Comparison stage: associated with linearity

Cecision stage: associated with deciding on response
Response stage: associated with Positive-negative frequency
ltem-type independence: wide range of item types
Cavanagh’s law: stape x memory-span-for-item types = 245 ms
Age invariance: holds over age {but slowar}

Mental ability invariance: holds for retardates (but stower)
Practice invariance: extended Practice does not affect slope
Fast-recency effect: if positive set and Probe both rapid
Repeated-items effect: fast if probe in Positive set
Probe-probability effect: fast if high expectation
Distinguished-item effect: nonlinear response

Increasing min-RT: increases with positive set size
Variance increase: target-set linear, positive = negative
Dual-task independence: for various tasks

Translation effect: increased slope if probe is a transtation
Sublist effect: strong effect of Positive set in categories
Positive-set-selection effect: large if done at probe time
Self-termination slow: slope greater than 100 ms
Self-terminating if item-dependent response

search. Thus this result, so beautiful in its regularity, provides a

neat

puzzle—the very stuff of which great science is made.

The three regularities I’ve mentioned are only the tip of the
iceberg. A huge number of phenomena may be found in item-
recognition behavior. Figure 5-14 lists 32 of them, starting with the
three just mentioned.’ This isn’t an exhaustively researched list—

Almost all of these are touched upon in Sternberg (1975); additional sources are

Sternberg (1969) and Nickerson (1972).
