cognition should apply to all areas of cognition, hence why not
to this one? For one, Soar comes with the appearance of an AI
problem-solving and learning system. In AI generally, it is simply
not done to construe the details of behavior of such a system as a
model of human behavior, whatever might be asserted about its
global intelligent behavior. The details seem all too evidently de-
pendent on the programming languages and environments in which
the system is built and on the need to write procedures to do the
low-level tasks. Thus, showing that Soar provides a theory of im-
mediate-response behavior makes a critical statement about Soar
being a genuine candidate for a unified theory of cognition. How-
ever, the really important reason for beginning here is that im-
mediate behavior is where the architecture shows through—where
you can see the cognitive wheels turn and hear the cognitive gears
grind. Immediate behavior is the appropriate arena in which to
discover the nature of the cognitive architecture.

We will first discuss in some detail the scientific role of im-
mediate-response behavior in discovering the architecture. Then
we will make two preparatory steps: discussing some methodologi-
cal preliminaries and analyzing how the architecture will handle
immediate behavior. This latter includes paying additional attention
to perception and motor behavior, since these are so intimately part
of immediate behavior. Only after that will we apply Soar in varying
amounts of detail to a succession of experimental paradigms—
simple and choice reaction tasks, stimulus-response compatibility,
item recognition, and transcription typing.

5.1. The Scientific Role of Immediate-Response Data

When you're down close to the architecture, you can see it, and
when you're far away you can’t. As we have already discussed, the
appropriate scale is temporal, not spatial. The architecture works in
the region of ~~10 ms to ~~1 sec, so only tasks that are carried
out in this time frame will reveal the architecture. As the tasks
move away in time, by a factor of ten to durations of about ten
seconds or even further away to minutes and hours, less and less
specific features of the architecture can be seen in the performance
of the task. The fading with increasing temporal distance is not
caused by some fixed mechanism, analogous to the inverse square
law or (a better analog) statistical smearing. Rather, the fading oc-
