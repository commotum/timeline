304 = Unified Theories of Cognition

human cognitive behavior. Although we had only a catch-as-catch-
can list of properties, presenting the right global picture of the
nature of human nature is also of fundamental importance. From
this chapter, we can say that Soar is a theory of immediate-
response behavior. It provides a quantitative theory at the level of
functionally defined operators. The tasks covered were simple and
two-choice reaction times, stimulus-response compatibility, and
item recognition. It is evident that many similar phenomena could
equally well have been covered, although with what success will
have to be seen. Finally, we have put forth typing as yet another
extension of explanation, into discrete but ongoing perceptual-
motor behavior. Nonetheless, Soar has not yet dealt with any of the
central phenomena of perception or motor behavior.
