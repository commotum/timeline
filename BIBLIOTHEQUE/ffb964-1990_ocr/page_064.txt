certainty. Daniel Dennett's (1978, 1988a) notion of an intentional
System, however, is substantially the same as a knowledge-level
system. Actually, the key concept for Dennett is that of the inten-

Although this knowledge-level systems theory is indeed a theory
of knowledge, it is not in fact anybody’s theory. It certainly is not
my theory. I am not putting forth something that I have discovered
or invented. Rather, this way of using knowledge systems is the
actual standard practice in computer science and artificial intelli-
gence. All that I have done is to observe the way we use this
concept of knowledge and make it explicit.

It is useful to note that this theory of knowledge arose without
specific authorship—without a specific inventor or discoverer. It

consult Dennett (1988b) and Newell (1988).
