108 « Unified Theories of Cognition

Behaving system
A system characterized by multiple response functions on its enviran-
ment
Knowledge
The medium of a knowledge-level system
What can be used to select actions to attain goals
+ Abstracted from representation and processing
The knowledge evel is just another system level

Representation
A system that obeys representation laws

Composing transformations

A general approach to representing

Uses a nonspecific medium capabie of combinatorial variety
Composes transformations to satisfy representation laws
Required if enough variety is required of the representation
Computational system

A machine that obtains multiple functions on some inputs and outputs
by using other inputs to specify functions

Symbol

A mechanism for obtaining distal access

Required if enough variety is required of the system

Architecture

The fixed structure that realizes a symbol-tevel system
Intelligence

The degree of approximation to a knowledge-level system
Search

Problem search: Search in the problem space to solve a task
Knowledge search: Search in memory to guide problem search

Problem space
A set of states and a set of operators from state to state

+ Operators may have conditions of applicabitity
A task is to find a desired state, applying operators freely
The states are generated by the agent, they do not pre-exist
Deliberation vs. preparation trade-off

Deliberation: Activity after task is set

Preparation: Activity prior to setting of task

Trade-off: The relative mix of two types of activity
