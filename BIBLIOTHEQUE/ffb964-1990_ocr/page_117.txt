deliberation used in each task on which it works. The system itself
can be taken as the center of this cloud. The vertical axis represents
the knowledge that is encoded in the memory—the amount of the
system’s resources that is devoted to preparedness. In many cur-
rent AI systems preparedness can be measured by the number of
rules, or productions, it contains, 10, 100, 1,000, or more. The units
are appropriately logarithmic. As more rules are added, they tend to
cover special cases, so that more and more mules are required to get
the same increment in coverage. The horizontal axis represents the
knowledge that is obtained by considering multiple situations—by
searching. In current AI systems deliberation can be measured by
the number of situations considered, and again the units are appro-
priately logarithmic. With an exponential fan out of search, getting
an additional increment of coverage requires considering a muiti-
plicative increase in total situations.

The curves in the figure are equal-performance isobars. Systems
at different points on the same isobar (A and B) will be equally
effective, but they will attain that effectiveness by a different mix of
immediately available knowledge, prepared ahead of time, and of
deliberation about the current situation. In general, if a system is
located at some point on an isobar (say point A), then there is
another system that spends a little less of its time accessing rules
and more of its time searching and that ends up at the same per-
formance. The isobars form a family of roughly parallel curves,
with performance improving as one moves up and to the right
(along the big arrow), where both immediate knowledge and search
increase.

The isobars represent curves of equal performance, not curves of
equal computational cost. A family of equal-cost isobars also ex-
ists, as shown in Figure 2-20, for it takes computing resources to do
either knowledge search or problem search. The cost isobars cross
the performance isobars, just as in analogous forms of economic
reasoning (which this situation strongly resembles). Cost isobars
might even be almost straight. Thus, there is clearly an optimal mix
for a system, where the cost isobars touch the highest performance
isobar. The heavy arrow in the figure runs through these optimal-
mix points, These constitute best trade-offs between amount of
problem search and amount of knowledge search.

Particular systems are located at particular places in Figure 2-19.
In fact, the figure can be used to sketch a history of artificial intelli-
