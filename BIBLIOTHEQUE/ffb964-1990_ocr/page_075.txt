Figure 2-7. List representation of the blocks world,

encoded into an internal process (put A C) that modifies the list
structure: If x is the last item on its sublist, move it to the end of the
sublist containing y. Although written in English, many readers will
have instantly recoded this prescription into Lisp. This Lisp pro-
gram is an expression composed according to a fixed scheme of
interpretation (that of Lisp) so that it does exactly the transforma-
tion that satisfies the external transformation. This composed trans-
formation depends, of course, on how the encoding of the situation
was set up. If it had been set up so that the top blocks were first in
the list and the table 7 (being superfluous) was dropped, then the
program (put x y) would no longer satisfy the Tepresentation law
(precisely not!). But a new Lisp function could easily be written
that would. Nothing in the basic representational medium—list
Structures—bears any direct or necessary relation to the blocks
world, What the representational medium does do is offer an un-
limited variety of ways of encoding blocks-world situations such
that, for each of them, Lisp functions can be written to satisfy
appropriate representation laws.

We are now on familiar ground, for we understand well what it
means to talk about composable transformations, however remote
that might have seemed fifty years ago. Indeed, it is necessary to go
back at least fifty years to become innocent of programmable sys-
tems. What is needed is a medium—in Figure 2-7 it is list struc-
tures, the same medium as the situations—and an interpreter that
takes a structure in the medium and interprets it to carry out the
