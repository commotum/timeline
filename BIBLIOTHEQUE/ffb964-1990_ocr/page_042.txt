Unified Theories of Cognition = 29

above that of the production. All activity takes place in a single
problem space, with productions as operators. This reflects in part
the relatively short duration of the behavior Act* is aimed at, but
genuine extension is still required for Act* to cope with behavior
above a minute or two in duration.

In an important sense, all these criticisms are beside the point.

 Act*, in my opinion, is the first unified theory of cognition. It has
pride of place. It has joined together enough coverage of cogni-
tive phenomena with enough precision as a theory. It provides
a threshold of success which all other candidates for being a uni-
fied theory of cognition must exceed.

Act* is not the only harbinger, though. The recent book on In-
duction (Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett, & Thagard, 1987) is another. It
is a strongly interdisciplinary effort, the four authors spanning com-
puter science, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and philos-
ophy, but it is much less integrated than Act*. In fact, it does not
represent a really integrated system, but rather an attempt to show
the central role of inductive processes. Different system vehicles
are allowed to carry the story at different points, such as Holtand’s
classifier systems and then more classical problem-solving systems.
But the conviction behind this book clearly shows that it is appro-
priate in the current era to attempt more integrated treatments.

A harbinger of a somewhat different flavor is the Model Human
Processor (MHP), which is the result of work by Stu Card and Tom
Moran, at Xerox PARC, and myself (Card, Moran, & Newell,
1983). Our concern was not all of psychology but the application of
psychology to the emerging area of human-computer interaction.
We had in mind the need for a theory for designers of interfaces.
The design of the interface is the leverage point in human-computer
interaction: The classical emphasis of human factors and man-
machine psychology on experimental analysis requires that the sys-
tem or a suitable mockup be available for experimentation, but by
the time such a concrete system exists, most of the important de-
grees of freedom in the interface have been bound. What is needed
are tools for thought for the designer—so at design time the proper-
ties and constraints of the user can be brought to bear in making the
important choices. The situation is essentially the same as in any
other design-oriented area of engineering.

Our objective was to develop an engineering-style theory of the
user that permitted approximate, back-of-the-envelope calculations
