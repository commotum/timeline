times and small-sample statistical techniques, all folded together to
get rapid and reliable performance of the total system. The sim-
pleminded way of putting these requirements together would end
up with minimum times in the ~~ 10 ms level.

Let us end with the obvious, but important, observation that the
neural-circuit level remains a realm governed by natural science.
The types of laws are those of physics and chemistry. The style of
analysis is similar to circuit engineering with stochastic signals, but
that hardly changes the natural-science character of the systems.

3.6. The Real-Time Constraint on Cognition

Establishing the time order of neurons and neural circuits brings us
to the real-time constraint on cognition. There is almost no time
available for the neural system to produce fully cognitive behavior.
To assess this behavior we need to establish the time order at which
it begins to be observed. This is easy to do, because it only requires
casual observation of our own behavior. A simple sentence is ut-
tered, ‘Please pass the salt.’* It takes about a second. Reaction to it
takes about the same time—the person addressed reaches for the
salt in order to pass it. What transpired was cognitive activity of
comprehension and decision, followed by implementation and
movement. If the sentence had been, “You, gimme the salt!"’ the
response might well have been quite different—no movement to
pick up the shaker, but instead, ‘“‘Are you addressing me?"' A
reflection afterward would reveal something of what went on—
“‘He’s always so rude, I just wasn't going to be pushed around.”
The time to do this might have been a little longer, perhaps a couple
of seconds. But this is surely cognitive behavior.

Thus, characteristic interactions with the environment, which
evoke cognitive considerations, take place in the order of seconds,
~~lI sec. If there has been preparation, it can be at the low end, say
~0.5 sec. Often, elementary reactions take ~2-3 sec. But if more
time is available than that, say ~10 sec, then there is evidence that
lots of cognitive activity can go on—implying of course that signifi-
cant cognitive activity is occurring in ~~ sec. A neat example is
rapid-transit chess—whose rules establish that only ten seconds
per move is available on average. There is ~~10 sec to take into
account the opponent's move, understand the consequences, de-
cide upon a move and make it. One can be pretty sure that within
