Along the Frontiers = 465

By now, however, it is pretty clear that such movement can occur,
if it is known exactly what a child needs to learn and if this is made
the focus of an individual training regime. Then children can learn
to move up to higher developmental stages and stay there. This
shift from the early to the later experiments, with a complete turn-
around in results, is understandable given the experimental manipu-
lations. The early techniques were generally nonintensive manipu-
lations that were not focused on the individual but were more like
classroom demonstrations. The techniques that work involve much
feedback and intensive learning activities with each individual.
There is also here a nice instance of the difficulty of proving a
negative—that something can’t be done.

This last result about learnability provides evidence for one horn
of the dilemma, namely, that standard learning mechanisms are the
engine of development. Of course, it does not resolve the issue
of why it takes so long. It only says on which horn to prefer im-
palement.

8.2.2. Soar on the Balance Beam: The Issues

Development is a point on the frontier. Soar is a theory of formed
intelligence. Nothing in Soar is responsive to developmental con-
cers. As noted in Figure 8-2, such concerns did not enter into the
design of Soar at all. If Soar is going to be a unified theory of
cognition, however, it must ultimately extend to being a theory
of development. At least it must be for those aspects of develop-
ment that occur within the cognitive band. If mechanisms below the
cognitive band drive development, they must have strong cognitive
effects and Soar must provide the theory for these effects.

So let us explore Soar and the balance beam." Soar can perform
the balance-beam task—it is just another toy task. Also, Soar can
do the task using each of the four rules. The basic simulation is
hardly an issue. The experiment by Siegler is so clear that almost all
the regularity in the behavior is captured by the rules, and simula-
tion adds little. The important question is whether Soar can learn its
way from rule to rule. If it does, then at least it generates a candi-
date transition mechanism, Soar can indeed do this, using chunk-
ing. Perhaps that seems like it could be taken for granted by this
time. In fact, there are interesting and important issues at work
