intendedly Rational Behavior = 381

1. Difficulty tevel: syllogisms can be extremely difficult to do correctly,
though they are simple to state.

2. Difficulty variation: syllogisms vary widely in their difficulty.

3. Individual abilities: people vary in their ability to do syllogisms, in
terms of the difficulty attainable.

4, Atmosphere effect: conclusions tend to agree with the premises on
quantifier and sign.

5. Conversion effect: people behave as if they interpret Ai A are 8 as
All B are A. .

6. Figural effect: when either order of a conclusion is valid (AC or CA),
the order is determined by the order of chaining:

AB, BC > AC rather than CA

BA, CB > CA rather than AC
No prediction is made for the other two figures: BA, BC and AB, CB.

7, Concreteness effect: the content of syllagisms affects the difficulty
relative to abstract syilogisms, sometimes easier, sometimes harder.

Figure 7-7, The regularities of syllogistic reasoning.

point of observing how many regularities are already known in
psychology. For syllogisms, I must admit—somewhat contrary to
my central tenet—that psychology seems to have discovered rela-
tively few phenomena. The central question of difficulty seems to
have dominated, probably because it has received unsatisfactory
answers. Figure 7-7 gives a few regularities that have been found,
but I would be hard pressed to produce thirty.

The first three regularities decompose the central conundrum into
its independent constituents. (1) The individual premises are easy
to comprehend and the task is easy to state. Yet, syllogisms can be
extremely difficult. (2) The degree of difficulty depends strongly on
the particular syllogism. Our two examples showed the extremes.
Thus, it is not just that the task of syllogistic reasoning per se is
surprisingly difficult. (3) The difficulty varies according to intellec-
tual capability. The left-hand syllogism was so easy that everyone
got it. The right-hand syllogism was hard, but for the first two test
groups it was very hard whereas for the second two groups, half
solved it.

(4) One of the earliest regularities discovered is the atmosphere
effect (Woodworth & Sells, 1935). If either premise is particular
(some), then universal conclusions (all) rarely occur (which of
course agrees with valid reasoning). However, if both premises are
