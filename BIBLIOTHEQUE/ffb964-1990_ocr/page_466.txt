Fourth, the prior point drives the source of linguistic regularities
back to the structure of this basic-language space and to the ques-
tion of where this space comes from.® A key aspect of this space is
its symbols, the symbols that are used for the states in this space
and the operators. These symbols play the role of the primitive
grammatical categories, such as noun phrase, verb phrase, deter-
miner, and the like. As the variety of syntax systems show, there is
some freedom in the formulation of an adequate category system
for language. What is important is that a category system must
exist. Categories can simply be posited as the given structure of the
base space, analogously to the way they are posited in almost all
grammars. However, the question of the origin of the categories
will surely not be far away.

Assuming all the above to work out, there is little to indicate that
the Soar comprehension-operator scheme will be radically different
from existing schemes, Rather, I think that it can be safely assumed
it will be consonant with the existing family of parsing schemes. All
of these reflect the same basic regularities of language, and the Soar
scheme must as well. In sum, although no strong answer can be
provided to whether Soar and the comprehension-operator scheme
can show language-wide regularities, the path toward exploring this
question is fairly well marked.

We have enunciated what seems the obvious Soar theory of lan-
guage. It could be different. The comprehension-operator principle
is an added assumption beyond the Soar architecture, analogous to
the assumption of annotated models. Like the latter, it does not
seem to be an additional architectural assumption, but rather a way
of organizing and representing specific task domains. Certainly,
Soar can process language by other means. Indeed, early on we did
construct Dypar-Soar, a version of Soar that parsed natural lan-
guage according to the case-based scheme in the Dypar parser
{Boggs & Carbonell, 1983). But humans, as well, can parse sen-
tences by other means than their naturally acquired mode of com-
prehending. Linguists of different persuasions prove this every day
by their practice in applying their own theories. Their behavior is
deliberate, of course. With practice this behavior also becomes

8. Whether chunking can transmit the regularities to the comprehension operators is
also a valid issue, though we don’t pursue it.
