and schemas, but no AI systems were built using chunks. At least
one simulation of chunking was developed (for the chess-
perception experiments; Simon & Gilmartin, 1973), but it was nar-
rowly focused. Chunking remained mostly a way of analyzing ex-
perimental results.

In 1982, Paut Rosenbloom built a system, called Xaps2, that used
chunking to deal with the power law of practice of Figure 1-3
(Rosenbloom & Newell, 1987}. As shown in Figure 6-9, chunks
were realized by productions. A chunk actually requires three pro-
ductions. One encodes the stimulus items into a chunk: if R, C, A,
then put RCA in working memory. One decodes a chunk name into
separate elements: if RCA, then put /r/, /c/, /a/ into working mem-
ory. (Note that the name is not decoded into the same stimulus
elements as were originally given but into response codes). The
third production arises from the need to control when the decoding
is to happen—when the response is to be given. Rosenbloom called
this a mapping production, for taking the internal stimulus code
into the internal response code, but with additional conditions for
goal elements, to provide control. In Xaps2, there was a hierarchy
of stimulus (encoding) productions, which all ran freely in parallel.
Correspondingly, there was a hierarchy of response (decoding) pro-
ductions, which also ran freely in parallel. The mapping produc-
tions were controlled by the task, which allowed them to gate which
response would occur. The Xaps2 system produced the power law
of practice.

The original Xaps2 version built chunks according to experi-
ence—just as indicated by the original psychological work on
chunking. Chunking gathered up whatever was delivered into short-
