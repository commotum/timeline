Unified Theories of Cognition = 39

loom, 1987). Soar was raised as an AI system, so to speak, It has
solved problems and leamed on many different tasks, several of
which will appear in the following pages. So it is a real system with
real properties. As is standard practice in Al, however, a new
version (Soar5) is on the way. (Indeed, it is being phased in as this
book goes to press.) Thus it will sometimes be a little difficult to
know what is fully operational and what is not. But in the main,
Soar may be taken as an operational system.

Soar already has the major mechanisms of a cognitive system, as
that notion has developed over the last decade in cognitive science.
It is largely consonant with the several harbingers above. It has a
symbol system and a goal hierarchy. It uses a production system
as the foundation of the architecture, thus being a kind of

" recognize-act system. It uses problem spaces everywhere to do all

of its business, that is, to formulate all its tasks. It has a chunking
mechanism as part of its architecture, and it learns by chunking on
everything it does. In the Soar project we are currently busy mov-
ing it toward becoming a unified theory of cognition in detail, in
ways that this book will describe.*

Though in general Soar fits into the community of symbolic sys-
tems being used in cognitive science, it does have a few highly
contentious features. The biggest one, as we shall see, is that its
memory seems to be entirely procedural—that is, it is made up
entirely of productions. Although it is useful, interesting, and fun to
explore such unique assumptions, it may detract a little from using
Soar simply as an exemplar for a unified theory of cognition, where
the emphasis is on being synthetic and noncontentious. It is per-
haps not quite vanilla-flavored enough.

1.4.3. The Role of Artificial Intelligence

It is worth being explicit about the role of artificial intelligence (AD
in this enterprise, since Al is often seen as contrasting with cogni-
tive science—pure (engineering) AI versus mechanisms of human
intelligence—as if these were different subject matters. Soar itself

4. In part, this is why Act" is not the vehicle of choice for this book, To work on a
cognitive architecture one must be able to control it and change it. So one must have
‘one’s own variant architecture, But also, much has been learned since the specification
of Act* in relatively mature form in 1983, from Act® itself and from elsewhere. Soar has
important properties and capabilities that make it a worthwhile exploration in its own
right.
