mally isolate some aspect of it as input and another as output, and
so we don’t see the solar system as a machine. We could, of course,
and the use of the solar system as a sling to fling satellites out into
far space is a viable point of view.

Given the notion of a machine, a computational system can be
defined as a machine that can produce many functions. Again there
is a shift of viewpoint. A machine determines a fixed function be-
tween its inputs and its outputs. A machine also produces its out-
puts, given its inputs, something not implied by being a function,
which is just the correspondence. Thus, a priori, a computer pro-
