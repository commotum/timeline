chapter. So, in this more speculative chapter, let us see how Soar
would approach linguistic phenomena.

In a fashion familiar from earlier chapters, we can read out the
general outlines of the natural theory of language that Soar pro-
vides. Ata high level, there is not much choice about what it should
be. Language, in Soar, is handled by the cognitive architecture.
Hence, it is a cognitive phenomenon. Language starts externally
and ends externally. Consequently, it is a perceptual-motor phe-
nomenon and so engages the whole P-E-C-D-M structure of percep-
tion to encoding to cognition to decoding to motor behavior. If one
were to mark all the apparatus that was touched by language, it
would be seen to course throughout the total cognitive system, not
just central cognition.

Moreover, language is patently a skill. Hence, in Soar, it will be
learned as other skills are learned, namely, through chunking. Lan-
guage in Soar is a totally functional behavior—because Soar itself is
a totally functional system (recall the discussion of short-term
memory in Chapter 6). That is, Soar is a system in which everything
is organized, not as independent subsystems of data and process
but as elements that will work in problem spaces to resolve im-
passes. A fortiori, language will be dealt with from a functional
standpoint. Those functions of course will be the functions of the
human, and indeed of local circumstances as well as larger ones. It
is easy enough to denote the overall function as communication,
requiring comprehension of utterances on input and encoding and
production of utterances on output, but it is not easy to discover
what these functions amount to in detail, a problem that depends on
the way they are decomposed into problem spaces.

This view of language, that it is embedded in cognition, is simply
the obvious readout from Soar—it is how Soar would naturally deal
with language. It contrasts with much work in linguistics and psy-
cholinguistics, which posits special mechanisms for dealing with
language. The contrast is hardly novel, but runs along familiar lines
long drawn in discussions between linguistics and psychology. Still,
some discussion of this issue is worthwhile, but I will put it off to
the end of the section.
