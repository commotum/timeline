Memory, Learning, and Skill e 343

trol for how it distributes its attention on the different items, and
both of these results arise from simple strategies for learning associ-
ations to anchor points, which are items with naturally available
cues for retrieval. I won't bother to work through the whole list, but
Tinclude it as a reminder of the substantial number of known regu-
larities about the cognitive behavior (like the Salthouse 29).

Soar is in the same position with Epam as it was with the GOMS
theory of stimulus-response compatibility in Chapter 5. It will be-
come a theory of verbal learning substantially identical with Epam.
Soar will effectively incorporate the Epam theory, not provide an
alternative to it. This is an aspect of unified theories of cognition
that I have emphasized on earlier occasions, and I want to do so
again here. Synthetic theories come to join together what is well
understood, and hence already captured, in existing theories of
restricted domains. They do not come either to tear asunder or to
displace existing understanding. Of course, it is not possible always
to join together radically contending theoretical interpretations. But
more often than might be suspected, the appearance of radical dif-
ference masks analogous underlying mechanisms that can be cap-
tured in a unified theory.

Soar’s version of verbal learning is not identical to the Epam
theory in all particulars. Epam is a top-down discrimination net,
with control at each node about what feature to test next, Un-
adored, this structure implies that features are always taken in the
same order and must always be available or the path down the net
will be broken. Hence, Epam nets seem sensitive to environmental
variability and noise, which has been a source of concern all along,
though learning tests at multiple points in the tree might work. The
Soar discrimination net, on the other hand, is essentially a bottom-
up construction which is prepared to use features in whatever order
they arise. Soar has this structure not because of the noise problem
that arises in Epam, but because the entire discrimination process
must happen within an elaboration phase, with its parallel produc-
tions, so that the whole process operates as a recognition system.
The discrimination process must happen without deliberate con-
trol—even though the analog of such processes can be done in a
deliberate way with operators. If the discrimination process is con-
strained in an appropriate way, then it can just run free as an auto-
matic process.

The fourth lesson to be learned from Soar’s data-chunking prob-
