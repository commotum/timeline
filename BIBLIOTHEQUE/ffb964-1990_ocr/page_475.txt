Correct rula

Compute the total torque on each arm

* Torque for each peg = weight of discs x distance of peg from
fulcrum

* Total torque = sum of the torques

If torques equal, then beam balances

weight only. Children whose behavior is described by this rule
know all about distance (as do all children at these ages). But they
do not respond to the distance of the weights from the center, even
if it is relevant to the balance. They just respond to the total weight
on each side (the heavier side goes down, the same weight on both
sides balances). The next rule is to respond by weight, if the total
weights on each side are different; but if the weights on both sides
are the same, then respond according to distance. Distance has
become salient, but only when weight doesn’t count. Thus, the
child’s behavior is really described by two rules, | and 2. The third
tule is to take weight and distance both into account appropriately,
as long as no conflict exists between weight and distance. As long as
weight alone or distance alone determines the correct result, this
rule gives the right answer. In case there is a conflict, various kinds
of behavior occur. In Siegler’s phrase, they just sort of muddle
through. The fourth rule is to compute the torque, the correct phys-
ics rule.

The table shows the percentage of children of a given age that can
be well described by these rules, according to stringent require-
ments. There were 120 children total, 30 in each age bracket. The
None column gives the fraction that could not be described by any
