in the three-blocks world.

any point to any other point). There are correspondingly bushier
problem spaces for larger numbers of blocks, in which there would
be many 3-block subspaces.

As Soar does tasks in this space, it builds chunks. A chunk is
indicated by an arrow on the diagram with a little three-dot figure at
its head, which indicates the desired configuration. The chunk of
Figure 4-13 is chunk number L. It occurs in two places, but consider
the one at the far left, pointing at the state A/B/C (A on top of Bon
top of C). It will be evoked at the state at its tail, the state A,BIC.
At that state there is a choice for which way to go. The chunk is a
search-control chunk that says that if the desired state is a stack of
three blocks (A/B/C) then go to the left, toward the desired config-
uration, although this configuration of course cannot be “seen”
from this state.
