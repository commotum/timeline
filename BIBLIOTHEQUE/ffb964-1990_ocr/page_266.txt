Immediate Behavior # 263

some sort of resource limitation. Such an assumption has shown up
in earlier designs (Newell, 1980b; Rosenbloom & Newell, 1987).
One simple formulation of this constraint is that each additional!
instantiation takes one additional production cycle. By affecting
how much parallelism is available within a decision cycle, this prin-
ciple can affect the time taken in immediate-response tasks while
leaving the general functionality essentially unchanged.

The principle of limited match power is that equality tests cannot
be performed between separate condition elements. Soar has been
constructed by assuming the conventions of OpsS and modifying
them as needed. The most important unanalyzed conventions are
those that govern the matching. They determine how much compu-
tation can be accomplished in a single production cycle. Some as-
pects of this match are quite limited. Soar does a pattern match,
rather than permit arbitrary computations to test if a production is
satisfied. In other ways, however, the match is quite powerful. Soar
permits the same variable to occur in many different condition ele-
ments, where it must have the same value. Thus, if there are M
elements in the working memory, a production with K conditions
can be forced to consider of the order of M* possibilities for instan-
tiation, satisfying a fixed but arbitrarily large set of equality tests
among the possibilities. Indeed, this matching scheme is sufficiently
powerful to be NP-complete (Garey & Johnson, 1979), meaning (for
instance) that one can encode into the matching of a single (hor-
rendous) production the requirement to solve a traveling-salesman
problem. Humans do not have this much power in the recognition
match, so the Soar match needs to be replaced by a weaker capabil-
ity. One simple but plausible version (noted in the figure) is not to
permit equality testing of variable bindings between condition ele-
ments, as now, but to permit testing within a single condition ele-
ment. This makes equality testing a localizable process, rather than
one that can be done between arbitrary subsets of elements in
working memory. This principle also can directly affect the time
taken for immediate responses.

The duration of the match is an unspecified aspect of the ar-
chitecture that exists even after we have prohibited unlimited in-
stantiation and curbed the logical power of the match. How long the
match takes and on what parameters it depends have not been fully
specified in the Soar theory of human cognition, although of course
