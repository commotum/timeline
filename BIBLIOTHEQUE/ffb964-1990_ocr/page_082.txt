wherever it might exist to the place where the input of the computer
exists, and to produce an input to the computer that preserves all
the necessary distinctions. The Job of the output transformation is
to take the output of the computer and ship it to the distant output’,
while converting its form to the form of this output’. Thus, these are
fixed transformations that select, transport, and transduce? objects
in the media. They do not perform the compositional transforma-
tions that the computer does.

There is also a genuine difficulty in this scheme. No system can
produce any function if the input and output domains get too large.

: There are just too many functions. This can be seen easily by com-

puting the number of functions that are possible. Let there be M
different inputs and N different Outputs. A function assigns to each
input an output; that is, for each of the M inputs, a particular output
is assigned from the N possibilities. The number of different ways
this can be done is the number of different functions. This is N*M, or
one of N output values independently for each of the M input
values. This grows exceedingly rapidly, especially with Mf. If N =
100 and M = 100, both very modest, then the total is 107, an
exceedingly large number. This growth is reflected in a theorem

; that says, if the inputs and the outputs are countably unbounded

(such as letting the inputs and outputs have values over an in-
definitely extended past history), then the number of functions be-
comes uncountably infinite (Minsky, 1967). But which function one
wants the computer to provide must be specified by another input,
which is also only countably infinite. Thus, there is no way for the
computer to compute an uncountable number of functions—
because which one to compute cannot even be specified.

This theorem deals with infinities, so it may not seem to be rele-
vant to our finite world with its finite time, Indeed, the comment is
often made that the theory of computability is irrelevant to our
actual situation just because it applies only to infinite computations,

* But the theorem is just an elegant way of indicating a difficulty that

is present in the finite case—and is apparent in the constrast be-
tween 100 and 10°. The amount of input required to specify the
function grows much faster than the inputs and outputs to the func-
