tions. First, people chunk continuously at a constant rate. Every
time they get more experience, they build additional chunks. Sec-
ond, performance of the task is faster, the more chunks that have
been built that are relevant to the task—that is, where the experi-
ence that has been chunked has to do with the task. This contrasts
with the way subroutines behave in computers. In terms of memory
organization, subroutines behave like chunks. Once a subroutine is
built it can be evoked in some other subroutine simply by calling its
name—producing exactly the expected hierarchical structure. But
when the computer executes a subroutine, it runs all the way down
to the bottom every time and executes the ultimately primitive
machine instructions. In fact it actually runs a little slower because
of the processing overhead of passing parameters and jumping back
and forth. The theory of practice, in contrast, assumes that some-
how the system works more directly and faster once relevant
chunks are in place. Third, the structure of the environment implies
that higher-level chunks recur more rarely. A chunk is essentially a
pattern that describes an environmental situation. The higher the
chunk in the hierarchy, the more subpatterns it has; and the more
subpatterns, the less chance there is of it being true of the current
situation. If one chunk is a man with a hat and cigar, and another
chunk is a man with an overcoat and spats, then one will see each of
these situations more frequently than a man with a hat, cigar, over-
coat, and spats.

These three assumptions, suitably quantified, provide an expla-
nation for the power law of practice. Even without the mathemat-
ies, it should be evident that there is a practice effect—as chunks
build up, the human speeds up. The constant chunking rate and a
reasonable assumption about speedup with chunking yields expo-
nential learning. But as higher-level chunks build up, they become
tess and less useful, because the situations in which they would help
do not recur. Thus, the learning slows down, being drawn out from
an exponential toward a power law. Actually, the law isn’t a power
law in mathematical form, but it turns out to be fairly indistinguish-
able from it,

Again, we have a theory to explain a regularity in human behav-
ior, The ubiquity of chunking is what underlies the ubiquity of the
power law of practice. Although the form of its assumptions is
plausible overall, the question of how the speedup actually occurs
with additional chunks remains unexplained. It was just posited
