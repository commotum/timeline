Immediate Behavior = 245

pearance rather than simply take its place as another member of the
chorus. It is the web of regularities that count, not any one of them.

As we have noted repeatedly, behavior gradually moves away
from the architecture as the time scale increases and adaptation
blurs it sharp edges. That might lead to the conclusion that architec-
ture is unimportant except for dealing with immediate-response
tasks (which, however and notably, would include perception and
motor behavior). Behind this conclusion is an important kernel of
truth. This kernel has hetped cognitive science be successful in
many studies of problem solving, memory organization, and lan-
guage, which needed only general notions of the information-
processing characteristics of humans, or in creating simulations
that were embedded in patently wrong details but stil! gave good
results at the more aggregate level.

In fact, the kernel of truth stretches out along a continuum, for as
one moves away from immediate-response behavior, the features of
the architecture do not all fade into irrelevance at the same rate.
There is a continuum of more abstracted models of the architecture,
and this continuum captures the architectural constraints that con-
tinue to operate as tasks increase in duration. A good formulation of
this abstracted architecture can be found in Simon (1989, p. xii):
a small short-term memory; an unlimited long-term memory of
schemas, organized associatively in terms of both indexes and pro-
ductions; tasks organized in problem spaces, in a representation
defined by mapping processes on the perceived environment; with
learning accomplished by growing the indexes or adding produc-
tions or schemas. Augmenting this qualitative picture with a few
constants, such as chunk size and acquisition rate (Simon, 1974),
permits many analyses of long-duration cognitive behavior. In a
similar vein, the MHP of Card, Moran, and Newell (1983), dis-
cussed in Chapter 1, can be taken not as a poor approximation,
reflecting our incomplete knowledge, but as an abstract architec-
ture, useful as one moves away from immediate behavior. In terms
of the details of its definition, it lies somewhere between Simon's
formulation and that of Soar.

Still, it is important to get the architecture right—for all of cogni-
tive science and not just the parts directly involved in immediate
behavior. Wanting to get it right has somewhat the character of an
act of faith, at this point. The argument is that if the architecture is
right, then everything else will go smoothly. Hypothesizing what is
