ception and encoding) is hidden in this operator and leads Soar to
re-enter the comprehension space, where it can attend to the sen-
tence channel (de 16) and begin to comprehend the stream of words
using the read-word operator.

The first word read is plus, which is installed in the state (dc 18),
and then the comprehend operator is applied to it. This pattern will
be repeated throughout—read-word, install-node to new state, and
then comprehend. Thus, we can spot the comprehension of plus (de
20), is (de 25), above (de 30), star (de 35). Although nothing shows
in the trace, various expectations have been set and various objects
created. We see the comprehension operator for above fire again
(dc 37) and then also the comprehension operator for is (de 41).
Both of these are filling expectations satisfied by the comprehen-
sion of the word star, which has finally come along. Thus, there is
some end-of-sentence processing. This completes the acquisition of
information from the sentence channel, so Soar moves back to the
base space.

Soar then gets the input from the picture channel, which again
requires an attend operator to select the appropriate channel (de
48). Soar goes through the read-word, install-node, and compre-
hend loop for each of the three pieces of information from the
picture. We interpret this as if it were another sentence plus/star,
because the pictorial display is so discrete and simple that a more
elaborate perceptual model is not required. The comprehension
operator on the geometric relation (/) executes again (de 66), be-
cause its expectations become satisfied.

Finally (at de 69¥" and back in the base spacd, the compare oper-
ator can execute; it will see if these two expréssions designate the
same situation. Comparison leads to an impasse (de 70). In this
particular case, the expressions are identical structures so there is
no processing to speak of, except for actually doing do-compare
and seeing that the comparison is done, compare-done (de 73), This
operator produces the attribute true, which the respond operator
converts into an external response (dc 74).

We have just walked through a small bit of behavior by Soar that
reads a simple sentence, reads a simple picture, compares them,
and responds. This particular behavior generates one path through
the flowchart, namely the heavy line in Figure 7-13. If we had given
it other sentences Soar would have created traces through other
parts of the space, and the whole would have added up to the
