another. Sometimes a theory is merely consonant with the data, in
that the theory assigns a phenomenon or regularity to some other
mechanism outside the immediate context. It is critical that a the-
ory not be forced to provide an explanation for something it
shouldn’t explain. If some phenomenon is really caused by the
motor system and a theory that does not include the motor system
is stretched to provide an explanation for it, then that theory is
headed for deep trouble at some point. Consonance is to be distin-
guished from no explanation, and the latter, of course, from con-
tradiction, where the theory gives an explanation that is demonstra-
bly incorrect.

Theories are to be used in many ways. We want a unified theory
of cognition to provide power and ease over the full range of theo-
tetical uses. In the main this variation corresponds to what the
theorist posits as the givens from which to attempt to derive predic-
tions and explanations. The bottom part of Figure 5-2 shows this
range for Soar. At the abstract end, only the existence of problem
spaces is posited, in essence, the existence of microdomains of ex-
pertise. Soar will be assumed to have some spaces and not others.
Sometimes Soar can be posited to have certain operators that ac-
complish certain functions in appropriate problem spaces, but with-
out specifying exactly the details of the productions or even of the
conditions of evocation. Alternatively, the full task specification
could be given, that is, all the productions in their full glory, hence
enough to run simulations on fully specified inputs. This is the
standard case, but it is not the strongest case for a theory, such as
Soar, that includes learning. The tasks could be posited that give
rise to the specified productions by chunking. Finally, it is possible
to go even further and posit some general arena of interaction of
Soar with an environment that would generate the tasks that are to
create the productions by chunking. Each of these steps of con-
cretization provides something closer to a fult explanation of the
phenomena under consideration, but all levels are useful. Indeed,
the more abstract bases for explanation have a force and charm of
their own. They permit us to extract conclusions from a theory
without knowing everything about the situation. Scientifically, this
is of the essence, because both the scientist and the applier of
science always fail to know all aspects of the situation to be ex-
plained.
