respect to its realization of the upper-level system. That is so for the
symbol level realizing the knowledge level, the register-transfer
level realizing the programming level, or whichever. Thus, symbol-
level systems only approximate the knowledge level. Conse-
quently, they do an imperfect job of being about the outside world,
This point can be important. For instance, the arithmetic of com-
puters is finite-accuracy floating-point arithmetic with a particular
scheme for rounding. We generally use machine arithmetic as if it
represents true arithmetic, Of course, it only approximates it, and
the analysis of rounding errors and their propagation is required for
serious numerical work
It might seem that the approximation involved with knowledge-
level systems is somehow special. One reason for this feeling might
be that knowledge is almost always infinite, as is implied in its
representation by the implicational closure of a set of logical ex-
’ pressions. It can be said that knowledge systems inkerently can't be
realized by symbol-level systems, because no finite device can
realize an infinite set. This is true, but so are the inherent reasons
why the other levels cannot be faithfully realized—why there can-
not be computers with zero failure rates, or why settling time of
digital circuits cannot be guaranteed to be finite. The pressing ques-
tions of approximation are how to attain good approximations in
particular cases and in practice. To this there can be no simple or
single answer. The entire field of artificial intelligence is, in a sense,
devoted to discovering the symbol-level mechanisms that permit a
close approximation to the knowledge level.

2.6. Architectures

Architectures are a key concept in this book. Unified theories of
cognition will be formulated as architectures. Why this is so may
not be obvious without reflection, but it will certainly become clear
as we progress. The architecture of the mind is a major source of
the communality in behavior, both within a person and across per-
sons. Thus, we need to be especially clear on what an architec-
ture is.

An architecture is the fixed structure that realizes a symbol sys-
tem. At the top of the computer-systems hierarchy (Figure 2-3) is
the knowledge level, below that the symbol level, and then the
register-transfer level. Thus, the description of the system at the
