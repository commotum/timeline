52 = Unified Theories of Cognition

will help to sort out the various notions of knowtedge that are
around. The sociological structure of science, and scholarship more
broadly, incorporates a view that ideas are authored by individuals
of note, who are thereby to be honored and rewarded for producing
and disseminating these ideas. Whatever view might be held about
the ideas themselves, whether actuaily invented or merely discov-
ered, they do not become part of science and society without the
agency of particular men and women. There may be difficulties of
determining who first discovered this or that idea. There may be
genuine cases of simultaneous discovery (Merton, 1973), but some
specific set of scientists or scholars still gets the credit. The case in
hand doesn’t fit this frame, however, nor do others coming later in
the chapter, namely, symbols and architecture,

Computer scientists and engineers as a group developed what I

, argue is the appropriate theory of knowledge. They did so without

any particular author laying out the theory, Lots of words, cer-

: tainly, were written about computers and how to deal with them—
' from highly technical and creative efforts to general musings and on

to popularizations and advertising copy. And some of these words

' have put forth novel ideas that can be said to have been authored, in

perfect accordance with the standard view of science, John von
Neumann is generally credited with the stored-program concept
(though there is a modicum of dispute about it because of the events

: surrounding Eniac, Eckert and Mauchly, and the Moore School).

But the stored-program concept (or any of the other ideas that were
articulated) is not the notion of knowledge-level systems.

I do not know of any clear articulation of the idea of the knowl-
edge level in computer science prior to my 1980 AAAI presidential
address (Newell, 1982).4 But that was almost twenty years after its
use was common—after computer scientists were talking techni-

* cally and usefully about what their programs knew and what they

should know. All my paper did was give voice to the practice (and it
was so represented in the paper). I have been, of course, a partici-
pant in the developing use of this notion, having been involved in
both computer science and AI since the mid-1950s. And J have
certainly done my share of writing scientific articles, putting forth

seem to owe much to computer science, on this score at least; see references in Dennett
(1988a).
