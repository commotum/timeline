additional effort on that aspect. Such local focusing leads to a
depth-first search, rather than other types of searches that save
many states (as on an agenda) and select globally at each moment
which state to work on. Third, short-term memory is limited to
holding a single temporary state. This limitation might stem from
interference effects if successive states were highly similar, or from
capacity limitation, if multiple states required lots of memory.
Whatever the cause, holding only a single dynamic state makes a
number of search strategies difficult to carry through successfully.
In particular, the general depth-first strategy, which exhausts the
explorations of each state and then backs up to the immediately
prior state, is not possible because the stack of prior states along
the search path cannot be kept in mind. Progressive deepening,
however, is a search strategy precisely adapted to this demand.
As one last wrinkle to the theory, an examination of Figure 1-4
ceveals that the search is not pure progressive deepening; one-step
look-ahead occurs quite often, as in the P’ x Band B’ x B moves
early in E2, where search does not return to the base position. This
modified progressive deepening, as it is called, arises from the way
operators are generated. Analysis of a chess position yields the
functions that must be performed—defend the bishop—not the ac-
