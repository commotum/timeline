useful to provide a summary of the things that have been done with
Soar (Figure 4-22). Each one helps to flesh out the evidence that
Soar is capable of general intelligent action.

First, Soar has done just about all the toy problems that have
become the stock in trade of Al: Tower of Hanoi, Missionaries and
Cannibals, the Eight Puzzle, and many more. In doing these tasks it
has exhibited just about all the different methods that have been
important enough in AI to have acquired names, like hill climbing
and means-ends analysis. It has often used multiple methods on the
same task and the same method on multiple tasks—just what might
be expected. Soar has done a few modest-sized tasks, such as forms
of parsing like Dypar-Soar (Boggs & Carbonell, 1983) and version
spaces (Mitchell, 1978), a scheme for learning concepts. Soar has
done a few large tasks. Besides R!-Soar and Designer-Soar, which
have been discussed, there is also Neomycin-Soar (Washington &
Rosenbtoom, 1988). Mycin is a system that does medical diagnosis;
it is one of the granddaddy expert systems (Shortliffe, 1976). Bill
Clancey built a revised and much rationalized version called Neo-
