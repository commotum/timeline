Interpret the environment by comprehension operators
Comprehension operator
» Execute on any object that is not comprehended
+ Produce data structures (the comprehensions}
Interpreted by being used {by productions)
Thereby becoming productions {by chunking)
Applies to all situations requiring comprehension
+ Language, vision, .. . (terminals and nonterminals)
Operates within a context of expectations
« An expectation is a data structure of partial comprehension
+ Required by the task, since comprehension-operators are local
A word can have pre- and post-expectations

impasses. Figure 8-3 shows the next step for comprehension. In
Chapter 7 we actually had an example of Soar comprehending a few
very simple English sentences. The mechanisms used there consti-
tute the natural theory of language for Soar. Its central principle is
the comprehension-operator principle. Soar interprets the environ-
ment by applying comprehension operators to specific aspects of an
environment that it wants to comprehend. A comprehension
operator is simply an operator in the comprehension problem
space, which is evoked to comprehend an environment where it is
not known in advance exactly what aspects and arrangements
of aspects yield the to-be-acquired knowledge. Comprehension
operators are executed repeatedly on the various aspects of the
environment that are recognized until the total comprehension
emerges in terms of Soar's use of it. What gets produced by execut-
ing a comprehension operator is a data structure in the current state
that is the comprehension, by virtue of its being interpretable by
other parts of Soar in doing other tasks. As it is used by other
productions (in operators or in search control) in other spaces, the
temporarily held comprehension data structures become chunked,
and thus get converted into productions, finally becoming as-
similated into long-term memory.

That is the Soar theory of language in a nutshell. It seems so
general as to be almost tautological, but it has exactly the generality
necessary to be applicable in all situations and the degree of spec-
ificity, when embedded in the structure of the rest of the Soar
architecture (problem spaces, operators, impasses, chunking), to
be actually operational. We saw parts of it in action in Chapter 7 in
