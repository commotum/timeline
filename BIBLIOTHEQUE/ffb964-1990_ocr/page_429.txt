recognized and alternatives examined at some point. Ultimately,
such a notion is to be replaced by theories of how ways of doing
things are learned and improved or changed with experience—
exactly what Soar chunking is supposed to provide. One of the
general arguments for the importance of getting the architecture
right, even though it appears to recede as the time scale increases,
is that doing what is natural within the architecture will tend to be
the way humans actually do a task.

Executing the word-comprehension operator is an attempt to de-
termine the significance of the word in its total context (for the
person). It is necessarily an expectation-based scheme, because
language is such that the significance of a word often depends
on words that are still to come. Hence, the action of a word-
comprehension operator, while it can take into account the knowl-
edge that prior words have provided (as processed by comprehen-
sion operators working on them), cannot take into account the
knowledge that later words will provide (since they have not ar-
tived yet). Therefore, the operator must create data structures that
will be used by those later words (that is, by their comprehension
operators) when they arrive. Functionally, these data structures are
expectations. A comprehension operator need not always create
further expectations. Sometimes it will have all the knowledge it
needs to create a part of the meaning of the incoming utterance—
indeed, ultimately some comprehension operators must be able to
do so or the sentence will never be understood.

This scheme does the entire task of comprehension, taking into
account syntactic and semantic knowledge. Thus, the scheme is not
simply a parsing system, but its computational structure is analo-
gous to an expectation-based parsing system. This case provides
another opportunity to reinforce the notion that a unified theory of
cognition (here Soar) does not primarily propose radically new the-
ories for each of the phenomena that it attempts to cover. Soar does
not provide a radically new theory of sentence comprehension.
Expectation-based parsing is a well-explored path, closely related
to case-based schemes. Many of the basic properties of the Soar
scheme are familiar from these studies. Indeed, the scheme is very
close in spirit to the Word Expert system of Steve Small (1979),
which itself grew out of the approach to language analysis devel-
oped by Roger Schank and his colleagues and students at Yale
(Schank & Riesbeck, 1981). The Soar system has some (important)
