times be applied to the sentence and sometimes to the picture.
Comprehension is required more broadly than just for language. It
is a function that is required for any kind of contact with the exter-
nal world. The compare space has the recode operator, the change-
index operator, and its own done operator. This space is in part
linguistic, in that some of the operators (recode) and their search
control come from knowledge of language--for example, what it
means to say that plus is above star.

This is a suitable example for showing a trace of Soar working on
a simple task (Figure 7-15). Soar starts out in the context of certain
trial-specific instructions, which are outside of this performance of
the verification task. The instructions are that, first, a warning light
will occur, then the sentence and the picture will arrive simuita-
neously in two separate panels of the display, then the sentence is
to be read, followed by the picture, and finally the appropriate
button is to be pushed. Each line of the figure is a decision cycle
(dc), numbered consecutively, followed by a description of the de-
cision that was made, p (problem space), s (state), o (operator), or g
(goal), followed by the internal identifier of the object (p/94), fol-
lowed by a descriptive name (such as comprehension, for the com-
prehension problem space). The occurrence of an impasse is
marked by a right double arrow (as at dc 9) and the trace is then
indented until the impasse is resolved, at which point it is outdented
{at de 43).

Soar starts in the base space, which is also the comprehension
problem space. This is where it reads in words by repeatedly ex-
ecuting a read-word operator. The first word is the warning light (at
de 3) and it has to apply an install-node operator to link up the input
into the present state so it can access it. Soar needs to understand
what has come in, so it executes the comprehend operator on it
(de 6). This leads it to execute an intend operator that says to
attempt the pending task (do-c&c-sf), which is the Chase and Clark
task that involves looking at the sentence first and then at the pic-
ture. This operator leads to a no-change impasse, which leads to a
subgoal to implement the intention (g222 at de 9). The problem
space for that is do-c&c, and the initial state is 5224.

The first operator applied is get-input on the sentence channel (de
12), since Soar knows to read the sentence first ¢All of the interac-
