unit of behavior is the use of a problem space, and the analysis is in
terms of patterns of problem spaces.

Each triangle in the figure is a problem space, with the arrows
indicating that one space is a subspace of the other, arising through
an impasse in the space at the tail of the arrow. For instance, P is a
prediction space. It contains prediction operators, which predict
whether the balance beam will tilt down on the left, balance, or tilt
down on the right. Soar performs the actual task of predicting the
balance beam in the P space. All of the other spaces arise out of
impasses that start in the P space. The figure shows three separate
trials. On each trial, Soar is presented a specific balance beam and
asked to make a prediction. Let’s give an overview of what occurs
in the sequence, and then come back and go through the detail.

The first trial, in the left-hand column, gets things started. To
begin with, Soar does not even have a prediction operator for doing
the task. Hence, it must build itself a prediction operator. It is not
given feedback to know whether it is right or wrong, but it is able to
