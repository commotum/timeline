Repeat back: RCA, CBS, APA

If the person knew the three-letter abbreviations, then the sequence _
would be easy to remember, although the person would have to
decode RCA (the chunk) to R, C, A, when providing the output. At
some earlier time the RCA chunk was created from a set of existing
chunks, R, C, and A, which themselves had been formed yet ear-
lier. If, for instance, RCA and CBS had featured jointly in the news,
say some prominent executive moving from RCA to CBS, the per-
son might have formed yet a higher chunk, (RCA, CBS). Or the
person might form such a chunk deliberately for himself. Thus,
chunking is recursive—memory becomes organized hierarchically.

Much experimental evidence exists that chunking goes on all the
time. For instance (McLean & Gregg, 1967), people can learn to
recite a permutation of the alphabet:

Repeat back: GK MZIFOBXLINPRCUSQTVWEAY

The sequence was presented to some people in groups of two and to
others in groups of three:

GK MZ IF OB XL JN PRCU SQ TV WE AY
GKM ZIF OBX LJN PRC USQ TVW EAY

The string is learned either way, though it takes quite a few repeti-
tions, and it can be recited smoothly. But if (surprise!) people who
learned the list in subgroups are asked to recite the sequence back-
wards, then the chunking is revealed. They can recite backwards,
but they produce the sequence in little bursts of letters. They recol-
fect each chunk as a unit, unpack the chunk into working memory
(which arrives in forward order), and then invert the order for the
small sequence. They recite the list as YA, EW, VT, ... or YAE,
WVT, ..., depending on how they learned it. This experiment is
particularly revealing because it demonstrates actual chunk for-
mation. The units of twos and threes certainly did not exist before-
hand.

Although the concept of chunking is well established and well
known in cognitive science as a form of memory organization, it has
generally played second fiddle to other concepts for the organiza-
tion of long-term memory, such as semantic nets, frames, and
schemas. The reasons are not entirely clear. My own conjecture is
that operational systems were built using semantic nets, frames,
