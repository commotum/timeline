Unified Theories of Cognition = 41

technology, on the one hand, but is capable of intelligent action, on
the other—does this provide constraints on a theory of human cog-
nition? It turns out that it does.

Chapter 4 contains the full detail of the architecture that will be
our candidate cognitive architecture, namely Soar. This architec-
ture will, naturally enough, abide by the constraints revealed in
Chapter 3. The chapter will focus on the structure of that architec-
ture and how it manages intelligent action. The chapter ends by
showing how Soar maps into human cognition.

The next three chapters will range over different domains of cog-
nition, showing how Soar provides a unified treatment. Chapter 5
will start with immediate behavior—tasks that go from presentation
to completion in just a second or two. Chapter 6 covers learning,
memory, and skill acquisition—behavior that cuts across the time
dimension. Chapter 7 moves up to tasks that take long enough so
the system can attain modest degrees of rationality, namely tasks of.
the order of minutes and more.

Finally, Chapter 8 explores the frontier that separates what Soar
can currently treat, in at least modestly concrete terms, and what is
still pure speculation. A unified theory of cognition must indeed be
able to address the full range of cognition, even if the actual investi-
gation is still to be done. It is important at least to ask what ap-

’ proach would be indicated for such areas as language and develop-

ment, and what the relation could be to the bordering system
layers, neurophysiology below and social science above. Then,
having made these few probes of the frontier, we bring the case to
a close.
