each experimental result. This approach accepts this limitation and
treats the analyzed experiments as a very large set of simultaneous
constraints on the constants. The yield is the adoption of values
that produce relatively good results across the breadth of behavior,
including estimates of variability and indications of functional vari-
ation in the constants. The attempt to determine the constants is not
a one-time affair but a continuous activity. Indeed, this activity
could become a major indicator of the scope and the accuracy of a
given unified theory.

Coming back to the enterprise of this chapter, we wish to illus-
trate how Soar can be used to make predictions at the immediate-
response level. The previous analysis has identified three or four
constants that enter into the formulation. The perceptual module,
the minimal operator, and the motor module form a set of three. If
encoding and decoding productions also occur, then we need the
production cycle as well. In the latter case, we could take the
decision procedure as another constant and then derive the minimal
operator as two production cycles and two decisions; this provides
an alternative set of four. :

We do not wish to engage in a mini-version of the parameter-
setting exercise described above. Even initial attempts should be
done against the background of the sort of analysis we are about to
commence, so it would put the cart before the horse to set them by
some form of data analysis before we start. Instead, we simply
stipulate a set of values in round 10 ms terms (Figure 5-6). This set
will turn out to be fairly close to the mark for the several experi-
mental paradigms we will discuss. These constants may be viewed
in one of two ways, and it probably doesn’t make much difference
which. First, they can be viewed as if they were established by an
analysis of a set of independent experiments. Then they are indeed
constants for the purposes of the analyses to come. Alternatively,
they can be viewed as if they were determined jointly by the set of
experiments to be described. Since quite a few experiments are
