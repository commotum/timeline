ing the cryptarithmetic operators, it might have been a long time
before we ever got to simulating the search-control behavior.

We used syllogisms to ask whether there were limits to rational-
ity other than time. Syllogisms provide a good test of this question
because, although they are relatively simple and short tasks, some
instances turn out to be quite difficult, even for intelligent people.
In general, the answer is that the difficulty lies in the formulation of
the task. This is not primarily a question of encoding rules (though
such effects exist, as the individual data showed). It comes from the
use of a representation (models) that trades away representational
power for speed of processing. Categorical syllogisms, for which
quantifiers are used, reveal the limitations. Processing strategies
exist that permit adequate performance even so, but these are com-
plex (generating and examining multiple modets) and, importantly,
the tasks are presented without feedback or other instructions that
would permit correct performance to be discovered. In terms of
simulation, the interesting aspect of the syllogism story was having
to build the theory practically on the fly. We essentially backed into
our theory by simulating a version that was already direct, in the
sense that it was done directly by productions, and then we backed
into the spaces that were the deliberate spaces that would yield the
chunked space with experience. This latter space was the one that
turned out to have the interesting structure.

In the sentence-verification task, we tried to explain where
executive-level flowcharts come from. We presented a theory that
eliminated flowcharts as a structure with direct psychological valid-
ity and that showed them as static composite projections of dynami-
cally generated behavior in problem spaces. The ultimate point—
much more important, in fact—is that instructions and task
performance need to be brought together in one theory. That is both
an obligation of a unified theory of cognition and an opportunity for
it. We were able to illustrate that Soar can approach this capability.
From a simulation point of view, the lesson here is just the opposite
of the usual one of trying to cope with complexity. The situations
represented by sentence verification are quite simple. Conse-
quently, the problem is how to be clear that the conclusions are
being generated by the theory and not by the intuitive rationality of
the analyst. The flowcharts that fill our psychological journals can
stand as typical opportunities for smuggling in the implicit rational-
