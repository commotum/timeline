Unified Theories of Cognition = 23

This activity retains a decided Popperian flavor that falsifiabitity is
next to godliness. Theories are not to be treated as a tool to be used
for some externally given purpose, where happiness is an answer
sufficient unto the day thereof. Thus theories become objects of
discrimination. The alternative is to treat theories as objects of
approximation. Approximation is the natural state for a unified the-

‘ ory, because the pressure is to fit in the best story that science can

tell at the present moment. One therefore approximates, and tags
on notes about anomalies, conclusions that should follow instead,
and so on. Shifting from discriminating to approximating would be a
beneficial change for the development of pure psychological theory.

Finally, a unified theory solves a rather specific methodological
problem about simulations—the irrelevant-specification problem.
It has long been a complaint about computer simulations of cogni-
tive processes that they force the stipulation of large numbers of
assumptions, ‘‘just to make the simulation run” (Reitman, 1965).
What aspects of a program actually make psychological claims?
The difficulty of separating the psychologically relevant from the
adventitious has become a stock form of criticism of simulation
results. But if one has a truly unified theory, which lays out the
entire structure of human cognition, this complaint goes away. The
theory comes closer to specifying all of the details of the simulation,
which is to say, all that is needed to make the simulation run. There
is no large collection of psychologically unmotivated programs and
data structures,

To summarize, the items listed in Figure 1-6 are the sorts of
benefits | would hope for—indeed, expect—from a unified theory
of cognition. It is a sizable budget of benefits and, of course, psy-
chology will get only what it pays for. Which is to say that unified
theories, as all science, require a lot of work and will not happen
just by wishing for them—or writing books in praise of them.

1.3. Is Psychology Ready for Unified Theories?

Itis relevant to ask ‘“‘why now?" Why should psychology strive for
unified theories of cognition in the 1990s, rather than the early 1970s
or the beginning of the new century, a comfortable decade away?

One relevant observation ts the rise of cognitive science. The
cognitive revolution is now into its fourth decade—it is over thirty
years old. At some point we must stop talking about it like it was a
