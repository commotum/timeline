412.0 Unified Theories of Cognition

These experiments—and there was a small cottage industry in
producing them in the 1970s (Clark & Clark, 1977)—-provided an
important part of the growing evidence that humans behave in
highly lawful ways on truly cognitive tasks. The tasks that began
the chronometric revolution in the 1960s were simple perceptual
and memory-search tasks (Neisser, 1967). We examined one of
these in Chapter 5, the Sternberg paradigm (Sternberg, 1966). The
sentence-verification tasks moved up a ways in task complexity (as
can be seen in going from ~1 sec to ~2-3 sec). More important,
they engaged linguistic behavior, which occupies such a special role
in our notion of higher mental! processes. This paradigm thus played
an important role in the early 1970s in building up the large body of
regularities that have confirmed that humans are computational sys-
tems. It contributed its quota to our ~~3,000 regularities.

The style of theorizing about the information processing in these
tasks was by means of flowcharts (as shown in the figure). Any
psychologist can testify to the ubiquitous occurrence of such flow-
charts throughout the cognitive literature. They provide the frame-
work for analysis and discussion of the particular aspects that are
being manipulated in an experiment. The interpretation of the up-
per flowchart goes like this. First (before entering the flowchart
proper), the person reads the sentence and encodes it internally as a
proposition. Then the person examines the picture and encodes the
information from it as another internal proposition. This second
encoding occurs because the two items of knowledge (from the
sentence and from the picture) must be put in some common repre-
sentational terms in order to permit comparison. Here the codes
can be represented as (plus (above star)) for the sentence and (plus
{above star)) for the picture. Before starting the actual comparison,
an index is set for the expected answer (here, that the response will
be true, because the default norm is for a sentence to be true).
Given this setup, the flowchart in the figure shows the way the
comparison proceeds. First, the subjects of the two codes are com-
pared. If they match, processing simply proceeds. But if they fail to
match, then the response index is changed (from true to false).
Neat, the ‘outer strings’’ are compared, which is the way the origi-
nal article referred to the relation (above or below). Again, if the
