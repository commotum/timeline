struct the symbolic object that is desired, Here, the task is, starting
at the initial state (st), with blocks B and C on the table and A on
top of B, to construct a desired state (s4), with A on top of B on top
of C. When operating in a problem space, the system is always
located at some current state. It can apply any of the operators of
the problem space to the current state. The figure shows three
operators, of, 02, and 03, as possible operators to be applied to the
initial state. These operators correspond to the moves of the vari-
ous blocks: operator a1 moves block A to atop C, 02 moves A to the
table, 03 moves C to atop A. This problem space is useful for
solving problems in the blocks world precisely because there is a
representation law that relates what the operators do to the data
structure that is the current state and what real moves do to real
blocks in the external world.

Operating in the problem space requires knowledge, both to im-
plement the operators and to guide the search. This knowledge is
held in the fong-term memory of the system and it is brought to bear
on the current state. (Thus, the figure actually shows the current
state to be 52, which occurs after Operator o1 has been applied to
the initial state 51.) The long-term memory holds the knowledge to
implement and guide searching through all the problem spaces of
which the system is capable; a search of this long-term memory is
required to find the knowledge that is relevant to this space and this
current state. This is knowledge search and it is distinct from the
problem-space search of applying operators to a state to construct
new states. In particular, the knowledge search is through a physi-
caily existing memory, whereas the problem-space search gener-
ates the states one by one, so that only a single state exists physi-
cally at any one time.!

Every cognitive task that Soar does is represented by a problem
space. Therefore, the primitive functions that Soar must perform
are those that determine how it wil] Operate with problem spaces.
These are listed in the figure. They are to select a problem space to
work in, to select a state within that problem space (if more than
one is available), to select an operator of the space to apply to the
selected state, and then to apply that operator to the state to take a

t, Old states, which have been generated, can of course be saved in some memory,
for retrieval later; but this does not change the character of the problem space as being
generated, state by state, rather than having all its states Preexisting in physical space,
