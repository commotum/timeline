immediate Behavior ® 263

of the scheme itself. Depending on the specifics of the task, some
operations can be performed prior to the occurrence of the stimulus
{at P) by suitable preparation. Since adequate and appropriate
preparation is assumed, these possibilities are important in deter-
mining the behavior.

Let us go through the sequence, defining the functions and why
they are necessary. We will assume the paradigm immediate-
response task: a stimulus is presented, the person must imme-
diately produce a response that is some direct function of the
stimulus. We will also note factors that affect the duration required
to perform the function and the possibility of preparation, which
could remove the function entirely from the analysis.

Perceiving the stimulus must occur first. The architecture pro-
vides no alternative to this being done by P, the perceptual module.
P runs autonomously and is not modified by experience (it could
also be said to be impenetrable). Thus, its duration is uncontrolled
by central cognition. The duration is a function of specific stimulus
properties. For instance, as stimulus intensity goes up, the percep-
tion time goes down.

Encoding occurs next, a process of perceptual parsing that pro-
duces a representation of the stimulus in task-independent terms.
This is a comprehension function that is obligatory, given the struc-
ture of the architecture. It is composed of a sequence of production
executions, whose duration is simply the sum of the serial chain of
E-productions that fire. Duration will increase with the complexity
of the stimulus, However, just detecting that a stimulus is there
requires no encoding at all (with suitable preparation). The arrival
of the stimulus elements from P can be enough for the system to
trigger further responses.

Attend is the operator that brings cognition to focus on the
stimulus element. The duration associated with attend has several
functionally necessary components. For voluntary attention, there
may be a delay prior to selection of attend, measured from when the
stimulus element is available in working memory. Such a delay
would be absent for an interruption. There must be a search for the
stimulus elements, though this is likely to require an essentially
fixed duration, since all of the usual problems associated with
search (choice of directions, rejection of candidates, and the like)
occur at the level of a decision cycle. It is important to note that
preparation may be possible so that attend need not occur at ail.
