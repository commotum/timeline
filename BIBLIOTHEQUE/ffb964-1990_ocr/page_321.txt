chunks, the recognize-retrieval units of the memory, which are
formed by immediate goal experience—the features with which we
have become familiar. This assertion is probably the most conten-
tious aspect of Soar, in the view of the AI field, which is where Soar
got its start. Soar is seen as an interesting system and chunking as
an interesting learning mechanism, but it is hardly the only learning
mechanism around, The field is currently investigating lots of differ-
ent kinds of learning (see the journal, Machine Learning) and it is
believed, generally speaking, that many different learning mecha-
nisms will be developed for many different situations. Chunking is
seen as one mechanism located in the corner of the space of learn-
ing mechanisms that are low level and unintelligent. (Intelligence
here is measured by the amount of knowledge and analysis that
goes into creating a specific addition to the performance system.)
Thus, from an AI standpoint, the assertion that chunking is a
sufficient mechanism should be considered a speculative and a
priori unlikely hypothesis. I share some of this assessment, and I
would not be unduly surprised to see the assertion overturned.
Chunking could become only one of several mechanisms in a gen-
eral intelligence. However, the indications from our experience on
Soar so far are certainly all in the direction of supporting this hy-
pothesis.

The third assertion is the functionality of short-term memory
(STM). Short-term memory arises because of functional require-
ments. Ail architectures bring together elements out of which be-
havior is composed. A memory is needed to hold these elements
and keep them assembled together. This is functionally a working
memory and this is what it is called in Soar. By its nature, a working
memory is temporary, since it must change at a rate commensurate
with the rate of operations. Thus, this memory will give rise to
short-term memory effects. Other sources of short-term memory
effects might be other functional aspects of the total architecture,
especially those involved with perception and motor action, where
timing constraints are important. The current Soar architecture is
entirely functional—all of its mechanisms and structures exist to
provide functionality. No mechanisms or structures in Soar have
been posited just to produce some empirically known effects. It is
entirely possible that short-term memory effects in humans arise
from timitations of the underlying neural technology that has no
relation to functionality at all. To exhibit these effects, Soar would
