would be generated. This would lead to a tie impasse and into a
selection space to decide which one to attend to first. Immediate
search control might tell right away which is the most likely hy-
pothesis. Otherwise, the whole apparatus of problem solving for
selection could be evoked to help choose which interpretation to
pursue first.

In this case, with {check > (obj)J dara the only choice, Soar is able
to move on to execute the [interpret] operator. This operator goes
back into the comprehension space and proceeds to permit firing of
whatever comprehension operators can fire. Check can fire im-
mediately. It has an associated data structure, which interpret
knows defines a comprehension operator that’s supposed to be ap-
plied to the word check. Soar goes into a further subspace and fires
an apply-operator. This operator actually interprets the data struc-
ture in terms of matching the requisite elements and producing
instantiated results—in effect it simulates production matching and
execution.

Execution of the operator by interpreting it leads to the creation
of a chunk. This chunk is exactly what would have been in the
comprehension operator for check, if that operator had been built
by hand (the way the one for plus was in fact built). Thus, Soar has
actually learned a new comprehension operator.

Soar continues after the execution of the apply-operator (the
chunking being a side effect). The comprehension operator for fis}
can now execute, since the (interpreted) operator for check put
{obj} into working memory. Soar does not go back and reinterpret
the whole sentence; it just proceeds to interpret what it doesn’t
comprehend again until it’s satisfied. Thus the trace ends when
Soar returns to the state it was in, prepared to comprehend the next
sentence.

So far, all that has happened is that the definition of check as an
object has been created. Soar hasn’t linked check with the / in the
figure. That missing link would not be discovered in the midst of
interpreting the sentence. Rather, it would be found in the context
of attempting the rest of the task, that is, in comparing the compre-
hension structure from the sentence with the comprehension struc-
ture from picture. Then Soar would find two items being compared
that were not just unequal, but disparate. It would then be in a
position to generate a hypothesis that the object the word stands for
is the mark in the picture. Once that was linked up, the result would
