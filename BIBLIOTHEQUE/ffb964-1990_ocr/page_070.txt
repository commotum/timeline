on how to represent things in logical calculi. Much of the difficulty
turns out to be that we don’t understand what we want to represent,
not that we can’t find first-order ways of doing it. Another part of
the difficulty is that the Tepresentation is often very awkward and
indirect. Thus much research goes into finding alternative forms of
logics (model logics, higher-order logics, sorted logics) that are
easier to use or more perspicuous.

We can become clearer about what is involved in representation
by pursuing how else we might represent our simple blocks world.
The general situation is shown in Figure 2-6. There is an external
world in which the blocks world occurs, In this example an action is
taken (the transformation T} that moves the block 4 from atop
block B to atop block C.° Besides the external world, there is the

6. I could have remained faithful to the prior example of whether block B was clear,
but it would have been somewhat confusing, because it involves a change only in the
knowing agent, not in the world.
