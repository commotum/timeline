Memory, Learning, and Skill

6

In Chapter 5 we focused on the simplest of behaviors, such as
pressing a button in response to a clear stimulus. We treated these
behaviors as pure performances—as if the human was not changed
at all in doing these tasks. But that of course is not so. Humans
learn continuously from all tasks they perform, at whatever scale
the tasks occur. As our candidate unified theory of cognition, Soar
must address the phenomena of memory, learning, and skill, as well
as the immediate-response tasks of Chapter 5.

First let us be clear about our terminology (see Figure 6-1).
Learning is not exactly a term of art, but is used quite broadly. As
behaviorism amply demonstrated, it can be used in a way that
avoids positing a memory. If the memories of a system are
identifiable, however, it is useful to refer to learning with respect to
each memory. Where there is a memory, there is also a set of
functions for using it: the acquisition of knowledge by this memory
and the retrieval of knowledge from the memory, to which access is
required to determine what is retrieved. The term learning usually
refers to the acquisition side, but people are not usually considered
to have learned something unless, under some circumstances, they
can access and retrieve the learned knowledge from the memory
and use it in a response. It thus tends to be used to stand for the
entire process (which is the way the figure shows it).

This chapter covers all of memory (with the associated learn-
ing)—short-term and long-term memory, procedural (skill) memory
and declarative memory, episodic and semantic memory. We will
start with Soar’s theory of memory and learning, and see how it is
to cover all of these. This will lead us to something called data
chunking, which relates to episodic memory. Then we will talk
about skill acquisition and, finally, short-term memory.
