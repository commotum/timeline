Human Cognitive Architecture = 113

ment on the risk at the end of, the chapter, after the results are
before us. Even if the speculations are wrong, they can be wrong in
revealing ways.

Here is a preview of the results, as a guide for where we are
going. Different cognitive worlds have different time scales. The
different kinds of cognitive worlds that we see are governed by
the time scales on which they occur—the neurological, cognitive,
rational, and social. They have the character they do to enable
mind-like behavior to emerge—to get to computational, symbolic
systems. The temporal region within which cognition proper oper-
ates—about 10 ms to 10 sec—comprises four system levels. Within
this cognitive band there must be a distinction between automatic
and controlled processes, which again is a distinction in level. In
addition, the architecture must be recognition based and there must
be a continual shift toward increased recognition. This shift corre-
sponds to continual movement along the isobar in Figure 2-19 to-
ward increased preparation.

3.1. The Human Is a Symbol System

Chapter 2 was abstract in a very particular way. It discussed
symbol-level systems and knowledge-level systems as the general
structure that was necessary to obtain general intelligent behavior.
It did not specifically make the case that humans were knowledge-
level systems and symbol systems—-though it was clearly under-
stood that was what we were after. Rather, we settled for under-
standing the nature of these various systems, and what gives rise to
them, namely, the need to deal with large amounts of variability in
response functions.

At this point I wish to be explicit that humans are symbol systems
that are at least modest approximations of knowledge systems.
They might be other kinds of systems as weil, but at least they are
symbol systems. The grounds for this argument, as made clear by
the entire previous chapter, is the variety of response functions that
humans use. If the variety of response functions is immense
enough, a system will be driven to compose its response functions
by means of a computational system that constructs representa-
tions by means of composed transformations; and it will be driven
to use symbols to obtain distal access in its long-term memory. That
