2.1. Behaving Systems

I want to take mind to be the control system that guides the behav-
ing organism in its complex interactions with the dynamic real
world. So, Figure 2-1 shows the environment behaving through
time and the organism behaving through time, with a series of in-
teractions between the two. Although single transactions can be
isolated analytically—where the environment presents and the or-
ganism responds, or vice versa—these transactions are embedded
in a sequence such that each becomes part of the context within
which further actions follow. The mind then is simply the name we
give to the control system that has evolved within the organism to
carry out the interactions to the benefit of that organism or,
ultimately, for the survival of its species,

Whatever higher point of view might also be valid, mind can be
seen to provide response functions. That is, the organism takes
actions as a function (in the mathematical sense) of the environ-
ment. If the environment is different, the organism can behave
differently, even with the same response function. That is what it
means to be in interaction. However, many different response func-
tions occur as the organism goes through time. During the period
labeled A in the figure the organism behaves with one response
function, during B with another, during C with yet another. There
are different response functions in different kinds of situations.

Imagine yourself going through a day. There is one response
function when you get yourself out of bed, one when you reach for
your clothes, one when you face yourself in the mirror, another
when you go to breakfast and talk to your spouse, another when
you get in your car and drive to work. Each of those situations is
radicaily different and each calls for a quite different function about
how to respond with respect to the environment. One involves
beds, floors, and covers; another involves mirrors and faucets; an-

problem spaces, and preparation and deliberation—formed the initial segment of lecture
3. Here, all the foundational material is putled into one chapter, making it longer and the
next one consequently shorter.
