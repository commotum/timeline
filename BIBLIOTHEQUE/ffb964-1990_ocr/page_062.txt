used. As a level, it has a medium, namely, knowledge. It has a law
of behavior, namely, if the system wants to attain goal G and knows
that to do act A will attain G, then it will do A. This law is a simple
form of rationality—that an agent will operate in its own best inter-
ests according to what it knows.

As just another level in the hierarchy of Figure 2-3, there is
nothing special about the knowledge level, in any foundational or
philosophical sense. Of course, the knowledge level is certainly
different from all the other levels. It has its own medium and its
own laws and these have their own peculiarities. But, equally, each
of the other levels is different from all the others, each with its own
peculiarities. The levels can, of course, also be classified in various
ways, such as discrete versus continuous, or sequential versus par-
allel. But the classification is not very important, compared with the
individual particularity of each level, in how it describes a system
and what are the characteristic modes of analysis and synthesis that
go with it so that it can be used effectively.

Descriptive schemes like the one put forth in Figure 2-3 do not
carry with them obvious scientific claims. They seem to be simply
ways of describing parts of nature. However, they are far from
theoretically neutral. Scientific claims arise when we discover (or
assert) that such a descriptive scheme can actually be used success-
fully, or with such and such a degree of approximation, for a given
real system or type of system. The criterion for success is that the
system is operationally complete—its behavior is determined by
the behavior laws, as formulated for that level, applying to its state,
as described at that level. The claim is that abstraction to the par-
ticular level involved still preserves all that is relevant for future
behavior described at that level of abstraction. The force of such
claims can be appreciated easily enough by imagining someone
handing you a small closed box and asserting, ‘There is a pro-

| grammable computer inside.” This means you will find something

inside that can be successfully described as a programmable com-
puter, so that you may treat it so, expecting to be able to program it,
execute it with a loaded program, and so on. Taking the abstraction
as given and acting on your expectations, you would be in for one
successful prediction after another (or failure thereof) about a re-
gion of the world you hitherto had not known.

Thus, to claim that humans can be. described at the knowledge
level is to claim there is a way of formulating them as agents that
