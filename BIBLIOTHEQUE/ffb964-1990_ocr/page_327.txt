Figure 6-5, Learning from external example
{Golding, Rosenbloom, & Laird, 1987).

Figure 6-5 shows a case of learning from an illustrative example,
using the same simple algebra task. Again, there is the initial tie
impasse; again, the selection problem space to resolve it; again, the
tie impasse on how to proceed with the evaluation; again, the ad-
vise problem space to ask for guidance. This time the request is for
the advisor to give another example task to solve. There is addi-
tional activity (the wavy line) to input the new equation and the
variable to solve for. Then Soar tries to solve the new equation, r =
sly, for y. The figure doesn’t detail the activity to do this. It could
solve it by brute force, or by getting further advice, or whatever. In
any event, in so doing some chunks get built. Those chunks transfer
to the original space. That is, the chunks that summarize the selec-
tion of operators that solve the illustrative example also apply to
select the operators in the original task.

These two examples show that knowledge can enter the system
from outside by chunking, in one case by advice about which
operator to evaluate first, and in the other case by an example to
try. Chunking is playing the role of a knowledge-transfer mecha-
nism. This is a perfectly reasonable way of looking at learning, even
if not the usual one. It makes learning look analogous to a data link
in a communication system. The key is the transfer of learning (that
is, generalization), rather than the compilation effect for more
efficient repetition. Chunking is also playing the role of assimilator.
