in the future. Each of these descriptions provides a different way to
make predictions about system behavior.

A clarification is in order. All along, I keep referring to predic-
tions. This is simply shorthand for all the various uses of descrip-
tions, such as explaining behavior, controlling behavior, or con-
structing something that behaves to specifications. Afthough there
are differences in these activities and some descriptions are more
suited to one than the other, it becomes tiresome to have to be
explicit each and every time. “‘Prediction’’ will cover them all.

The descriptions of computer systems form a hierarchy of levels,
because each higher-level description is both an abstraction and a
specialization of the one below it. Consider the level of electrical
circuits. Its medium, current, is the flow of electrons. Its laws,
Ohm's and Kirchhoff's, can be derived from electromagnetic the-
ory, specialized to networks of conductors. Or consider the pro-
gram level. Data structures are sets of bit vectors, to be interpreted
in fixed ways by various operations. The operations can be de-
scribed as the outcomes of specific register-transfer systems, as can
the interpretation of a program data structure that determines
which operations are executed. Each level abstracts from many
details of the level below,

Systems become more specialized as the hierarchy is ascended.
Not every system describable as an electrical circuit is also describ-
able as a logic circuit. Not every system describable as a register-
transfer system is a programmable system. The relationships be-
tween the levels are sometimes quite transparent, as is the simple
aggregation that connects the logic level to the register-transfer
level, where bits are simply organized into vectors of fixed length
and handled in a uniform way, except for a few special operations
{such as addition and multiplication, with their carries), Sometimes
the relationships are less obvious. Inventing electrical circuits that
behaved discretely according to the laws of Boolean logic required
a rather substantial evolution, mediated by the work on pulse sys-
tems for radar,

Knowledge systems are just another level within this same hier-
archy, another way to describe a system. As a level in the hier-
archy, knowledge is above the program level in Figure 2-3. The
knowledge level abstracts completely from the internal processing
and the internal representation. Thus, all that is left is the content of
the representations and the goals toward which that content will be
