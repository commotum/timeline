decades, the operational behavior of the neuron is rather well un-
derstood in terms of cable equations in branching networks (Rall,
1977).5 Current theory covers not only pulses and graded potentials
but also summation, inhibition, and the other integrative effects.
Thus, at the neural level there are strong behavior laws.

We need only two facts out of this wealth of detail. First, the
characteristic operating time is ~~1 ms. In the figure, the width of
the neural spike is about 1-2 ms, even fora sharp pulse. This is the

5. There are other forms of behavior of the neuron that are much slower (also, less
well understood), for instance, the transport functions that move transmitter supplies
down the axon to the vesicles, whose rates are in the range of millimeters per day.
