struct in cognitive sciences, fit into Soar? This question is an in-
stance of a question that needs to be answered repeatedly by any
unified theory of cognition. How do schemas fit? How does activa-
tion fit? How do grammars, transformational, lexical-functional,
and otherwise, fit? In sum, how does any construct fit that has
proved to have strong explanatory power in cognitive science and is
not a direct part of the Soar theory?

Taking such questions seriously may seem antithetical to the
stance implied by paradigms in the sense of Kuhn (1962), namely,
that a new paradigm presumably asks new questions, unasked by
the old paradigm, and ignores the old questions. On the contrary,
this serves to emphasize that a unified theory of cognition is not like
a new paradigm. The function of a unified theory is to integrate and
synthesize existing knowledge within the existing paradigm, not to
propose new questions and radically different answers. Or, if one
feels that cognitive psychology is not yet a paradigm science—
seeming too scrappy perhaps—then the function of a unified theory
is to precipitate and consolidate a paradigm from the saturated solu-
tion of empirical results and successful microtheories that currently
exist.

The answer to the question is straightforward. Mental models are
put forward as what are manipulated in solving a problem. Hence,
they must just be the representation of the state in the problem
space. They do not add any new entity to what is currently in Soar.
However, they do specialize the nature of the state representa-
tion—namely, that it shall be an annotated model, rather than a
propositional representation or some other type of representation.
Along with this restriction comes corresponding specializations of
the operators in problem spaces to respect the semantics of such
representations.

Interestingly, this has not been the view in the mental-models
world, where mental models have been considered an alternative to
problem spaces. Actually, what the literature on mental models
shows is that problem spaces and heuristic search are simply absent
(Gentner & Stevens, 1983; Johnson-Laird, 1983). This is a little
surprising, given the obvious relation between mental models and
problem spaces just described. Much of the basic work in heuristic
search in Al—the source of the notion of problem spaces—has
always used models for state representations—toy tasks (Mission-
aries and Cannibals, Tower of Hanoi), chess programs, spatial lay-
