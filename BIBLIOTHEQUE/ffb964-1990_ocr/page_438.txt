memory is. The task of accomplishing storage is a version of data
chunking—there is a data structure that needs to show up as the
actions of some to-be-created productions, such that it can be re-
called at a later time as a function of some cues available then, but
this data structure itself must not be part of the conditions of these
productions or the productions can never be evoked. (More accu-
rately, they can be evoked only when the data structure is already
in working memory.) And indeed the mechanisms used to do this
chunking are essentially the same ones used in data chunking.

When the first instance arises to perform the new task—here, the
sentence-verification task—what Soar has available are these data
chunks. Upon being evoked, the chunks produce in working mem-
ory a reconstructed version of the data structures. To perform the
task the first time, though, Soar must interpret these data struc-
tures—by using problem spaces with operators (how else could it
be done?). As a result, when the interpretation succeeds, new
chunks are built that perform this task. On subsequent perform-
ances of the task of sentence verification, these productions di-
rectly implement the problem space and operators. Thus, Soar
moves to acquire the task by passing through a stage of interpreta-
tion. In simple cases, such as the sentence-verification task used
here, Soar acquires on a single pass exactly the productions that
would have been (and were) produced by hand to do the task.2° On
more complex tasks, however, the single experience provides only
a single swath through the possibilities of task performance, so later
performances will be a mixture of chunked and interpreted behav-
ior. The basic scheme works in Soar, in its present incarnation, ina
collection of problem spaces called TAQ (Yost, 1988).

This form of skill acquisition, which passes from declarative
structure to productions by means of interpretation, is a central
tenet of the Act* theory of skill acquisition (Anderson, 1981, 1983).
Thus, Soar uses the same acquisition scheme as Act* does, It does
so, of course, entirely by means of the chunking mechanism and
problem spaces, and this method integrates it into the rest of Soar.
Thus, again, what we see arising in a unified theory of cognition is a
convergence of mechanisms. Given that Act* is another candidate

20. Actually, the runs were made with chunking at alf levels; if bottom-up chunking
had been used, it would have taken several nins to learn all these productions,
