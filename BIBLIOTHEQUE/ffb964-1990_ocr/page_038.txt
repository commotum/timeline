Unified Theories of Cognition = 25

There are, of course, less social indices of progress. For me,
| the important one is the massive body of beautiful, detailed data
| that experimental cognitive psychology has accumulated. I was im-
| pressed with it in 1972, when I wrote the twenty-questions paper

(Newell, 1973a); it has only continued to grow in both volume and
: quality. It is mostly about immediate-response behavior—down
‘ where the mind's work shows through. This is exactly what is
needed to understand how mind is constructed. What has grown up
is not just data, but large numbers of regularities, many parametric
: and robust, plus quite a lot of theory, most of it local to some small
‘ body of data. An indicator of current progress is the recently pub-
lished Handbook on Human Perception and Performance (Boff,
Kaufman, & Thomas, 1986) in two large volumes. I recommend it
as a survey of what is now known and of the extent to which this
" knowledge can be systematized. It begins to approximate the classi-
cal ideal of a scientific handbook set by the great Handbuch der
Physik. It is still short on global theory, but the amount of local
theory is impressive.

The extent and elegance of the growing body of data has not
erased the concerns of the twenty-questions paper (Newell, 1973a).
If anything, my concerns are doubled by the addition of a new one.
Will the body of important, regular data and first-order regularities
become so large that the task of theoretical integration becomes
overwhelming? This is not an idle question. Prior to scientific inte-
gration, a body of scientific data always presents a collection of
dissonances and apparent contradictions—if it were not so, the
integration would already have occurred. As theoretical activity
confronts the data and the regularities it senses these dissonances.
The puzzle solving required of the theorist is to use the clashes and
gaps to evoke the right insight. It is thus that the more constraint
the better. The theoretician faces a bigger puzzle, but there are
more signposts to guide him, if only he can decode the signs. It is
one thing if there are three or four of these clashes, another if thirty
or forty, and yet another if there are three or four hundred inconsis-
tencies. Then every turn can seem blocked—every signpost has
two others pointing a different way. In my view, it is time to get
going on producing unified theories of cognition—before the data
base doubles again and the number of visible clashes increases by

the square or cube.
