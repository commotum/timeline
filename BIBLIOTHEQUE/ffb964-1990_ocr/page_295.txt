Figure 5-12, SRC Prediction resuits from MHP theory

(John & Newell, 1987).

MHP theory does a 800d job of predicting the time taken to respond
in SRC situations. By the same token, Soar does a similar job,
because it incorporates the MHP theory, though the details will not
be the same.

5.7. Discussion of the Three Analyses

We now have three examples before us: SRT, 2CRT, and SRC. Let
us step back and see what we have been doing. We are taking Soar
