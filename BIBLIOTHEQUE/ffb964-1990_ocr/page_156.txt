Base time for neuron {ms} Growth factor per system level

Figure 3-10. Nomograph for sensitivity analysis of scaling assumptions.

Its intersections with the isolines gives the ordinate to be used, if
assuming a | ms base time. Thus, as the horizontal dashed line
indicates, a I sec base time intersects the level 3 systems at a scale
factor of 10, which is what our analysis has shown.'4

Any combination of base times, scale factors, system levels, and
critical time limits for behavior can be read off the figure, as well as
ranges of base times and scale factors. For example, the stippled

toc)¥tem "eel to make all four quantities apparent. The display is based on log(time) =

taken to have its own scale factor, the scale factor in the figure should be the geometricat
average of the scale factors.
