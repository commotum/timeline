that the motor system can process. But this will not do. An arbi-
trary language will lead to arbitrariness in the cognitive tasks per-
formed. The issue is precisely not to adopt whatever command
language one wishes, but to find the one used by nature, which will
presumably provide for smooth and rapid transduction of cognitive
command to motor action.

One problem in thinking about this is the limited forms of com-
mand languages used in computer systems, even when extended to
robotics, which are procedure calls (operations with predefined nu-
merical parameters) composed in sequential hierarchical programs.
It is useful to expand the possibilities. Coordinative structures or
synergies (Kelso, 1982) form the motor system of composed dy-
namic systems (Saltzman & Kelso, 1987). For example, the way to
get a finger to move to touch a given place is for the system to set up
a temporary dynamic system that has its equilibrium position where
the finger is supposed to come to rest. Think of it as an assemblage
of springs that comes to rest at the desired landing place. Having
created that dynamic system, the system turns it loose and the
finger automatically homes in at that place. If something disturbs its
trajectory, then self-correcting behavior occurs simply by continu-
ing to move toward the equilibrium point; it is not due to any
feedback-control system that senses the deviation and reacts to it.
This research tradition originates in the work of the Russian Nicolai
Bernstein (Bernstein, 1967). Its focus has not been on charac-
terizing the command language (or even acknowledging an interface
between cognition and the motor system), but on the evidence that
the motor system runs in terms of such coordinative structures.

In this scheme, the command language is the set of specifications
for building composable dynamic systems. The systems themselves
can behave for durations of between ~100 and ~1,000 ms and
longer. The approach accommodates such tasks as handwriting,
which can be seen as a very long term (~~10 sec) advancing,
oscillating system, modulated to give the individual letter shapes
(Hollerbach, 1980). This is in contradistinction to more classically
organized command schemes that have the motor act micro-
managed by the setting and changing of command-parameters
every 10-20 ms.

Coordinative structures are a nice example we can use to enrich
the view of composable systems developed in Chapter 2. There, the
examples of composable transformations obeying representational
