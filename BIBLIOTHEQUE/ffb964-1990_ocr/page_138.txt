time it takes to rise to its peak and come back down. Other pro-
cesses in the neural signal are also ~~1 ms. For example, the time
for graded potentials to move through a dendritic net is ~~1 ms and
the time to make a synaptic transmission is ~~500 us (which is
actually a little less, as appropriate for a component action). Pulse
rates vary accordingly, from high values of ~~200 pulses/sec (cor-
responding to one pulse every ~~5 ms) down to ~~I pulse/sec
(corresponding to one pulse every ~~! sec). As a result, a single
neuron can transmit only a few bits/sec.

The second fact is the speed of neural transmission. The nerve is
specialized for rapid propagation of a neural pulse, and the speed
increases with the diameter of the axonal fiber, The lower panel of
Figure 3-4 shows the speed to be essentially linear in fiber diameter,
and that it can attain speeds of ~~ 100 m/sec in large fibers. Large
fibers occur only in the peripheral nervous system, where large
distances must be covered (~~meters): in the central nervous sys-
tem the fibers are very small and the speeds are ~~1 m/sec.
Specialization for speed is reflected in another technological inno-
vation at the neural level, the myelination of nerve cells, which
improves their speed by an order of magnitude.

From the entire discussion, it should be clear that we are in the
standard realm of physical and chemical law. This is the familiar
physical world, extended to the biological realm. Whatever might
have been the lingering concerns of vitalism in the earlier part of
this century, those concerns are long gone. We understand what is
going on in the biological band by reducing phenomena to bio-
chemistry and biomolecular mechanisms.

3.5. The Neural Circuit Level

We move up to the neural circuit level, that is, to where a collection
of connected neurons together perform some function. Figure 3-5
will have to suffice as a picture. The world is a lot more complicated
up here. Not only are there large numbers of neurons, but our
measuring devices are still not up to multicellular records of the
kind needed—hundreds or thousands of neurons. It is difficult to
get a simple picture, to extract the few important facts needed for
our argument. Nevertheless, here is a simple approximation to
what the current art knows about neural circuits in the central
