106 = Unified Theories of Cognition

human has expertise over many domains. Integrating over these
domains might move the human up on the knowledge axis to about
10° or even 10° chunks but will not increase the size of the search,
since this is relatively fixed by the externally fixed time to respond
(here taken as a few minutes at best) and the rate at which the
architecture does its basic operations, both of which remain con-
stant. Hence, the diagram reveals a characteristic feature, that for a
given system, with its fixed architecture, improvement comes from
adding knowledge, not adding search volume. Thus, systems typi-
cally move up a vertical line as they gain knowledge.

The usefulness of Figure 2-19 for understanding the nature of
intelligent systems can be seen in the story of Hitech.2? This is
the chess-piaying program developed by Hans Berliner and Carl
Ebeling (1988), which now has an official rating in human tourna-
ment play in the high master range (2,360). Hitech is a special
hardware architecture with 64 parallel processors, which generates
about 175,000 chess positions per second. This yields about 10°
situations per move. Hitech is thus a system that operates by mas-
sive search. Like other such programs, Hitech does not use a lot of
knowledge. Initially (1985), it had perhaps tens of rules—a few
general rules such as alpha-beta and some more specific rules for
evaluating positions. This characterization would locate Hitech
over to the far right of the diagram. At this level of performance it
was rated at about 1,900 points, essentially a high expert rating.
Since then its rating has climbed about 400 points. All of that
change occurred, of course, with fixed search capabilities—as
noted, the architecture essentially fixes the size of the search. It
was just as big when Hitech played at 1,900 as it is now when it
plays at 2,350. Thus, Hitech has been moving up a vertical line in
the figure, implying that more knowledge has been pumped into
Hitech. And indeed that is true. Its knowledge is now up to perhaps
a hundred rules. (It is not easy to add knowledge to Hitech, since
it must be applied at the speed of the move generator, which is only
about 5 microseconds per Position.)

22. Indeed, the particular analysis of the trade-off here is due to Hans Berliner,
although of course the general idea has been common knowledge in computer science for
a long time.

23. Hitech is not organized in simple rule-based form and no precise accounting of its
stored knowledge has been attempted,
