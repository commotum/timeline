6.4. Data Chunking

We have been proceeding to read out from Soar the global charac-
teristics of its theory of learning and memory. Unfortunately, there
is a very large fly in this ointment. Figure 6-8 shows the problem.
Assume a paired-associates task, with nonsense syllables (BAJ-
GID). The pair is presented on a study trial. The person knows he is
supposed to study the pair, so that at some later time, when given
BAJ, he can respond with GID.

How will Soar do this task? Soar can learn only by solving prob- —
lems. When presented with instructions for a task, it must pose
itself a problem that wil! result in the kind of learning that it
needs. In this case it must create a task that builds a chunk some-
thing like BAJ — GID. This is Soar’s self-posed task. Let's look at
this situation in the same way we explained chunking in Figure 4-
12, that is, by focusing on working memory as the elements show
up. The exact task that Soar poses for itself, to learn the paired
associate, need not be spelled out. We know, however, that at some
point the critical impasse must take place (indicated by the left-
hand vertical) and that the chunk that resolves the impasse will
be the desired chunk. The requirement for the problem solving for
this impasse (between the two verticals) is to Produce the response
item (GID) plus some preferences that resolve the impasse). Where
