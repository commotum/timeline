space to implement it), or some other impasse. Furthermore, sup-
pose each decision cycle takes on average K production cycles. The
average time to create a chunk is C = 2MKrtp, where 1, is the time
of a production cycle (20 ms). There are 2 extra decision cycles at
the beginning to select the problem space and initial state, but we
can think of this as equivalent to adding an extra initialization
operator. In Chapter 5 we worked with minimal operators (selec-
tion plus execution) for speeded response tasks, which we took to
correspond to the case of K = 1, only a single production cycle per
decision cycle. Simple operators will in general require several pro-
duction cycles, corresponding to K = about 4 or 5. So each chunk
might take on the order of ~200M ms. Soar tasks typically build a
new chunk every 5 or 6 operators (including the initialization
“operator’’), which yields just ~1 chunk per sec. This is a little
faster than the empirical rates but close enough to be in the ball-
park.

The chunking rate is a good example of an approximate constant.
In the long term, the system cannot deviate much from a constant
rate of impasses that is moderately close to the minimum and corre-
sponds to relative constant rates for K and M. When impasses
occur there is a lower limit to the number of operators it takes to
diagnose and resolve an impasse; this puts an upper limit to the
chunking rate. But when impasses do not occur, chunks get built
that substitute for long sequences of simple operators, hence short-
ening the time to the next impasse and raising the chunking rate
until it presses on the upper limit.

(3) Transfer is by identical elements, in the sense that Thorndike
used the term in his theory of transfer (Thorndike, 1903).2 The
identical elements of Thorndike were concrete stimulus-response
associations and were sufficiently hypothetical to not be really
countable. Here they are productions with their abstract conditions
and actions. Abstraction is important, of course, because it permits
the same productions to be evoked in different situations. Indeed,
productions can be seen as the appropriate form for a stimulus-
response theory to take so as to attain universal computability. In

2. Mark Singley and John Anderson have taken this as a theme of their recent book
on transfer (Singley & Anderson, 1989). They use Act* as their theory and, as noted,
Act* productions correspond to Soar operators, not Soar productions; but otherwise the
transfer theory they develop in quantitative detail could be incorporated into Soar in the
same way we have done with the SRC theory in Chapter 5.
