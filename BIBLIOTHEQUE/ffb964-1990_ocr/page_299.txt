increment (the slope of the line) is ~40 ms. This is very fast. For
instance, it is much faster than people can deliberately iterate
through a list in their heads (say counting from 1 to 10), which is
about 130 ms per item (Landauer, 1962),

The third result is what makes behavior on this task seem ex-
traordinary. The strong linearity is prima facie evidence for some
sort of search—given the probe, a check is made of each of the
target items. An obvious consequence is that the slope of the line
should be different for Positive cases (the probe occurs in the list)
and negative cases (the Probe does not occur in the list). In the
negative case the entire list needs to be searched; in the positive
case, the search can stop when the Probe is found—on average,
half-way through the list (assuming suitable randomization, which
experimenters provide). For positive cases the plotted slope against
s should be half that for negative cases (or the same slope if nega-
tives are plotted against s and positives against s/2). As Figure 5-13
shows, however, this does not occur. Instead, the two lines are
exactly parallel. Thus, the sort of terminating search envisioned by
the simple search model could not be taking place. Identical slopes
would be exactly the result, however, if search were exhaustive, if
the entire list had to be searched whether the probe item was found
or not. But there was no particular reason to expect exhaustive
