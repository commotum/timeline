promise being that we should ask how Soar explains these regu-
larities. Typing also provides us with a simple perceptual-motor
skill. Until the total cognitive system is more fully developed, Soar
is limited in its ability to deal with perception and motor behavior.
Typing involves coordination of perception, cognition, and motor
behavior, but it is still simple enough to be analyzed without undue
dependence on perception and motor phenomena. Furthermore,
lots of regularities are at hand—the Salthouse 29. Finally, as it
turns out, typing offers another example of incorporating existing
theory. The initial developments here were the work of John, using
the version of the Model Human Processor (MHP) that she had
applied to stimulus-response compatibility John, 1988). She devel-
oped a detailed theory called the Model of Expert Transcription
Typing (METT). Having established the general way in which SRC
theory maps into Soar, we can simply extend the same analysis to
typing.

Figure 5-17 shows how Soar would type. Soar would get the next
word, get the spelling of the word, get a letter within the spelling,
and then issue the command for a keystroke to type the letter. This
is a straightforward way of typing, given that the words being typed
are known and that letters are available more quickly via word
recognition than by reading each letter from the page. It forms
a natural pipeline in the P-E-A-C-I-D-M sequence, in the func-
tional decomposition of Figure 4-16. There are three processors.
P-E-A-C is a serial component that obtains successive words. / is
the central cognitive component that moves from spelling to letters to
keystroke commands. It too is a serial component, because central
cognition is serial, but it operates independently of P-E. Finally, the
motor system M, with any required prior decoding D, Operates
independently of cognition and, even more so, of perception. This
is a loosely coupled pipeline, with buffers in working memory (the
outputs of P-E-A-C and J, respectively), that permits each pro-
cessor to proceed at its own pace. If the buffers become empty for
too long, the downstream processors run out of work and the
throughput diminishes.

The figure shows how such an arrangement operates. The actual
throughput is given by the critical path (the heavy line). Different
processors become critical during different intervals—first the per-
ceptual processor, then the cognitive Processor, then the motor
processor for just a small time, and then back to the cognitive
processor. In the example of the figure, which corresponds to the
