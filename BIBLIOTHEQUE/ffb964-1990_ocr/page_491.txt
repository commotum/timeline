level of detail of the third trial, which moves from level 1 to level 2.
The paths in most of the individual spaces are shown and the im-
passes are labeled. Some things can be seen more explicitly here,
such as the multiple trips between P, space and P2 space. Also the
specific chunks are noted (the upward-sweeping double arrows).
Actually, the situation turns out to be not quite identical to the prior
trial. The space P3 works fine, so there is no need to develop a new
P, space. This is because the bad learning for both trial 2 and trial 3
remains in P;. So P; remains clean, so to speak, and can be used to
develop the next operator. Also, going from rule 2 to rule 3 does not
require new additions to the encoding, only additional elaborations
to the comparison.

For simplicity, the most direct successful case has been shown. If
by chance some other addition has been made to the encoding (say,
about the color of the pegs), then there would be another loop
through the operator-creation column, G)-C-CU, because no satis-
factory concept could have been built. If, again by adventitious
chance, a discriminating feature for this particular task had been
found, then Soar would have gone with it, and another trial would
have been required to reveal its inadequacy. Thus, what we have
been doing is tracing through the mechanism of successful change,
not tracing through a simulation of what a child does in an actual
series of experimental tnals.

This example lets us note the dynamic range of Soar as a unified
theory of cognition. We have moved up many levels of abstraction
from where we started in Chapter 3, at the bottom rungs of the
cognitive band. Productions are at the basic symbol and memory-
access level, the decision cycle is a level above that, and elemen-
tary operators a level above that. We applied Soar to this latter
level, which was that of immediate response (Chapter 5). In the
present analysis we have moved up not just to the level of the
problem space, where we examine sequences of operator applica-
tions, but up to where we collapse all the operators in a space
together and treat all of it simply as the activity in a space. In fact,
we have begun to rise to yet one more level of abstraction, to where
patterns of problem-space evocations are significant—the X-N-
NN-X'-X pattern of failing in a space (X), creating and establishing
a new version of that space (X'), for which the original (X) serves as
a backup. This pattern occurred three times in Figure 8-7, twice for
