all or most available occasions would be warranted.
The ultimate effect of such a Strategy is to convert composed
Operators into simple ones, Whenever simple operators are applica-
ble—that.is, whenever they are retrieved as relevant to a situa-
tion—then the system is Operating essentially in the ~~ sec range
rather than the ~~ 10 sec range. Actual behavior sweuld-be a mix-
ce ture of fast and slow operators, and so the net effect, as the system

shift from ~~10 to ~~1 sec, but ofcourse longer operations come
down accordingly.
The plausibility of this argument comes from the observation that
humans !earn continuously from almost everything they do. Figure
1-2 gave one example of human improvement with practice. Figure
3-12 shows another. The task is Treading inverted text (Kolers,
1975). The paragraph in the figure is the introductory paragraph of
the first chapter. It would take about 100 sec to read. If this whole
book was written in inverted text, and if you could be motivated to
read it all, then by the end of the final chapter you would be reading
at about 20 sec for a short paragraph like this. This would still be
