skilled, though presumably it does not attain the degree of automa-
tion of the way that humans naturally process language.

Actually, it is not evident whether any real degrees of freedom
exist for Soar language, whether one could adopt as the central
mechanism in linguistic processing some other scheme, such as
Lexical-Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 1982). There are many con-
straints from Soar that must be satisfied, other than just those of
syntax. The comprehension-operator scheme must comprehend
language, not just parse it. It must extend to the use of language, to
discourse (for example, speech acts), and to language learning. Fur-
thermore, it must be computationally realized by means of problem
spaces, operators, and impasses. Most important of all, it must
operate in close to real time, which forces linguistic processing to fit
the architecture like a glove.

It is worth discussing one alternative to the operator-
comprehension scheme, namely, modularity (Fodor, 1983). Modu-
larity is an architectural assumption that language comprehension
occurs in its own processing system that is separate from the pro-
cessing system for general cognition. In particular, analysis of
phonological, lexical, and syntactic aspects of the incoming utter-
ance occurs without the dynamic participation of knowledge of
semantics, discourse context, or task context. Modularity does not
specify the actual language-analysis scheme, especially within the
family of familiar grammars. It does exclude a large class of
schemes, namely, those that integrate semantics and other more
general sources of knowledge. Modularity is receiving substantial
attention currently (Garfield, 1989), not only for language but for
other specialized mental functions, such as perception.”

The Soar comprehension-operator scheme is certainly nonmodu-
lar as it stands, if we look at its structure vis-a-vis central cognition.
ft is the natural way to handle language in Soar precisely because it
makes use of the processing facilities that are there. On the other
hand, the Soar architectural structure would admit additional pro-
cessing modules. In engineering terms, the total cognitive system
(Figure 4-15) is a bus-oriented system, and additional modules be-
sides P, M, and C (general cognition) could be hung on the bus.

9. Fodor (1983) casts the issue of modularity quite generally. For our purposes, we
narrow the discussion to language, which was also a central concem of Fodor's.
