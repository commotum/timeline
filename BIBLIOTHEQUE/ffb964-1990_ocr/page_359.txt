rate at which chunking occurs decreases with how much there is to
learn. If there’s not much to learn, there’s not much variability in
the situation and the learning curve is fairly steep. One can see from
the Soar graph that it is sitting almost at the asymptote (observe
how many points are exactly at two decision cycles). If there's lots
of detail in the situation, then the curve is fairly shallow. At the
moment it is unclear where all the variability of detail comes from in
the human's learning experience. This simulation is not yet embed-
