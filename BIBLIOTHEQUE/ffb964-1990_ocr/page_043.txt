30 s Unified Theories of Cognition

of how the user would interact with the computer when operating at
a terminal. From our point of view in the book, the focus was ona
fairly narrow range of tasks, such as text editing and using com-
mand languages. We were concerned with being able to make zero-
parameter predictions, that is, a priori predictions, where no pa-
rameters at all are to be set from the data on the situation to be
predicted. The need for this emphasis, which does not arise in the
experimental laboratory, follows directly from the context of de-
sign, where the situations being designed do not yet exist, so that
perforce parameters cannot be estimated from observing them.
Figure 1-9, from our book, shows the memories and processors
of the MHP. There is a long-term memory, a working memory, and
sensory buffers for vision and audition. There are independently

: operating processors for perception, cognition, and motor behav-

ior. There is only one cognitive processor, but there are distinct
processors for distinct perceptual modes and distinct muscle sys-
tems. Associated with each memory is a type of code, a capacity,
and a decay rate. Associated with each processor is a cycle time,
which is the time for it to do a single primitive operation.

Figure 1-9 is a version of the famitiar information-processing
block diagram, whose roots go back to Broadbent (1958) and which
has become standard in cognition-oriented textbooks (Haber &
Hershenson, 1973, Lachman, Lachman, & Butterfield, 1979). Its
form accords modestly well with the current fashion—the short-
term memories are parts of long-term memory, not separate
memories requiring transfers; and the system exhibits strong but
limited parallel-processing capabilities.

In addition to the block diagram, there is a series of principles of
operation for the system. These are listed briefly in Figure 1-10. The
principles are all familiar and robust generalizations from the cur-
rent understanding of cognition. Indeed, the three examples of sim-
ple theories earlier in the chapter show up here—Fitts’ law, the
power law of practice, and problem spaces. The basic view of con-
trol in the human—the recognize-act cycle—is simply a generalized
form of production systems and thus is consonant with Act*. This
same recognition characteristic implies that memory retrieval must
work from the clues that are available in working memory, which is
the central notion behind the encoding specificity principle (Tulv-
ing, 1983). That behavior always slows down as the task situation
