prior states. The single-state principle has Soar keep only the cur-
rent state, and so the system can go back only to the current state in
a higher space or to the initial state (which can be reconstructed).
Many indications converge on the adoption of this principle. Soar
almost never actually backs up in the same space. It usually does its
search by dropping down into selection subspaces, as illustrated
for the blocks world in Figure 4-14. Even in more sophisticated
searches, such as progressive deepening, as illustrated for algo-
rithm design (Figure 4-20), it comes back to the initial state and
begins over again. The current scheme is computationally ineffi-
cient, requiring each new state to be copied, because the older state
is still viable. Most important psychologically, the current scheme
is unrealistic in terms of short-term memory. Whether difficulties
arise from the amount of material to be remembered or from inter-
ference from highly similar states, maintaining multiple states is
unlikely. Thus, an initial version of the single-state principle will be
installed in Soar$,° and we will treat Soar as obeying the principle.
This change would seem to have little impact on immediate behav-
ior, since searches of multiple states in problem spaces do not
occur. On the contrary, it is actually essential to deal with perceiv-
ing sequential input without inappropriate state copying.

The principle of limited instantiation is that each production pro-
duces only one instantiation per elaboration cycle. Currently Soar4
adopts a simple parallelization of the Ops5 match. Soar finds and
executes all the possible instantiations of all productions, whether
1, 10, or £0,000, all in one cycle of the production system. By our
mapping of Soar to human cognition, this must happen in ~~10 ms.
Two distinct assumptions are required for this. First, productions
are processes that operate fully in parallel. [t seems reasonable to
assume this; they can be independent mechanisms in separate lo-
cales. Second, all the instantiations of the same production can be
produced in parallel. Since a single production implies a common
structure, it is much less plausible to accept this assumption. It
seems more appropriate to take the common structure as imposing

3. This feature is called destructive state modification, because the current state is
modified to create the new one

4. Recently the OpsS match has been shown to give rise to expensive chunks that
produce combinatorially many instantiations, providing additional grounds for modifying
the match (Tambe & Newell, 1988; Tambe & Rosenbloom, 1989}.
