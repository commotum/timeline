of the state that is already in its desired position. This latter is a
simple form of means-ends behavior. This body of knowledge is alt
encoded in productions—it is the initial contents of Soar's long-
term memory.’

Soar proposes all three acceptable operators in the problem
space: move A to the table (A ~> T), move A on top of C (A> Cc),
and move C on top of A (C ~» A). This leads to a tie impasse,
because Soar has no knowledge of which of these moves is worth-
while for the goal. The architecture sets up the tie impasse’s sub-
goal, and the next decision cycle chooses the selection problem
space.

7. Except for the task-specific knowledge of the blocks world, this knowledge is
usually taken as given in any task: it is part of Soar's default knowledge.
