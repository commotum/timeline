wrong character, namely, it seems to be a vehicle for tuning behav-
ior rather than for substantially reorganizing intellectual operations.

In either case there is a problem—which is why choosing be-
tween them is a dilemma. I have asked some of my developmental
friends where the issue stands on transitional mechanisms. Mostly,
they say that developmental psychologists don't have good an-
swers. Moreover, they haven't had the answer for so long now that
they don’t very often ask the question anymore—not daily, in
terms of their research.

8.2.1. The Balance-Beam Task

Figure 8-5 examines the issue more concretely by considering a
specific task, called the balance-beam task. It has its beginnings, as
do ail these tasks, in the work of Piaget and his colleagues, in this
case Inhelder and Piaget (1958). The particular experiment was
done by Bob Siegler a decade ago (Siegler, 1976), but there have
been many other experiments using this task, both before and
since. The child sits in front of a balance beam, which has four pegs
on each side and some disk-like weights on the pegs, as shown. The
beam is held in place by a support under each end (not shown). The
child is asked whether, when the supports are removed, the balance
beam will tilt down to the left, balance, or tilt down to the right.
Even fairly young children do not have any trouble understanding
what the task is and carrying it through.

A child does this task differently at different ages. The correct
tule derived from elementary physics is to compute the total
torque"? on each arm, compare them, and predict accordingly. Sieg-
ter found that children's behavior could be described very cleanly
by simple rules. There are four rules, which gradually increase in
complexity and in adequacy for the task. In all cases, the children
obtain some quantity from the figure that applies to each arm and
permits comparison; then they behave accordingly—equals means
balance and unequals means the greater goes down. This is already
a lot of cognitive organization. The rules differ on the quantities and
when a quantity is relevant. The simplest rule is to respond to

12. The total torque is the sum of the torques of each part of the beam, where the
torque of each part is the weight times the distance to the fulcrum. The parts include the
disks, pegs, and the beam itself. The pegs and beam can be ignored since they are
symmetrically placed, leaving onty the contribution of the disks to be calculated.
