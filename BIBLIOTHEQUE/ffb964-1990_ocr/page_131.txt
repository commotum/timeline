418 ® Unified Theories of Cognition

to underlie the entire hierarchical structure of matter, from nu-
cleons, to atoms, to molecules, and on up. So the hypothesis about
levels may have nothing to do with intelligent systems per se, but
with the way all systems are put together in our universe. All we
need for the argument is that intelligent systems will be hierarchi-
cal. We are perfectly satisfied if the universe in general is hierar-
chical because of evolution—because that is what survives.

Levels are clearly abstractions, being alternative ways of de-
scribing the same system, each level ignoring some of what is
specified at the level beneath it. It all seems to be in the head of the
observer, but there is more to it than that. Levels can be stronger or
weaker, depending on how well the behavior of the system, as
described at a level, can be predicted or explained by the structure
of the system described at the same level. In standard treatments of
systems analysis, systems are called state determined when their
future behavior is determined by their current state. That is what
holds for a strong level. A level is weak if considerations from lower
levels enter into determining the future course of behavior.

In engineered systems (Figure 2-3 again), great care is taken to
construct strong levels—to seal off each level from the one below.
When dealing with logic circuits one need not understand the con-
tinuous circuitry underlying them—except when things go wrong.
When dealing with programs one need not understand the register-
transfer circuits that realize the operations and the interpreter—
again, except when things go wrong. And so on. These are all very
strong system levels, as evidenced by how small the failure rates
are in commercially successful systems.” The strength of a system
level is a property of nature, and not just something in the head of
the observer. It is why, as noted in Chapter 2, being able to describe
a system at a given level carries an empirical claim.

Many natural system levels are also very strong, such as the
atomic and molecular levels. The stronger a level is, the more it
forms a distinct world, in which nothing must be known about
lower levels for it to operate. System levels need not be strong,
however, and certainly it is an empirical matter how strong natural
system levels are. In particular, though it may be assumed that
intelligent systems are organized in levels, it cannot be assumed
that these are all strong levels. There could be lots of ways in which

2, Indeed, the concept of error becomes useful just when a system level becomes
strong enough so that it can be trusted most of the time.
