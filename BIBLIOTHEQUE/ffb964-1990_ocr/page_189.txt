operator has been selected, but not enough is immediately known
to produce a new state as a result (immediately known means that
the required productions do not fire within the elaboration phase).
Hence, even though many things may have happened (new objects
created and old objects augmented with new attribute-values), no
production puts forth a preference for selecting a next state to be
the result of the operator. Furthermore, no productions propose
that the situation should be abandoned. by proposing a different
operator, for example, or a new choice in a higher context. The
upshot is a no-change impasse.

Third, there can be a reject impasse. The only preference may be
one for rejecting one of the decisions already made. For example, in
Figure 4-6 there might also have been a preference to reject s2 in the
supergoal state. Rejection, of itself, doesn’t say what to do to gain
any additional knowledge, so an impasse occurs.

Fourth, and last, there can be a conflict impasse. One production
can provide a preference that operator a1 is better than operator 02,
and another production can provide a preference that operator 02 is
better than operator o1. And when the smoke clears that is all that is
left. Since no constraint exists on what preferences are generated,
such an eventuality can certainly happen (although in our experi-
ence it does so only rarely). Given the semantics of preferences,
there is no way to proceed, hence an impasse occurs.

These, and only these, four different generic situations create
impasses. Analysis of all possible situations, starting from an arbi-
trary collection of preferences, shows that these are the only situa-
tions that can occur that lead to an impasse. In the rest, a single
choice emerges as the one to be made. Of course, the impasse itself
is hardly completely characterized by being one of these four types.
The impasse is caused by the entire state of working memory in
conjunction with the entire recognition memory. No description of
this situation exists other than the total state of the system. Thus,
the impasses signify the full variety of deficiencies of knowledge of
which the system is capable.

An impasse does not mean that Soar is stymied and therefore
halts. Soar responds to an impasse by creating a subgoal to resolve
it. What resolves an impasse is knowledge that would lead Soar not
to make that impasse at that decision point. There are many ways in
which this might happen. What these are or could be depends not
only on the current working memory, but also on all of the knowl-
