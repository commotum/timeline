from experiment 2 of Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977).

has memorized a set of characters, say P, K, G (the memory set),
and is viewing a display, say the four characters /, P, 3, 7, arranged
at the corners of a square (the display). The task is to determine
whether any character of the memory set occurs in the display; in
this case the answer is yes, P does. The display is shown only
briefly, before being masked out. The person is supposed to re-
spond by hitting a yes-button or a no-button as quickly as possible.

The total load on the person varies with the sizes of the memory
set (1, 2, or 4 characters) and the display (1, 2, or 4 characters), thus
producing nine different loads from (1,1) to (4,4). The reaction
times range between 400 and 1,300 ms. These times include the time
for perception and motor response, The ~~100 ms times we are
concerned with are only the differences between the conditions,
which exclude the time for these other activities. (Some of the
larger differences are still much greater than 100 ms, because they
reflect multiple deliberations.) The graphs give the reaction times
for both positive trials (the solid points), when a memory character
did occur in the display, and negative trials (open points), when no
