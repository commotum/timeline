duces one function, not many. To view it as producing many func-
tions, some inputs must be viewed as providing the specification of
the function to be produced. This is shown in panel C of the figure,
The shift is straightforward. From the machine z = F(x, y) one
forms the computer z = Flix), where y is now a parameter, rather
than a second argument, of the function. For each y, the system
produces a different function from x to z

A simple but clear example is a hand calculator, especially one
using postfix, such as an HP calculator. Two numbers are input, say
3 and then S. The output is not yet determined. Then, with another
button push, an operation is selected—plus, minus, multiply, or
divide—and the output is now produced—8, -2, 15, or 0.6, respec-
tively. The example even makes clear the arbitrary nature of the
encoding, since many different schemes can be used to communi-
cate to the machine the function to be computed—postfix (3 5 +),
prefix (+ 3 5), or infix 3 + 5),

Although this view of a computer is quite general, it is not always
employed. We don’t always take the extra inputs to a machine as
the means of converting it into a computer, even when those inputs
Operate to control the machine and shift the relations among the
remaining inputs and outputs. For example, a television set has a
brightness knob. This is certainly another input, and it changes the
input-output function of the TV, where the input is the video signal
and the output is the display. But we prefer to view this as tuning or
adjusting the TV set, not as making it compute a different function,
Similarly, we prefer to view the input to the TV set that determines
the channel as selecting a channel, rather than determining what
function the TV computes. It is easy to identify some aspects that
tend toward a view other than that of the television being a com-
puter. Continuity is certainly an important aspect of tuning. That
the output exists as part of the input is certainly an important aspect
of selection, The broader the variation of function that can be input,
the more the machine seems like a computer. The matter is one of
linguistic usage, of course, so we should not expect there to be too
simple a characterization.

For our task of composing response functions, computational
systems are exactly what is needed. When given different inputs,
they produce different response functions. Consequently, computa-
tional systems are linked to Tepresentation—given that the repre-
sentations are going to be formed by composing transformations to
