Immediate Behavior # 301

Interestingly, the major barrier to a more complete explanation is
the poorly defined motor system in Soar. The major failure in the
original METT analysis concerns the five regularities about errors
{items 18-22). All these error regularities appear to involve primar-
ily the motor system. Four of them (19-22) arise directly from the
motor system. As a physical dynamic system, the fingers, hands,
and arms must be subject to analog errors in space and time, in-
dependent of the details of their control system. Thus, spatial-
accuracy errors would be expected—substitution errors to adjacent
keys (item 19). Likewise, temporal-accuracy errors would be
greater the more independent the physical linkages—transposition
errors occurring more frequently for opposite-hand than same-hand
keystrokes (item 22). Similarly, though perhaps not quite so obvi-
ous, intrusion errors would arise from a finger striking two keys
(hence short interkey intervals, item 20) and omission errors would
arise from a finger failing to strike a key (hence long interkey inter-
vals, item 21). In alt these cases, the likely source of the errors is
not in perception or cognition (the controller) but in the motor
system. For Soar to predict these errors requires an elaboration of
the motor system and the way it is controlled.

The motor system even influences item 18, detecting typing er-
tors without visual feedback. Here Soar does have something to
say. Error detection requires the ability to compare what should
have happened with what actually happened. The process of Figure
5-17 cannot detect errors in perception or in cognition, at least of
most kinds, because the requisite knowledge isn’t available. On the
other hand, the keystroke command issued by the /-operator can be
compared with the keystroke that actually occurred, either through
proprioception, which permits cognition to do the comparison, or
through the motor system. Thus motor-system errors could be
picked up internally. To move beyond this basic qualitative predic-
tion brings us back to the motor system and our current limitations.

5.10, Summary

We have been exploring Soar as a theory of immediate behavior, at
the level of about one second, for at this level the architecture is
reveated. Besides being an interesting testing ground for Soar, im-
mediate-response data are needed to identify the architecture. For-
tunately, there is an immense amount of elegant data at this level—
