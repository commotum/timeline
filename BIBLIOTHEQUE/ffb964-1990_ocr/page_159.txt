the time scales we have inferred. And-we-find-thet When a human
works in a real problem space with composed operators the times

are ~~10 sec.
That full cognition exceeds by one system level the ~~1 sec limit

set for the emergence of cognition presents something of an anom-
aly. It does not show that cognition cannot be attained within the
~~I sec limit. Rather, it shows that cognitive behavior does not
arrive all at once, full blown. It is first limited in being primarily a
selection from prepared possibilities. But if full problem solving is
required then it takes longer.

One might take an evolutionary view on this and reason that
since response time is a factor in adaptation—especially in a world
of carnivores—then the race will go to the swiftest. Given a popula-
tion of organisms who behave at the ~~ 10 sec level, if there is any
evolutionary path for some of them to become faster, then that path
will be found, and the response times will be driven down to ~~1
sec (or even lower, if it were possible), Of course, this is a typical
weak evolutionary argument—explaining what is, without ex-
plaining-etttrer the mechanisms whesebyit-is-achieved or the evolu-
tionary path by which it occurred. Even with the highly schematic
situation we are using, however, the possibility of a mechanism can
be seen.

The response time is driven down by an increase in preparation.
Recall Figure 2-19, which showed the trade-off between delibera-
tion and preparation with equal-performance iscbars. Suppose re-
sponse times reflected mostly deliberation. Then shifting along an
isobar toward increased preparation leads to decreases in delibera-
tion, and might even bring response times down from ~ ~10 sec to
~~I sec. This requires that the system be able to package relevant
knowledge in retrievable form. The mechanisms that would imple-
ment such a strategy cannot be clear. Our argument is too general
for that. But it seems to be a plausible scheme.

Such a scheme requires that relevant knowledge be acquired and
this must happen on specific occasions. The obvious source of such
knowledge is the experience of the organism. In fact, on an evolu-
tionary time scale, experience is the only source available. All other
alternatives, such as reading, being instructed, watching video, and
even conversing, require a developed society of intelligent beings.
Experience also has the property of being relevant to future experi-
ence, at least on a statistical basis, so that it provides suitable
