7.2. Syllogisms

Syltlogisms are probably familiar to most readers—for they go all
the way back to Aristotle and they stood at the center of concern in
logic for many centuries. Figure 7-6 gives some examples and
defines the domain of categorical syllogisms, deductions about cat-
egories of things. The left-hand example is to be read All actors are
bowlers, all bowlers are chefs, therefore, necessarily, all actors are
chefs. This is a straightforward example, framed in concrete terms.
In the right-hand one—Some B are not A, all B are C—the prem-
ises are abstract and the conclusion has been omitted, so you can
derive it yourself. What necessarily follows? This one is not so
easy.

Syllogisms are basic inference schemes involving three terms—
A, B, and C—linked in a major premise, (A, B), and a minor prem-
ise, (B, C), Each premise is composed from the quantifier ail or
some, with the logical connective of affirmation or negation of
attribution (also called the sign). No A are B is synonymous with
All A are not B. Thus, there are four possible premise forms (or
moods, to use the terminology of classical logic), which are listed at
the left of Figure 7-6. Their abbreviations—A, I, E, O—date from
