Unified Theories of Cognition = 5

We can solve this simple recursion to find out how many correc-
tions are required:

X, = e"Xq
2"D = S12

Since the system stops as soon as it can, the inequality can be
replaced by equality, and we can solve for #, the number of itera-
tions:

_ log(2D/S)
log(e)

The number of iterations determines the movement time (MT) if we
assume that the system makes corrections as quickly as it can, but
that there is a certain delay, 8, to get around the loop of perceiving
an error and making a correction:

MT = an = — Slog(2D/S)
tog(e)

This is essentially the equation that is plotted in Figure I-1, and it
gives a good fit. The fitted parameters correspond to an accuracy of
about 10 percent and a delay about 200 milliseconds, both of them
reasonable values.

So here we have a theory of a psychological phenomenon. I want
to make three points about it. First, it is just a microtheory. It is a
theory of just this one phenomenon. Second, you can really make
predictions with it. You can calculate about how long it takes to
make actual movements—and movements under field conditions
as well (Card, English, & Burr, 1978). Third, it is an approximate
theory. It is approximate in accuracy. Actually, Figure I-! shows
one of the better fits; there is often a little more scatter. But it is also
approximate in mechanism as well. It’s rather easy to show that the
particular theory can't be completely right. If actual trajectories are
recorded, a correction is sometimes found, but never a series of
converging corrections, one after another, as demanded by the the-
ory. The microscopic structure of the derivation argument can't be
quite right either. The observation of error must wait until the error
