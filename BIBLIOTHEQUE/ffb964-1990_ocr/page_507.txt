(E]. A large number of studies of social behavior have to do with
affective behavior, no doubt because the affective dimension is
almost always significant in retationships between people. It is en-
tirely possible that before one can define a model of a social agent of
any real use in studying social phenomena, substantial progress
must be made in welding affect and emotion into central cognitive
theories. We noted earlier the role (or lack thereof) of emotion in
Soar. We take emotion and affect to be in part like multiple specific
goals. Existence of an affective dimension to an interaction would
seem to imply a separate basis for guiding the interaction in addition
to whatever task orientation might exist. Furthermore, the specific
content may be important, not just that there exist multiple bases.

[S]. Beyond all the mechanisms listed above, social situations
involve specifically social knowledge—norms, values, morals,
myths, conventions, beliefs, and the like. The source of this knowl-
edge is the specific culture with its specific beliefs and practices,
within which the agent has lived and been socialized. The transmis-
sion of this knowledge via experience over a lifetime presupposes
learning within a social context, but the basic learning capabilities
are already assumed in the basic intendedly rational model (NJ. The
specific import of the social ingredient is that the content of social
knowledge is not given, nor derivable from, the basic mechanisms
and task features that are presupposed in the earlier ingredients.
There is an element of fundamental historical contingency in social
situations. The content of the knowledge might vary rather arbi-
trarily between social groups and cultures, but some such body of
mores is required. Again, [S] is an element that adds onto all the
prior elements. An agent has not only social knowledge, but some
knowledge of other agents’ social knowledge, emotional responses,
and (perhaps) multiple goals. The simplest assumption, of course, is
that social knowledge is entirely shared in common, but in fact the
knowledge is distributed in complex and incomplete ways through-
out a social population.

This set of analytic distinctions is aimed at an understanding of

20. That on occasion a given member may have essentially no investment in some of
these goals only serves to define special groups and special group members.
