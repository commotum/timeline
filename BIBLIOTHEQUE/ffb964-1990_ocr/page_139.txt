nervous system (Shepherd, 1979). The brain can be viewed as a
large collection of local circuits. These local circuits are of the
order of a millimeter cubed (~~1 mm). The local circuits are con-
nected by distal cables. Those cables are of the order of centime-
ters in length (the brain volume is ~~1,000 cm’, hence its linear
extent is ~~10 cm),

Each local circuit contains on the order of ~~5 x 10* neurons.®
This might seem like a lot of neurons, but it probably isn't. There
are several factors that force a body of neurons to be multiplexed.
For instance, given how little information a neuron transmits (~~ ]
bits/sec), neurons must be bundled into cables to get reasonable
data rates (say a factor of ten). Also, coding seems often to be done
by large populations of neurons with broad tuning—a form of dis-
tributed representation—so the distinct functional computing ele-
ments could easily drop by a total factor of 100, leaving about 500
elements for a local circuit.

cells account for ~10 percent, with glial cells making up the rest. This would make for
