here. Again, we will find ourselves listening to what the architecture
says.

The real issue for Soar in this situation turns out to be an internal
precondition for learning, rather than the scientifically more salient
issues concerned with forming and acquiring new concepts. How
does Soar recover from structural error? That is, given that Soar
knows how to perform a task or solve a problem, and given that it
transpires at some point that the knowledge Soar has available is
wrong—what does Soar do then? Even to raise this issue is to
reveal that there are two quite different learning situations. One
occurs when a system does not know something and acquires that
knowledge for the first time. The second occurs when it does know
something, but has it wrong and must relearn it correctly. Much of
the research on learning, both with humans and with computers,
concerns only the acquisition of new information. Even when inter-
ference is the focus of concern, as in much verbal learning, there is
no real conflict. The list given yesterday is not the list given today.
It is not like knowing all your life that the first president of the
United States was George Washington and then finding out one day
(say it isn’t true!) that it was Sam Adams instead.

The balance-beam developmental situation is that a child learns
to predict the tilt of the balance beam according (say) to rule 1. It
has behaved this way for a while. Then, one day it finds out that the
tule is wrong (the experimenter arranges the world so that the con-
flicting facts cannot be ignored). The child’s problem is to change
its behavior.

Perhaps these still do not seem like two qualitatively different
learning situations. Let us view it from Soar’s standpoint. Adding
new chunks seems a reasonable way for Soar to acquire new knowl-
edge. In fact, it works just fine, as we have seen repeatedly through-
out the book. Chunking adds productions permanently to Soar’s
long-term memory—it adds permanent structure. Sa now suppose
that a bunch of these productions are wrong. What is Soar to do
about it? This is the internal problem that Soar has. It must be
solved before a Soar theory of development is possible, for devel-
opment is a situation in which the child learns, is wrong and re-
learns, is wrong again and relearns yet again—and so on into old
age or whenever the old-dog, no-new-tricks stage finally takes over,
if indeed it ever does for most of us.

This problem bears some outward resemblance to the data-
chunking difficulty we faced in Chapter 6. It is a real problem, nota
