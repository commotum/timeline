It predicts the bowed serial-position curve, a classical result. If an
ordered list of items is memorized by repeated trial, then the items
at the ends of the list are learned before the items in the middle of
the list. The little curve opposite result | in the figure shows the
curve—number of trials needed to learn the item versus serial posi-
tion of the item in the list. Likewise, Epam predicts the Von
Restorff effect—if one item is colored red and the rest are black,
the red item is learned before the others. The serial-position curve
has a notch in it at the distinguished item. Epam has strategic con-
