commands. In each such field, the elements have characteristic
residence times, dictated by the temporal dynamics of the entities
they deal with. These temporal dynamics are functional, that is,
their time constants are dictated by the semantics of the date ele-
ments, not arbitrarily by the physical structure of the fields. This
follows from the assumption that biological systems are adapted to
their function.

On the short-duration side, that processing time is tied to func-
tion is fairly clear. The region of the brain that processes visual
fixations doesn’t hold information for an hour because the vision
system is built around eye movements of about 200 ms. Hence
there is a replacement of one visual content with another every
200 ms. A similar argument holds for audition, although the dura-
tion of temporal integration would increase the time constant ta
perhaps { sec. Again, the motor-system command region has its
own characteristic times in which it must be replaceable by new
commands, in order to permit appropriately dynamic action.

Given these functional time constants, Figure 6-20 shows how
multiple STM’s arise. It depicts the familiar total cognitive struc-
ture, with the left-hand vertical column being where attention is
focused at time t,; Soar is working on the element labeled X. Sup-
pose, at %, Soar attends to something in the right-hand vertical
column. The element X is now outside the central system and thus
it proceeds to be replaced (hence removed) at some time constant.
If at time f, attention is shifted back to the left-hand column, and if
X is still there, then Soar has obtained a memory for X from fz to 4.
This region of working memory has become an autonomous short-
term memory for as long as elements stay around. It will have
whatever replacement rate is associated with the field of such work-
ing-memory elements.

These memories provide extra short-term memory, in addition to
the one that automatically supports the normal operation of the
system through the goal context stack. These memories are not
created to be short-term memories per se. They are exploited as
short-term memories by the central cognitive component. Their
memorial characteristics derive from their being operand memory
for specific kinds of processing, which therefore work at the time
scale of the subsystems that use them. They are inherent in the
structure of a system with controllable attention (the A operator)
and variable replacement-time constants for separate fields. The ad
