Intendedly Rational Behavior # 385

second individual, by the way, does not lead to another conclusion,
since he is optional (the o) and hence need not necessarily occur in
the model.

What has been concluded by inspection holds only for this partic-
ular model, but this is not necessarily the only model that can be
built to correspond to the premises. Indeed, following the standard
model-theoretic view (Addison, Henkin, & Tarski, 1972), a conclu-
sion is necessarily true only if it is true in all possible models. The
Johnson-Laird theory posits that humans realize the logic of this
view and attempt to generate alternative models that provide tests
of the initial conclusion (namely, Some C are not A). For instance,
Model 2 is also consistent with the premises, where there are three
individuals, with one of them being a C and an A, but there are no
individuals that are just C’s. It turns out that in this model, as well,
there are some C’s that are not A’s, so the conclusion holds. These
two models exhaust the possibilities, which means that the conclu-
sion necessarily follows and can be produced as the final con-
clusion.

A theory of syllogism based on mental models must describe how
the person generates the multiple models and how he or she knows
that a sufficient (covering) set has been generated. it turns out that,
because of the simplicity of syllogisms, only a few models are ever
required, often only a single one.’ Johnson-Laird’s theory of dif-
ficulty is based on the number of models. The initial model that
people will generate can be described by giving explicit encoding
rules for each premise form. It is quite easy to determine the set of
syllogisms for which this single initial model suffices. These are the
easy problems. The theory does not describe the generation of the
additional models when more than one model is required; this de-
pends on many issues of internal representation, the types of psy-
chological operations that the person uses, and how they are de-
ployed. It turns out, however, that the split between single and
multiple models suffices to give the theory a good deal of explana-

tory power.?

8. Though in general an infinite set of models is necessary to confirm the validity of a
general quantified expression.

9. Johnson-Laird (1983) presents a stronger form of the theory that distinguishes
between two-model and three-model syllogisms, but it has become clear in the interven-
ing period that matters are more complicated than he envisioned at that time.
