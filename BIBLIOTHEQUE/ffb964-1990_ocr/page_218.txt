can behave like a knowledge-intensive system. There is an oft-
expressed dichotomy in the expert-systems field, with knowtedge-
extensive systems on one side and knowledge-learn (or general
problem-solving) systems on the other (Chandrasekaran & Mittal,
1983; Hart, 1982), Soar, as it comes from the factory, so to speak, is
in the general problem-solver mold. Thus, it is of interest that it can
also behave like a knowledge-intensive system. Third, the left-hand
column shows that Soar can move smoothly from one type of prob-
lem solver (at the top) to the other (at the bottom), just by adding
productions. Soar is capable of intermixing general problem-solving
and knowledge-intensive behavior, depending on the occasion.
These three points might all have been apparent just from an exami-
nation of Soar’s structure; but their empirical demonstration is
nevertheless welcome. Besides these demonstrations, it is inter-
esting that the number of rules is relatively small, both in total size
(242 for the Rt-Soar equivalent) and in the small increments to take
Soar from the base system to the full system (adding just 10 produc-
tions). The RI system,to which this version of R1-Soar is equivalent
is about 500 rules. 3

In moving down the left-hand column, Soar is actually walking
back up along an isobar in the preparation vs. deliberation space in
Figure 2-19. It starts by taking 1,731 decision cycles with 232 rules’
worth of immediately available knowledge. Then it moves to taking
243 decision cycles with 234 rules’ worth of knowledge. Finally, it
takes only 150 decision cycles with 242 tutes, In all cases the sys-
tem performs exactly the same task, so it is indeed traversing an
isobar. Thus, a diagram tike that in Figure 2-19 is more than just a
conceptual device; it is possible, at least sometimes, actually to
locate and plot systems on it.

Next is the question of learning. When the R1-Soar effort started,
Soar was not capable of chunking, which had not been Part of the
initial design. However, by the time R1-Soar was operational, it had
been discovered that chunking could be realized in Soar (Laird,
Rosenbloom, & Newell, 1984). What, then, will Soar do with this
task if chunking is turned on, starting from the base system (which
took 1,731 decision cycles)? The top row gives the data. What
happens is something of a surprise, especially to Psychologists who
are used to pretest/posttest learning designs. The middle column is
called During learning, because it measures the performance with
