tion itself. Thus the specification of the function becomes a limiting
factor on how many functions a computer can compute.

This result shows the futility of the hope for computers that pro-
vide all possible functions—which would have yielded the simplest
answer to the question of what functions can be computed. There-
fore, to pursue the question, we must characterize specific classes
of functions and ask whether computers can be found that will
provide all functions of such classes. There seems to be no
difficulty at the low end. It is easy to specify, say, the six elemen-
tary trigonometric functions, sine, secant, cosine, cosecant, tan-
gent, and cotangent, and to design a computer to do all of them. But
our interest is at the high end—in computers that provide as large
an array of functions as possible, Here, again, there is a difficulty.
Any way of specifying a class of functions might amount to specify-
ing a computer for that class. Hence there would be no way ever to
specify a set that would not be computable, just by how it was
defined.

The path that computer science has found for dealing with this
specification difficulty is to shift from classes of functions to classes
of machines. Each machine in a class realizes a different particular
function. So we can talk about the class of functions realized by the
class of machines. If the machines are very general in their charac-
ter, they will define a correspondingly general class of functions.
Then one can ask if there is a single machine in this class that can
realize any function realized by any other machine in the class,
Such a machine is called universal for that class—it can, upon
specification, be any machine in the class. It is, of course, neces-
sary to take some of the inputs to such a machine and use them to
provide the specifications.

This scheme has two nice properties. First, the functions under
discussion are, in an important sense, realistic. Each is realized by
at least one particular machine in the class. Second, since the ma-
chines can be specified very generally according to principles for
constructing them, the classes of functions can be very large. For
instance, thinking physically, one might define all the machines that
can be put together by chemical molecules. To work with this no-
tion precisely, so as to be able to talk about all the functions defined
by the chemical machines, we need to adopt some well-defined
notion of a molecule, such as the classical chemical valence model.
We also must adopt some conceptual way of identifying some
