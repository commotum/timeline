496 « Unified Theories of Cognition

what is involved in a model of a social actor, and what a unified
theory of human cognition might bring to such a model. All
ingredients—[N], (MJ, (G], [E}], and [S]—presume the intendedly
rational individual—the cognitive and intendedly rational bands.
What changes in the social band is the task situation, the goals, and
the content of the knowledge. At issue is whether a theory of only
some of these capabilities is required in order to have an effective
model of a social agent. For instance, the complexities of reasoning
in multiagent situations may be sufficiently complicated that just
arriving, so to speak, with a good model of intendedly and approxi-
mate rational agents does not go very far. Similarly, the nature of
social knowledge may be sufficiently distinctive and constraining
that the behavior of agents that embrace such knowledge is radi-
cally different from the behavior of agents without such knowl-
edge—not just that different actions get taken, but that most of the
scientific effort must be directed at understanding the consequences
of such knowledge.

To pursue this analysis, we looked at an old and familiar piece of
social psychology, called social comparison theory (SCT), set forth
more than thirty years ago by Leon Festinger (1954), SCT ad-
dresses what sort of decisions a person makes in a social situation;
in particular, it posits that the person bases his or her decision on a
comparison with analogous decisions made by other persons. It
remains a live theory, which continues to be used in analyzing
many social situations and indeed continues to be developed theo-
retically (Suls & Miller, 1977). The question we wish to address is
what role is played by the different aspects of the social agent we
have teased out. In particular, would having had a unified theory of
cognition available (say, Soar) have helped with the analysis?

A nice thing about Festinger’s style of theorizing is his tendency
to write down an explicit set of axioms. Thus, we can classify the
axioms for SCT with respect to the type of agent being posited—
which axioms refer simply to the agent being a rational decision
maker [N], which to the multiagent nature of the situation {M],
which to having multiple goals [G], which to emotions [E], and
which to having specifically social knowledge [S]. Figure 8-10 lists
the nine axioms, suitably classified. It is not necessary to go
through the axioms in detail, but let’s take a couple, just for illustra-
tion. Axiom I says every agent has a drive to evaluate. That is
certainly a basic tenet of general cognitive behavior in support of
