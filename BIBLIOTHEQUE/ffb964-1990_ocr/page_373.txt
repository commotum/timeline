solution, interesting features burst upon us. Memory for declarative
material appears to be strongly reconstructive and the theory has
many of the earmarks of an existing theory of human verbal learn-
ing, namely Epam.

Our treatment of other aspects of memory and learning was
somewhat cursory. We showed that Soar got back the power law of
practice, which it might have lost in modifying the original chunking
scheme to incorporate it into Soar. This could be taken as some-
thing of a point of honor with the Soar project. With short-term
memory, we focused on what short-term characteristics followed
from functional requirements, and in doing so we managed an inter-
esting hypothesis about how the zoo of short-term memories might
arise.

Despite the cursory treatments, each topic discussed in the chap-
ter adds to our running box score on the scope of Soar as a unified
theory of cognition (see Figure 6-21).

Finally, we have provided several examples of our theme—that
one should trust the architecture. Good architectures and good the-
ories are alike. They contain within them nonobvious solutions to
many problems. The right approach, more often than not, is to
tease out the solution from the existing architecture, rather than
modify the architecture according to some a priori notion. Indeed,
as Soar (or any other unified theory of cognition) attains substantial
coverage, changes in the architecture must be considered with great
care and attention to detail. Changes can have widespread and
unanticipated ramifications for those aspects that the architecture
already deals with successfully.
