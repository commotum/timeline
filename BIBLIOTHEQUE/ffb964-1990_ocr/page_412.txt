attention to things that are similar to the things already assembled.
Thus, there are attention operators in these spaces that operate
associatively to determine what to attend to next.

We implemented the structure described above in a specific Soar
system for syllogistic reasoning. This system makes use of six prob-
lem spaces. Three of them, comprehend, syllogism, and build-
conclusion, form the top-level path between the presented premises
and the response. The knowledge to form them comes from the
definition of the task, plus general skills in reading and writing. The
comprehend space embodies the ability to deal with natural lan-
guage, but the premises are sufficiently restricted in form that we
could replace this general capability with specific encoding oper-
ators geared to the simple single-word character of the premises
used in experiments. These encoding operators construct an initial
(possibly incomplete) situation model in terms of objects with prop-
erties, and the annotation not; they also leave as a by-product a
model of each premise as a proposition (the utterance model), with
parts subject, object and sign (which constitute the predicate), and
quantifier. The other three problem spaces, prop-to-prop, model-
to-prop, and prop-to-model, have the basic operators required to
refine situation models and proposition models, and also to guide
attention. They extract information from a part of the representa-
tion (either the premises or the situation model) and use it to refine
another part of the representation. For the task of syllogisms,
which involves only understanding a static situation, no model-ro-
model space is needed.

Figure 7-10 illustrates the system's behavior on Some archers are
not bowlers, All canoeists are bowlers. (This syllogism is different
from the one in Figure 7-6; though it is not much easier to solve.)
The steps are marked on the figure. (1) It starts in the syllogism
problem space and applies a read-premise operator, implemented in
the comprehend space, to the first and then the second premise.
(2) This results in an initial situation model, plus the two internal
propositions {the utterance models). This encoding only extracts
information about the subject of the premise. (3) Since the overall
task is to produce a conclusion, a build-conclusion operator is ap-
