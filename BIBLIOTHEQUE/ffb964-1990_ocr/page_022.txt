‘ that the speedup occurred and obeyed a simple plausible law.
Rosenbloom and ! (1986) then took the next step, which was to
create an experimental system architecture that actually learned by
chunking, producing a speedup in the Seibel task and reproducing
the power law of practice, again empirically, but not of the exact
mathematical form of the power law. This architecture used pro-
ductions, and chunking consisted of the growth of additional pro-
ductions. Figure 1-3 shows the simulated practice curve for Seibel’s
task,

Again, I want to make three points about this example. First, like
Fitts’ law, it is also a microtheory. Unlike that law, however, it
deals with a phenomenon, practice, that occurs over a long time
span and that occurs in a wide variety of contexts. Second, also like
Fitts’ law, the explanation is cast in terms of mechanisms. Several
mechanisms combine to yield the result we see in behavior. Third,
the content of this theory does not reside just in the general assump-
tions, but also in the details of the architecture. The simulation is
