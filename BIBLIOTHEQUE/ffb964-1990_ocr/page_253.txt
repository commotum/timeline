than reading. People read at 250 wpm and they type at 60 wpm (to
use conventional numbers), a difference of almost a factor of four.
Both these phenomena are fairly obvious to careful observation,
and they might therefore seem uninteresting. On the contrary, they
eliminate whole classes of architectures. The first says that typing
can’t occur just by iterating isolated responses to each letter. The
second says that typing is limited by some other process than that
involved in perceiving and reading text. It does not identify the
other process, but it eliminates the class of architectures with rela-
tively slow perceptual mechanisms.

(3) People vary in their typing skill (wpm) and they also vary in
how much they comprehend what they type. But there is no rela-
tion between the two—the high comprehenders are not the fast
typists (as if typing depended on understanding); but the high com-
prehenders are not the slow typists either (as if comprehending
interfered with typing). (4) Typing speed is independent of word
order. So the sentence, ‘‘For come now is party time the men all
good to to aid the their of,” is typed just as fast as, “Now is the
time for all good men to come to the aid of their party.’’ Thus, not
only sense but syntax seems not to make a difference. On the other
hand (5), if the letters are scrambled, typing slows down apprecia-
bly to about 60 percent. ‘‘Won is hte mtei fro lal dogo mne ot coem
to hte dai fo ehitr ptyar’’ takes a while.

(6) Normal typing has an unrestricted preview of the coming text
(at least to the edge of the page). If the preview is restricted to a
fixed set of characters, then the interkey interval increases. For
example, it goes from 200 ms to 690 ms if only I character can be
seen (from 60 wpm to 17 wpm). (7) Typing successive keystrokes
from alternate hands is faster than typing them with the same hand.
This seems fairly opvious—the finger of one hand may start while a
finger of the other is still hitting the key. This illustrates again that
obvious regularities can be just as useful as novel ones in con-
straining the nature of the architecture. A rigidly programmed
motor system would not show such a variation. (8) Frequent letter
pairs are faster—there is a word-frequency effect, although it turns
out not to be very big.

(9) Typing speed (interkey interval) is independent of word
length. People type short words and long words at exactly the same
rate, On the other hand (10), there is a word initiation effect. The
first keystroke of a word is stower than the others by about 20
