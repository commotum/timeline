make the representation law hold. But computational systems do
not inherently represent. They are devices that can be used to
represent. It is inherent that a computational system provide the
means to build representation systems. Only if the composed trans-
formations obey representation taws does representation occur.
And that depends on what determines what computations are done.
The prime question about a computational system is what func-
tions it can produce. That’s because the interest in viewing a sys-
tem as a computer is precisely an interest in producing, on demand,
different functions. The great move to composable transformations
is necessary precisely because of the limitations of variability of
special analog representations. Thus we are led down a familiar
computer-science path that ends at universal computational sys-
tems—at universal Turing machines (Minsky, 1967). Though it is
familiar, it is important to trace down this path, to describe it from
the viewpoint of our enterprise of understanding representation,
composable response functions, and knowledge systems.
The perfect computational system would be one that could pro-
duce any possible function. There is, however, a minor difficulty.
_ Any physically realized computer is committed to fixed input and
output ports, fixed places with fixed arrangements for embodying
the medium. Panels B and C of Figure 2-8 are conveniently ambig-
uous about this, because they illustrate abstract systems. A com-
puter cannot provide any function, but at best only any function
between its particular inputs and its particular outputs. The ten-
dency in discussing general matters of tepresentation, computation,
and the like is to work abstractly, So one tends to think only of the
correspondence, but not of the particular input and output domains.
This tendency must be firmly resisted, because physical realizabil-
ity is an important constraint. In any event, as the panel D at the
bottom of Figure 2-8 shows, the difficulty is only a small one in
principle. Given some inputs’ and outputs’, arbitrary in form and
location, the input’ can be transformed and transferred to the input
for the computer (at the input port of the computer), which then
produces its output (at the output port of the computer), providing
the required function. This output is then transformed and trans-
ferred into the output’ that was originally specified. These transfor-
mations themselves, of course, provide functions, but they are
fixed functions and hence can be realized by fixed machines. The
job of the input transformation is to bring the real input’ from
