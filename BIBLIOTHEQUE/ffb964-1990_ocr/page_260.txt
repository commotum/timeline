domains that reveal rather clearly the mechanisms involved. Soar
should incorporate these successful microtheories. It should as-
similate and absorb them into the total architecture rather than pose
radical alternatives. It remains to be seen how extensively this can
be done. There are clear indications that theoretical action comes
from having mechanisms of a given general sort and that specific
models instantiate such mechanisms so that concrete analysis and
predictions can be made. Remember the example in Chapter 1 of
many similar random-walk models of the decision processes for
perception and memory retrieval (Figure !-11), That should remind
us that, at a given stage of scientific development, it is often not
possible to extract the essential mechanisms in pure terms. All we
can do is find a collection of equipotent models with a family resem-
blance. Thus, we can expect a number of places where the mecha-
nisms in Soar that account for various regularities are the Soar-
images of the mechanisms in microtheories that account for these
same regularities.

Explanations and predictions should follow naturally from Soar.
A scientist should be able to think in terms of the architecture—it is

. after all a way of coping with nature and one should be able to take
its stance. More often than not, seeking the natural way for Soar to
do a thing should lead to an explanation. I think of this as taking a
Diracian attitude toward the theory and its relation with nature.
P. A. M. Dirac (1902-1984) was an eminent theoretical physicist.
One of his cardinal attitudes when confronted with a problem was
to find the simple and elegant solution; he was sure that nature
would be found to have solved it that way. That ts the way we
should treat Soar. We should take it seriously and go with the
architectural flow.

Soar should not be treated as a programming language. It may be
tempting to think of Soar this way (recall item 9 of Figure 1-6). After
all, Soar can be programmed and there is a manual for it (Laird,
1986}, But being a programmable system is part of its theory of

Cx taittlon All the features of Soar implicitly carry the claim that
they correspond to features of the human cognitive architecture.
These claims may be wrong, either a little wrong or radically
wrong; but they’re relevant. Thus, to get Soar to explain or predict
some human behavior, one does not program in an explanation in
terms of some other theoretical elements, as if Soar were just a way
of simulating this other structure. Much has been made about the
