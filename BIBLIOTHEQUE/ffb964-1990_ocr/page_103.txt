90 « Unified Theories of Cognition

A system is intelligent to the degree that it approximates a
knowledge-level system.

If these other concepts are accepted as we have laid them out, then
this definition is what answers to the requirements of a concept of
intelligence. It is a theory-bound definition, not an independently
motivated concept. Indeed, that is exactly what one wants from a
theory of the mind—that it should determine what intelligence is,
not that intelligence should be independently motivated.

The formulation of intelligence just given is highly condensed. To
understand it, consider three arguments:

1. If a system uses ail of the knowledge that it has, it must be
perfectly intelligent. There is nothing that anything called in-
telligence can do to produce more effective performance. If all
the knowledge that a system has is brought to bear in the
service of its goals, the behavior must correspond to what
perfect intelligence produces.

2. If a system does not have some knowledge, failure to use it
cannot be a failure of intelligence. Intelligence can work only
with the knowledge the system has.

3. Ifa system has some knowledge and fails to use it, then there
is certainly a failure of some internal ability. Something within
the system did not permit it to make use of the knowledge in
the service of one of its own goals, that is, in its own interests.
This failure can be identified with a lack of intelligence.

Thus, intelligence is the ability to bring to bear all the knowledge
that one has in the service of one’s goals. To describe a system at
the knowledge level is to presume that it will use the knowledge it
has to reach its goal. Pure knowledge-level creatures cannot be
graded by intelligence—they do what they know and they can do no
more, that is, no better. But real creatures have difficulties bringing
all their knowledge to bear, and intelligence describes how well
they can do that.

19, would argue that much of the contention over intelligence has arisen because of
its development in psychometrics without connection to the general theory of cognition.
This might have been the only way it could have developed during the first part of the
twentieth century, given the concurrent hegemony of behaviorism, which served to
Tepress cognitive theories. But the consequence remains.
