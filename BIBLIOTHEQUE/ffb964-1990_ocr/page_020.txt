mirror. Just like Fitts’ law, it is extremely robust. It holds not only
for immediate motor-perceptual tasks, like reaction-time tests and
mirror tracing, but also for recalling facts, editing with text editors,
and on through cognitive tasks such as checking proofs or playing
solitaire (Newell & Rosenbloom, 1981). Thus, there is a ubiquitous
quantitative law of practice, which has come to be called the power
law of practice. (Taking logs of both sides of a power law, T =
BN“, yields the linear curve, log(T) = log(B) — alog().) Again,
you would think it would appear in all our elementary psychology
textbooks, but it doesn’t.

A few years ago, Paul Rosenbloom and I developed a general
theory for this power law of practice, based on the notion of chunk-
ing (Newell & Rosenbloom, 1981). Chunking has a long history in
psychology. The term was coined by George Miller in his classical
review of short-term memory limits (Miller, 1956; Bower & Win-
zenz, 1969}. A chunk is a unit of memory organization, formed by
bringing together a set of already formed chunks in memory and
welding them together into a larger unit. Chunking implies the abil-
ity to build up such structures recursively, thus leading to a hierar-
chical organization of memory. Chunking appears to be a ubiqui-
tous feature of human memory. Conceivably, it could form the
basis for an equally ubiquitous law of practice.

This theory of practice is summarized in three general proposi-
