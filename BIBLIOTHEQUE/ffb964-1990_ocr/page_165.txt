doing that. In short, behavior is no longer context free. The magic
in all of this, of course, is the knowledge that the agent brings to the
situation. If the agent knows nothing about the outside world—its
structure, history, mechanics—then it has nothing to work with in
escaping from the local context. It is of the essence of adult human
minds that they bring a vast amount of knowledge into every situa-
tion they are in. The door to the room closes, the shades are pulled,
but all the world is still there inside the human head. Not, of course,
really there, only represented. But no outside observer, trying to
predict the behavior of that human, can ever know all that is in its
mind.

Note that in the cognitive band the system may be goal oriented,
but that is not how it operates. It operates because it follows com-
putational laws. We see the mechanisms of its attempts to be ra-
tional. Thus, the realm of the intendedly rational level is different
from the cognitive realm.

3.11. Higher Bands: Social, Historical, and Evolutionary

What happens above the rational band? Or does this one just go on
up forever? In Figure 3-3, the time scale trails off at the upper
reaches, and for good reason: this book focuses on the structure
and mechanisms of the cognitive band. However, a brief discussions.
will provide an outer context, so to speak. Figure 3-14 enumerates a
- sequence of speculative higher bands. Above the rational band
comes the social band, above that the historical band, and above
that the evolutionary band. Each spans a factor of about a thousand
in time scale.
It is not clear that there actually are any higher bands. There are
