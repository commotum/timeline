Indeed, there need not always be aclear choice. All the untoward
things can happen. They prevent the decision procedure from
choosing a unique decision and hence they prevent Soar from mov-
ing forward. They are impasses. When Soar finds itself in an im-
passe it creates a subgoal to resolve the impasse. Thus, subgoals
arise dynamically because Soar is unable to proceed. Furthermore,
this is the only way subgoals can arise. If Soar knows what to do
next, there is no need of a subgoal.

The possibilities for impasses arise from the different ways in
which the decision procedure can fail. The decision procedure can
be thought of as getting rid of all the decisions that can't possibly be
chosen. First, it attends only to decisions that are acceptable. Then,
it gets rid of all the decisions that are rejected. Of those remaining,
it throws away all that are worse than some other acceptable and
not-rejected decision. Finally, it considers only the decisions con-
cerned with the highest subgoal. Any change in a goal at some
level—a change in problem space, state, or aperator—completely
preempts all changes about subgoals, because these latter were all
created in response to the impasse at this higher level.

Given the finally remaining set of decisions, just four ways exist
for impasses to arise. First, there can be a tie impasse. When all
things that are not to be chosen are cleared away, there can be lefta
collection of alternatives that can’t be discriminated. They are all
acceptable, none have been rejected, none are preferred to any of
the others, and they are not indifferent.*

Second, there can be a no-change impasse. After all is said and
done, there are no choices available. Either they have all been
rejected or nothing was ever declared to be acceptable. This might
seem a rare situation, but it happens all the time. For example, an

4. Indifference is the definite preference that any of the indifferent elements be
selected.
