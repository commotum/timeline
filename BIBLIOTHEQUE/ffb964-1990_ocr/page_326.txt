problem solving (Figure 4-10). Again Soar reaches an impasse be-
cause it doesn’t know which alternative it should evaluate first. The
Tesponse to this impasse is to go into an advise space in which it
seeks knowledge from outside (by executing the ask operator). The
external advisor then indicates a specific operator, namely, to iso-
late the variable by adding to the right-hand side. This tells Soar
which operator it should evaluate—not which operator to use, but
the one to evaluate. Thus, Soar can reject the advice, if its own
evaluation leads it to another conclusion. The figure shows the
evaluation proceeding positively. Soar’s approach to evaluation
now continues as in the blocks-world task, namely, to look ahead to
see the consequences of using the operator. It proceeds to solve the
problem, which requires some more problem solving, indicated
without detail by the wavy line in the figure. This evaluation activ-
ity leads to building chunks. Thus, when Soar attempts to solve this
particular problem again, these chunks incorporate the knowledge
of how to make selections in the original space. In sum, it asks for
advice on what operator to try; then evaluates that advice; and the
evaluation leads to chunks being built that transfer the advice
knowledge to where it is finally used.
