4.5. Designer-Soar: Difficuit Intellectual Tasks

Let’s consider another example of Soar behavior, also in the direc-
tion of substantial intelligence but somewhat different from RI-
Soar. The system is called Designer-Soar (Steier, 1989). Its task is
to design algorithms, This is an intellectual task, taught in advanced
undergraduate courses in computer science (Sedgewick, 1983). A
simple example task would be to design an algorithm to find if an
element is a member of a given set. A somewhat more difficult task
would be to design an algorithm to sort a set of numbers in ascend-
ing order. That is, if the input were the numbers (S, 8, 6, 3, 7, 3, 2)
then the sorting algorithm should produce (2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8). The
task for the problem solver is not to sort these particular numbers,
or even to be able to sort any given sequence of numbers. The task
is to find an algorithm—the essential steps of a program or proce-
dure-—that will sort any sequence of numbers.

Designer-Soar is the work of David Steier, It has its roots in two
earlier non-Soar AI systems to design algorithms. One was De-
signer, developed by Elaine Kant, David Steier, and myself a few
years ago (Kant & Newell, 1983; Steier & Kant, 1985). The other
was Cypress, developed by Doug Smith (Smith, 1985). Versions of
Soar were created for each of the systems (see Steier, 1987, for
Cypress-Soar). The current Designer-Soar (Steier & Newell, 1988;
Steier, 1989) is a successor that amalgamates a number of important
features of both these systems.!?

There are interesting issues about how to formulate the task of
algorithm design. The first issue is, What is desired? An algorithm,
in contrast to an actual computer program, provides only the essen-
tial steps that have to be done. Given an algorithm, a program must
still be written in a specific programming language (Lisp or Pascal);
but the general plan is now available. Thus, whereas the task of
programming has a well-specified desired object (the code), algo-
Tithm design does not. Still, an algorithm must be cast in some
representation. There is no consensus in computer science about
what this must be, largely because the desired result really is the
knowledge on the part of the designer about how to proceed, which
could be represented in many different ways. The issue is analo-
gous to what is desired when a person reads a paragraph to com-

earlier systems; the current Designer-Soar was created in summer 1987
