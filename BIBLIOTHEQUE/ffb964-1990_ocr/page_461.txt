senses, only one of which can be satisfied on a given occasion.
Soar's expectations are structured as disjunctive sets of expecta-
tions, plus an expectation that at least one of the set must be
satisfied. This latter expectation includes an expectation of when
the other expectations will be satisfied—for instance, by the end of
the sentence. It is these expectations about the satisfaction of other
expectations that finally put bounds on the comprehension effort,
so Soar doesn't go on forever, day after day, waiting for some final
bit of information to arrive.

Figure 8-4 shows a high-level trace of Soar doing this elementary
bit of language learning. Operators are in brackets, and the compre-
hension operators are italicized. Soar starts through the sentence.
When it reads check nothing happens, because it doesn't know
anything about check.” Then the comprehension operator for is
fires, putting two expectations in working memory. Angle brackets
indicate expectations. Then the comprehension operator {above}
fires. It expects a post-object, and this expectation is placed in
working memory. Finally comes {star}, which produces a particular
bit of semantics that says there is an object called star. Objects in
the task domain are in parentheses. This permits the {above}
operator to fire a second time, producing the domain object (above
star). This is exactly what happened in the original sentence of Plus
is above star. That ends the sentence; since no more words arrive,
hence no more comprehension operators fire. If, per contra, Soar
had known check, then an object corresponding to it would have
been around and the fis] operator would then have been evoked a
second time.

Soar is now in a situation where some unsatisfied expectations
are lying around (two, actually). At the end of the sentence, the
expectation that there shouldn’t be unsatisfied expectations at the
end of a sentence causes the (handle-incomprehension] operator to
fire. This operator is not a comprehension operator, but one that
recognizes unfulfilled expectations that demand to be satisfied.
Soar descends into an implementation subspace. There, the first
operator to fire generates interpretations. It examines the situation

7. Soar could have an expectation that it will know every word it receives. Most
adults do, although children don’t. An expectation of this sort would provide another
path for evoking language learning, which would help for completely unknown words, as
here, but not for words with missing word senses or for known words used inappropri-
ately. In general, multiple paths for detecting error will exist.
