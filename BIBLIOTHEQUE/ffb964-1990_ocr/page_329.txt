(1) All learning arises from goal-oriented activity. One learns by
doing, as Dewey (1910) said. This is arguably the most important
single feature of chunking. In order to learn, the organism has to be
goal oriented. It does not have the goal of learning, of course—
learning is not deliberate. Rather, it learns about only what it is
goal-oriented about. Furthermore, it does not learn directly about
what it deliberately wants. Rather, it acquires the knowledge it
needs to obtain what it deliberately wants. Thus, to do learning of
some specific type, the learner must get itself into a situation which
is goal oriented in the right way. Many consequences follow from
this requirement.

(2) Learning occurs at an approximately constant rate—the rate
at which impasses occur in the system, In Chapter 3, in setting up
the order-of-magnitude time scales, I estimated the rate at a chunk
every couple of seconds. Let us now refine this. We assume that
humans chunk bottom-level impasses, that is, impasses whose res-
olution is not interrupted by further impasses. In Soar we call this
bottom-up chunking to distinguish it from all-goals chunking. Fig-
ure 4-21 showed both types of chunking on the same algorithm-
design task. Suppose a bottom-level impasse resolution takes on
average M simple operators to resolve. Each simple operator in
Soar takes just two decision cycles, one to select it and one to
implement it. It cannot take more than that without an impasse
occurring, either a tie impasse in selecting the operator, a no-
change impasse in implementing the operator (if it required a sub-
