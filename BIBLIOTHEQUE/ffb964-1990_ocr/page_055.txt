Foundations of
Cognitive Science

—_——$—$—$$—— 2 |_—________

We start with the foundational issues of how to describe the basic
Structure of cognitive systems. We need some common ground as
we go forward, so that we don’t become distracted, say, about the
nature of knowledge or representation. We will be covering familiar
territory, for much attention has been paid to these notions. Some
of them have a classical philosophical literature, and all of them
have attracted continuing consideration in cognitive science in the
last decade, especially as philosophers have finally come to take an
interest in the subject. Still, it is worthwhile reworking the famil-
iar, It must be recognized, though, that there is never much agree-
ment on foundations—they are always less secure intellectually
than what they support.

Despite the disclaimer, I do have something I am attempting to
achieve while reviewing these notions. I want to tie them closer to
the physical world than is usually the case. Rather than emphasize
the abstract character of the various types of systems we will deal
with, I will emphasize how they are grounded in humans as physical
systems in a dynamic world. Theories of human cognition are ulti-
mately theories of physical, biological systems. Our ability to de-
scribe human cognition in one way rather than another rests ulti-
mately on the physical and biological nature of human beings.
Furthermore, their grounding in the world implies additional con-
straints that can shape our theories.

For convenience’ sake we will take up, in turn, the major terms
that will come up again and again, starting with the notion of a
behaving system, which is just a necessary preliminary. After that
we will cover knowledge, representation, computational systems,
