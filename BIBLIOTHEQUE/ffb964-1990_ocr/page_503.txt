head. This feature of social systems says nothing about whether the
social group can make better decisions or arrive at better solutions
than the individual. Manifestly it can, if the combined knowledge of
the group contains specific facts that are in total possessed by no
single individual. So what kind of model is appropriate for the so-
cial-system level? Modeling groups as if they had a group mind is
too far from the truth to be a useful scientific approximation very
often. It is, of course, much used in human discourse; we refer to
even the largest social institutions (governments and corporations)
as individuals and legitimize such use by legal fictions. People si-
multaneously retain awareness of the social character of such in-
stitutions, however, and do not treat them simply as individuals.

How can a unified theory of cognition contribute to the social-
band—to social psychology and sociology? The obvious answer is
that individual psychology contributes a model of the social person,
which can then be used as a component within social psychology.
This answer seems essentially correct, although it leaves undeter-
mined how big a role a model of the individual social person plays
or could play in social science. Even if the role were tiny, it is still
probably the key to what a unified theory of cognition has to offer.
A look around at the current scene in the social sciences reveals a
great dea! of emphasis on the individual, though taken in a social
context. Studies of attribution, social perception, affiliation, and
attachment—all these are primarily focused on the individual
within the social context, not on the interacting groups, organiza-
tions, or institutions that make up the social band proper. Thus, the
model of the social human to be used in social science is of more
than minor import, and it should be a prime contribution of cogni-
tive science.

Indeed, social cognition is exactly the area within social psychol-
ogy that has attempted to take the stance of modern cognitive psy-
chology and move it into the study of the social band. The roots of
the social cognition movement go back fifteen years (Carroll &
Payne, 1976),® and the area is by now fairly mature. My own as-

of which the work of Soloman Asch (1956) can be taken as the emblem. But the roots of
this earlier movement are in Gestalt psychology, and it was a distinct and notable event
when sociat psychology moved, in the early 1970s, to pick up on the then-maturing
information-processing psychology. A perusal of the edited symposium just referenced
makes this clear.
