P Perceive: sense the environment
Duration: uncontrolled, decreases with intensity

E Encode: perceptual parse {production sequence)
Duration: Increases with complexity, not required for detection

A Attend: focus on input (operator)
Duration: Delay + search, decreases with preparation {to null)

C Comprehend: analyze for significance {operator}
Duration: Increases with complexity, decreases with preparation
(must exist)

T Task: set what task is to be done (operator)

Duration: decreases with preparation (to null)

intend: determine and release action (operator)

Duration: decreases with preparation (must exist)

O Decode: convert commands (production sequences}
Duration: increases with complexity, decreases with preparation (to
null)

M Move: make the commanded movement
Duration: uncontrolled, decreases with force, imprecision, prepara-

will take each function to be accomplished by a distinct operation.
Figure 5-5 gives the minimal complete functional path from
stimulus to response. It goes from perception (P) to encoding (£} to
attending (A) to comprehending (C) to tasking (T) to intending (/) to
decoding (D) to motor action (M). These are not stages in the sense
made familiar by Sternberg (1969), but they can become stages as
soon as data dependencies show up, where the output of some
productions becomes the input of others.

A functional analysis always raises questions about uniqueness.
Some freedom or indeterminism always exists, and understanding it
is critical to using a functional scheme. We will discuss the general
issues below. One type of variation, however, is an important part
