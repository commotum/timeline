Basic Phenomena
. Faster than reaction time

. Slower than reading

. Skil¥camprehension independance

, Word-order independence

. Slower with random letter order

. Slower with restricted preview

. Faster alternate-hand keystrokes

. Faster frequent letter-pairs
9. Word-length independence of interkey intervals
10. Word-initiation effect
me 11. Specific letter context counts

12. Dual task independence

Units of Typing
13. Capy span size 13.2 characters
14, Stopping span size 1-2 keystrokes
15. Eye-hand span size 3-8 kaystroke
18. Eye-hand span less as m=-
17. Replacement ane 10! BS
Ero POST: ONLY
18. Process dey SEY"
19, Substitution +s mostly adjacant key
20. Intrusion errors mostly short interkay interval

21. Omission errors mostly jong interkey interval
22. Transposition errars mostly cross hand
Skill Effects

23. 2-finger digrams improve faster than 1-finger

24, Tapping faster with typing skiil

25, Decrease of variability with skill

26. Increase of eye-hand span with skill

27, increase of replacement span with skill

28. Méderate increase of copy span with skill
29. Increase of stopping span with skill

(4) The algorithm picks up each word independently of context
and processes it (for spelling and letters). This shows directly that
word order doesn't make any difference.

(5) This same algorithmic structure demonstrates directly that
letter order does make a difference, and a large one. If the system.
can’t recognize a word, it can't get its spelling and hence its letters.
It must then process each letter one at a time, which implies much
