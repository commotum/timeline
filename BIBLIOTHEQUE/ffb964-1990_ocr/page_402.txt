tion permits the expression of arbitrary bodies of knowledge, and
the problems that arise in processing such knowledge must there-
fore be as hard as problems can get.

Model representations are limited in scope, but easy to process.
Simplicity is obtained because models adhere to a structure-
correspondence principle. The model representation (that is, the
internal data structure) has parts and relations; each of these corre-
sponds to a part and relation in what the model represents in the
external world. Thus each individual part and relation of the inter-
nal model represents something. No completeness or exhaustive-
ness is implied. The external world can have many other parts,
relations, and whatnots—the world is always indefinitely rich rela-
tive to any model. It might be thought that this is the way all
representations work, but a glance at the predicate calculus expres-
sions in Figure 7-9 will show this not to be the case. In P2, for
example, nothing in the external world corresponds to the parts of
the expression (the data structure that is the representation),
namely, nothing corresponds to (y), B(y), D, or the rest. One might
think B(y) should correspond to something, but it occurs on the
antecedent side of the implication—if By) holds, then Cy) does
also, but nothing of which B/y) holds need be there. What P2 does
is express a truth about the external world; that is where much of its
representational power comes from. Not every aspect of a model
(the data structure) represents, of course. A model is a physical
object and thus contains an indefinite set of aspects and characteris-
tics of its own. Thus, the principle takes as given some characteri-
zation of the model as a data structure, with its own distinguished
parts and relations; and it is for these that each must have its corre-
spondent in the referent.

The important consequence of this principle is that match-like
and counting processes suffice for working with the model. Match-
ing and counting are fundamentally inexpensive processes. To test
whether two representations represent the same object requires
only that their parts be put into correspondence and tested for
identity, which itself is a match process. If an incompleteness oc-
curs in matching, it is immediately apparent. If a failure occurs in
matching, it is known that no further processing will reverse the
result. To construct an object to the specifications of the represen-
tation is possible if the model is used as a template—again, a match-
