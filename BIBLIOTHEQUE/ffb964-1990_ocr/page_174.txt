learning mechanism.

4.1.1. Problem Spaces for Formulating Tasks
Soar formulates all its tasks as problem spaces. Every system must
somehow represent to itself the tasks it is to work on. The represen-
tation provides the framework within which knowledge is brought
to bear and in which task accomplishment is assessed. Thus, for
Soar, all cognitive action occurs within a search space.

Figure 4-2 gives a picture of a problem space, which should seem
familiar from Figure 2-16 (even to the same blocks-world domain).
The problem space is searched to accomplish the task——to con-
