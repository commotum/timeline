Immediate Behavior # 281

are two syllables in delete, so two operators are required to get the
syllables, one for each. Likewise, two operators are required to get
the spelling. An operator is required to obtain the letter from the
syllable, which yields 6 operators for the letters. Obtaining each
letter provides the decomposition to obtain the letter in the next
place. Consequently, each letter must be identified as being a con-
sonant or a vowel (6 more operators). Then the discrimination must
be made. This is handled by an operator to pick out the consonants
and ignore the vowels. Here, there are only three operators, one for
each consonant and none for the vowels. In this particular al-
gorithm, the whole abbreviation is obtained before it is typed out.
Three commands need to be issued, one for each letter, so that
requires 3 more operators. Adding up all the times corresponding to
these operators gives ~1,320 ms. John’s algorithm has almost the
same operators (25 instead of 22) but uses 66 ms per operation
instead of 60 ms, giving John’s algorithm a total of 1,650 ms, slightly
higher than Soar.

The motor operation (D + M) has been lumped into a single
value of ~180 ms per letter. Given our lack of clarity about a model
of autonomous composed dynamic systems, it is hard to separate D
and M, except in the simplest possible cases, as we did earlier. The
choice of ~180 ms will be justified to some extent later. At the
moment, it at least permits us to get final aggregate times. John’s
(experimentally estimated) motor time was 203 ms per keystroke,
so she gets a slightly higher total again, namely, 609 ms versus ~540
ms. Finally, we end up with Soar making a prediction of how long it
will take a person to react in this situation—to type dit after seeing
delete, Soar’s prediction is ~2,140 ms. John’s prediction is consid-
erably higher, ~2,573 ms. In fact, the observed average time is
2,400 ms, which is in the middle. The errors of prediction are 12
percent over and 7 percent under, respectively.

Figure 5-11 is an analysis of a single task and made one predic-
tion. In fact, theoretical predictions have been made with John's
theory for 27 SRC situations, including many of the original basic
studies on SRC and the one by Duncan described earlier. Figure
5-12 presents all the results, in a plot of predicted (on the horizon-
tal) versus observed (on the vertical) response times. Each point
represents one condition of one study, each of which presented a
specific situation in which an SRC time could be modeled and com-
puted. The average accuracy is 12 percent. As can be seen, the
