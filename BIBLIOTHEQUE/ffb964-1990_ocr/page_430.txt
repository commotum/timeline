418 = Unified Theories of Cognition

wrinkles that appear to solve some of the problems with existing
systems and permit extension in important ways (for example, to
learning). But Soar is not implicitly making a claim about the
novelty of these mechanisms. It is claiming—and this is no mean
claim—that it is realizing these mechanisms within a total cognitive
system in which the language mechanisms can be related to the
mechanisms used for all other cognition and in which all these
mechanisms mutually constrain one another,

Let’s go through the words of the sentence, defining what each
comprehension operator will do. We have indicated only the min-
imal knowledge needed to perform this specific comprehension.
The word plus creates an object, with the name “‘plus.”? The word
is creates an expectation for a pre-object (one determined by words
occurring prior to the word in question) and an expectation for a
post-property (one determined by words occurring after the word in
question). These are expectations for objects in the semantic repre-
sentation, not for words in the coming utterance. If these expecta-
tions are satisfied then the operator will create a predicate—that the
object has the property. The word above creates an expectation for
a post-object. If this expectation is satisfied, then the operator
creates a property of being above the object. Finally, the word star
creates an object with the name ‘‘star,”’ analogously to plus.

We have not included any alternative meanings for these words.
That might be thought just a question of expository or analytic
simplicity. In fact, the laboratory task context of simple sentence
verification is one in which persons do the task repeatedly after
becoming familiarized with the task. Consequently, all linguistic
ambiguities have disappeared, such as plus meaning addition. Of
course, there remains the question of how the person becomes
specialized, so as not to find any ambiguity in the task itself. Soar
should certainly be expected to provide a theory of that as well. But
for this task (and hence for this example) these issues are not in
evidence.

Three problem spaces are required for this task. There is a task
space, where the top-level task will be done. It has operators to
acquire information, to compare representations, to respond by
pushing a button, and to recognize when it is done. Some of these
operators must be implemented in spaces of their own. The com-
prehension space is the space we have been describing that is full of
comprehension operators. It also has a read-word operator to ac-
