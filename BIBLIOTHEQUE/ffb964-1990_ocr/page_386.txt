Li B61. So we'll start back here and make it a 7.
B62. Now ifthe...
B63. Oh, I'm sorry, | said something incorrect here.
B64. I'm making...
L2 865. No, no, | didn’t either.
B66, R is going to be a 7,
B67. then this will be 7,
B68. and that will be 7,
B69. and it’s the Ls that will have to be 3a,
870. because 3 plus 3 is 6
L3 B71. plus 1 is 7,
B72. Now, it doesn't matter anywhere what the Ls ara equalto...
873. so I’m independent of L when | get past the second column
here.
B74. But now | know that G has to be either 1
B75. or 2,
876. depending on whether or not E plus O is greater than 10
B77. or greater than 9. .
878. Now I have this O repeating here in the second cotumn from
the left.
B79. That is, itself plus another number equal to itself.
L4 B80. This might indicate that E was zero...
{5 881. In fact, it might have to necessarily indicate that.
LG 882. I'm not sure.
L? B83. Or, E could be 9
B84, and | would be carrying 1,
L8 B85. which would mean that | was carrying 1 into the left-hand
column,
L9 B86. {£: What are you thinking now?)

point of view of this search-control-level simulation, this result sim-
ply emerges from the execution of an operator (TD) and we need
not inquire about it. The bases in reality for the uncertainty, which
have their effect inside TD, is that L = 7 would also be possible if R
were not 7; there is thus an extra interaction between the two
relations involving 7, with one of them (R — 7) being posited, rather
than derived, so it could be changed. This is apparently enough to
induce unclear. To explore that requires models for the cognitive
behavior in AV, PC, and TD.

Having decided that TD's result is unclear, $3 (that is, our Soar
simulation of $3) comes back (line L2) and executes the operator
GET L, This operator leads the system (via a no-change impasse in
