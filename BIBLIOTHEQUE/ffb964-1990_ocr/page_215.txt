Figure 4-17 gives the hierarchy of problem spaces of R1-Soar.
This structure comes from the second, more-complete version (van
de Brug, Rosenbloom, & Newell, 1986). These are the operator-
implementation spaces. Each one gets invoked when an operator in
another (higher) space is selected and cannot complete its task just
by the knowledge directly available (that is, in productions in the
higher space). Then a no-change impasse occurs and the appropri-
ate space to do the processing for the operator is selected. This

U1. A methodology called RIME (Bachant, 1988) has been developed at Digital in
which to produce a revision of RI. RIME adopts some task-structuring features of R1-
Soar, namely. problem spaces and some method schemes, although not impasses or
chunking. On the one hand, REME. provides some verification that the total RI system
could be constructed along the lines of Ri-Soar. On the other, the current RI/KCON
system at Digital has grown in size, functionality, maintainability, and modifiability, so
that the original Rl-Soar now appears as a very madest part of the total system.
