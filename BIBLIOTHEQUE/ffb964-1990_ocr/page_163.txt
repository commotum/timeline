3.10. The Intendedly Rational Band

What happens as duration increases beyond the ~~10 sec level?
What prevents there simply being more and more levels of the
cognitive band? The elementary-deliberate level at the top of the
cognitive band admits operators composed of simple operators. But
operators can become increasingly complex, so that levels simply
grow on top of levels. There must be a level whose operators are
composed of composed operators. Why is there not simply an
infinite tower of cognitive levels into the sky? In some sense this
must be the way the system grows.

But what also happens is that cognition begins to succeed. We
take the system to have goals with respect to its environment and
its cognitive processes to be oriented toward the attainment of
these goals (Figure 3-13 shows this simple structure).'5 The system
will have some knowledge of this environment, but necessarily it
will be limited. As discussed in the previous chapter, as the system
has more time, the solutions it finds will reflect whatever knowledge
it has. As that happens, we will have less and less of a chance of
ascertaining what processing was involved in determining the solu-
tion. Processing will certainly go on, as indicated by the tree of
arrows inside the box, for the solution will be determined by the
knowledge available to the system. Thus, as time increases—which
is to say, as the levels of problem spaces build up—there will be a
shift toward characterizing a system as a knowledge-level system,
that is, just by the goals and knowledge it contains, without regard
to the way in which the internal processing accomplishes the linking
of action to goals (of means to ends). To go back to the initial
language of response functions, what determines the response func-
tions wilt be only the external environment plus the goals of the
organism.

In Figure 3-3 the system that operates at the knowledge level is
shown to be in the rational band, but it is clear from the account
above that it attains this status gradually as the levels ascend (im-
plying more and more time to solve the problems). Thus, the
justifiable name is the intendedly rational band.

15. Whence comes the presumption of mind being goal-oriented? Cognitive science
in general assumes it. Ashby (1952) is one of the only people [ know who has tried to
derive goal behavior from general system postulates.
