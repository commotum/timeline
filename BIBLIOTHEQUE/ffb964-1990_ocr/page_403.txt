like process. Thus, the processing is not only inexpensive, it is
bounded in strong ways.

Something must be paid in return for inexpensive processing. It is
representational scope. Not everything can be represented in a
model, What is difficult to represent, and where modeis show their
limitations, is the various forms of incomplete knowledge about the
environment. In particular, in a model it is hard to represent knowl-
edge involving negation, disjunction (alternatives), optionality,
conditionals, constraints, trade-offs, uncertainty, and so on.

The situation can be made clear by considering disjunctions. Sup-
pose it is known that a man will come to your home to receive an
answer to a question. It is easy to construct a model of that, witha
model of the doorway and of the man. But suppose either the man
or his valet may arrive. Now there are two different situations.
However, since the man and his valet are fairly similar, and only
their presence and their function of being a receiver of information
are relevant, it is still possible to construct a single model with an
abstract person at the door. But suppose either the man may arrive
or he may call on the telephone? Or that he may arrive, but if he
does not arrive before 8 o'clock, then you should go to his house?
At some point, there is no way to combine the alternatives in a
single composite model (without abstracting away from everything
of interest). It seems relatively straightforward to represent in a
model any of the actual situations that might eventuate. What pro-
duces difficulty is variation in the state of knowledge about these
various situations.

When a single model fails (and one is unwilling to retreat to
propositions), there is a general way out—to enumerate a collection
of models, each of which corresponds to one of the alternatives.
Processing now must proceed by iterating over the separate models
and becomes thereby more expensive. If there is just a single di-
mension of variation, the increase in processing is only linear. As
multiple optional and conditional situations arise, however, the in-
crease easily becomes combinatorial. Thus, the key issue in the
viability of enumeration is the processing required.

Propositional and model representations differ in another impor-
tant way. Propositions suffer the frame problem, models do not.
The frame problem (McCarthy & Hayes, 1969; Pylyshyn, 1987)
refers to what background knowledge (the frame of reference) re-
