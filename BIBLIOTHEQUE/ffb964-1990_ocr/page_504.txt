492 « Unified Theories of Cognition

sessment, which I do not wish to defend too strongly, is that its
promise has not been realized. It has failed to extract very much of
use from cognitive mechanisms and has remained with the standard
methodological paradigm of social psychology, which is a form of
comparative statics. Independent variables are defined sui generis,
dependent variables are defined ad hoc, and the studies attempt to
establish how the dependent variables differ given differences in the
independent ones. It has indeed found liberation to freely consider
cognitive variables, such as encodings and attitudes, and to refer to
Processes such as storage and retrieval, but the underlying models
of the social human are a mere shadow of what they need to be.
They need to engage the symbol-level mechanisms that give shape
and constraint to the close-in dynamics of social actions.

Do unified theories of cognition offer interesting Prospects? That
is the question to be asked all along the frontier. [t seems a harder
question to deal with for the social band than for either language or
development. That is not surprising, perhaps, given that the social
band involves substantial integrations beyond the cognitive band,
whereas both language and development are within the cognitive
band itself. No strong case can be made yet that unified theories of
cognition provide any special leverage—no stronger than the gen-
eral faith that symbol-level models of the individual must ultimately
provide the foundation for understanding much of social action.
However, it may be useful to note how deeply some aspects of the
lower band penetrate into the social band.

One feature of the social band is that all social action is embedded
within nonsocial technologies—within nonsociat worlds. Without a
theory of that world, the particular mechanisms that are the focus
of social effects are thin, isolated strands. They are so disjointed
and isolated that no coherent theory can be built up. At every stage
the connections are dependent upon some support in terms of the
physical environment or the task structure. As we noted in Chapter
3, there seem,some reasons to doubt the strength of the systems
levels above the intendedly rational level, that is, above the level
where the components are individually intelligent. The disjoint-
edness of the social band is real, a reflection of the essential open-
ness of systems at that level to influences from below. “‘A horse, a
horse, my kingdom for a horse!" implies that without a theory of
horses there can be no theory of kingdoms. If such is the case
