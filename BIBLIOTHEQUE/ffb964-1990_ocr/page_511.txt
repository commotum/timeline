involved—not just memory, not just decision making, not just per-
ception, but all of them, in a way integrated enough to produce the
answers in the applied domain. This proposition says that unified
theories of cognition are exactly what are needed to make progress
in building an applied cognitive psychology.

To illustrate this, consider human-computer interaction (HCD).
Recall from Chapter ! (Figures 1-9 and 1-10) that one of my own
precursors of the current attempt at unified theories of cognition
was the work with Stu Card and Tom Moran on what we called the
Mode! Human Processor (MHP), an attempt at a tough-cut, broad-
spectrum theory of the user (Card, Moran, & Newell, 1983). It was
intended to cover all the activities that a user exhibits when work-
ing at a modern display-oriented interface, such as a personal com-
puter or workstation, as listed in Figure 8-11.

During the course of this book, we've gotten Soar to cover a
number of the activities in this figure (those above the line). Actu-
ally, we did not explicitly cover the performance of routine cogni-
tive skills involved in using command languages, such as text
editors, which occupied a central role in the earlier work as the
GOMS model and the Keystroke-level model. But that sort of
routine cognitive skill, consisting of a succession of short (~~10
sec) unit tasks, with clear task phases (get the next task, locate the
place to modify, make the modification, verify if necessary) fits
easily within the multiple problem spaces of Soar. An operator
corresponds to a task, such as edit-manuscript, which requires im-
plementation by subspaces of more specialized operators (get-next-
edit, make-edit, verify, and get-next-page}, and so on. Indeed, the
stimulus-response compatibility methods of Chapter 5 are the ex-
