psychologists so seldom adopt paradigms that reveal within-trial
transfer, preferring instead paradigms with a pretest, followed bya
learning session, followed by a posttest, in which all opportunity for
using the learned material in the learning session is carefully ex-
cluded. The main exception is the standard practice situation where
improvement occurs over a sequence of trials. This setup involves
across-trial transfer, since almost always each trial in the sequence
differs in some way. Soar exhibits this practice effect. Soar has also
exhibited across-task transfer, which is the classical paradigm of
learning in one situation and testing in another. Learning in the
blocks world (Figure 4-14) is an example, although the data was not
presented in the standard way.

Learning is a process of knowledge transfer—knowledge from
some source becomes part of some target system. For chunking,
the source is the experience that occurs in a problem space, and the
knowledge (of what is effective to resolve a specific impasse) is
transferred to production memory. This experience is an internal
knowledge source. Soar can also learn from external knowledge
sources—from advice, from examples, from definitions of tasks.
(These will be illustrated below.)

By now Soar has learned almost all the kinds of things that are of
interest in AE systems, in at least some form—though often in
elementary embodiments. It has learned operator implementation,
operator instantiation, and macro-operators. It has learned to do
