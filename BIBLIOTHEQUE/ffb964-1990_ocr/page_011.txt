hhow it should progress. But, in fact. Herb has his reservations,
about Soar, which reflect a general skepticism about the fruitfulness

the major scientific action is, That's fine with me: Herb sill must
share in the responsibility for a large number of the scientific ideas
that are welded into Soar.
