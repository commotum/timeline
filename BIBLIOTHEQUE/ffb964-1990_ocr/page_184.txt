about what actions should be taken. It must be able both to repre-
sent an action, without taking it, and to represent that an action
should be taken, again without taking it. This latter may be a little
less obvious, but if it were not possible, how could deliberation of
what should happen occur? Furthermore, since it is the architecture
that finatly actually takes an action (even an operator, which is an
internal action), there must be an architecturally defined and under-
stood communication about what action to take. Preferences are
Soar's means of such communication. Preferences will also ac-
cumulate during the elaboration phase.

The production in Figure 4-4 had a preference on its right-hand
side that was put into working memory when the production fired.
Figure 4-6 shows a possible collection of preferences that could be
in working memory at the end of a given elaboration phase. A
decision cycle takes place in the context of a stack of earlier deci-
sions about goals, problem spaces, states, and operators (and called
the context stack), as shown at the top of the figure (the arrows
between the contexts in the stack will become clear in a minute),
