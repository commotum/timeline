genesis of encoding and decoding productions. The hypothesis
claims they arise from chunking, just as do the productions of cen- _
tral cognition. After all, E-productions and D-productions are just
productions. Why should they arise any differently from the way
other productions arise, namely chunking? The only feature that
distinguishes C-productions is that they are tied to the goal stack
indirectly by the connectivity constraint. .
Consider then a new chunk about to be built. It will be a
C-production, if its conditions specify goal-context elements or
specify links to linked elements. But if the implicit generalization
involved in its creation abstracts away from the goal-context stack,
then it could become some other kind of production, say an
E-production or a D-production. What happens depends upon the
abstraction that occurs when the chunk is created (by implicit gen-
eralization). This, in turn, depends on the details of the Tepresenta-
tion and the problem solving, as was emphasized in the discussion
of chunking in Section 4.2. It is at least plausible that under the
appropriate conditions, chunks will get free of the goal context and
become free-floating E-productions and D-productions.’® Many de-

ready arise, although they usually indicate overgeneraiization errors,
