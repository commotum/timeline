Intendedly Rational Behavior = 377

forever diverge from the person’s behavior. But some of the lower-
level units, PC especially, are scientific puzzles in their own right.
Thus, what is being avoided is not just the effort of programming up
the operators, but putting another scientific problem on the critical
path to the main scientific question, which is the nature of search
control in complex problem solving.

Of course, the question of the operators and their problem spaces
is of equal scientific importance, even if tactically it is useful to
bypass it for a while. A major feature of a unified theory of cogni-
tion is vertical integration. Soar must be able to provide a theory of
PC, AV, GN, and TD, But that is not the end of it. PC involves a
mixture of arithmetic, inferencing, and selection of what result to
obtain. All these elements are present in deriving G equals | or 2
when the carry-in is unknown (in column 5). The context in which
PC is accomplished is the set of arithmetic procedures for adding up
two multidigit numbers. The person's behavior here ties in with his
behavior in other tasks, such as multidigit subtraction (VanLehn,
1983) and single-digit addition and subtraction (Siegler, 1987).
These latter processes operate at the level of stimulus-response
compatibility and choice-reaction times, as discussed in Chapter 5.
Vertical integration links problem solving with immediate cognitive
behavior. Unfortunately, these steps have not yet been taken for
cryptarithmetic in Soar, so we cannot use it to illustrate this unifi-
cation.

An interesting feature of this search-control system is the use of a
small, fixed collection of control symbols, new, contradiction, un-
known, and unclear. These symbols encode in declarative form the
momentary state of knowledge about the problem solving in order
to control behavior. A set of four discrete symbols seems like a
highly artificial scheme, for we would expect a person to have a
much more articulated and fine-grained sense of evaluation and
control. This is belied to the extent that the actual behavior of the
person can be seen to be determined by just such a simple control
scheme. An interesting possibility is that a person creates a set of
control signals for a specific situation and that these symbols are
elaborated only as necessary for the task at hand.

5. If there is any doubt about this, think of an error as a hint; for example, suppose
that S3 was told that £ = 9 was correct.
