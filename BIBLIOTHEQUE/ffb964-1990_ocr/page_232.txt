problem." If the problem is approached with the right formulation,
then the chunks that Soar creates are the equivalent of a deliber-
ately coded constraint compiler. That is, if one takes productions to
be the target language into which the compiler works, then the
productions produced by chunking, given the experience of solving
the constraint problem, are exactly the productions that should be
produced by such a compiler. The point is that chunking is emerg-
ing as a powerful and natural way to convert experience into future
capability.

The last item in Figure 4-22 is interacting with the external world,
which we have glossed over—how Soar acquires tasks, how it
affects the world, how it gets feedback, and so on. In describing the
total cognitive system (Figure 4-15), we discussed the underlying
architecture for interaction with the external world. But there must
also be substantial knowledge about how to accomplish the interac-
tion collected in problem spaces. Soar can take outside guidance by
using chunking (Golding, Rosenbloom, & Laird, 1987), requesting
some information from an external user that will help it make a
choice, and then incorporating that information into itself by chunk-
ing. There is also a version of Soar, TAQ-Soar, that takes external
specifications of a task and builds the internal problem spaces re-
quired to perform that task (Yost, 1988), It interprets the input
language, creates internal representations of what the expressions
mean, and then by executing the task interpretively creates the
chunks that implement these spaces, just as if some person had
written down the productions directly (which is how most Soar
systems have been constructed up to now). We will see more of
TAQ later. Finally, a recent version of Soar, Robo-Soar, does a
simple robotic task, viewing an external set of blocks with a TV
camera and giving commands to a Puma arm to move the blocks
(Laird, Yager, Tuck, & Hucka, 1989). The vision and robot-arm
software are the P and M modules (Figure 4-15) that communicate
with central cognition via working memory. The main point for us
here in these systems is that interfacing with the external world is
something that Soar performs, just as it performs other tasks.

Thus, there is considerable evidence that Soar can exhibit intelli-
gent behavior. The evidence is as good as is available in AI at the
