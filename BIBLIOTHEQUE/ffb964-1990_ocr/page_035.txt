22 = Unified Theories of Cognition

ing, but by and large this nonidentifiability enterprise seems to me
misplaced. It arises from a narrow focus on the data admitted to
identify a theory. The way to solve the identifiability problem is by
bringing to bear large, diverse collections of quasi-independent
sources of knowledge—structural, behavioral, functional—that
finally allow the system to be pinned down. The more unified the
theory, the better the chances of identifiability, because then the
chance of being able to bring diverse sources of knowledge to bear
is greater.

Related to identifiability is the amortization of theoretical con-
structs. If a microtheory is proposed, such as the ones early in this
chapter, the data must bear the full weight of establishing all the
theoretical propositions and constructs. There can be too many
degrees of qualitative freedom in specifying the structure of a the-
ory, just as truly as there can be too many free parameters to be
determined by the available data. When a theory stands in isolation,
this almost always occurs, though often it is passed over in silence.
On the other hand, if the basic propositions about the nature of
problem spaces or the nature of control structures were part of a
common theory, then any particular local use of the theory would
not burden the data with justifying these aspects of the theory. The
data can be used, properly, to deal with the new theoretical wrin-
kle, or to estimate parameters, or whatever.

Unified theories open the way for application. It is not that psy-
chology does not have applied areas already; it certainly does. But
in many areas of application a wide variety of aspects enter into
each applied problem. What is required is not just an aptitude or
selection test. Rather, memory, perception, motor behavior, prob-
lem solving, skill acquisition—all are involved in a single attempt to
use psychology to solve an applied problem. In an area in which I
have done some work, humans interacting with computers, the

| situation is certainly this way. Without a theory that puts it all

together, application is limited to empirical techniques.

The final two items in the list may seem a little special. Changing
psychological theorizing from a discriminating to an approximating
style is a benefit 1 believe attends unified theories. This is a distinc-
tion that is rarely the subject of attention. In psychology, a theory is
treated primarily as something to be shown right or wrong. One
searches for the experimental test—the so-called crucial experi-
ment, Whatever aspect presents itself, however arcane, will do.
