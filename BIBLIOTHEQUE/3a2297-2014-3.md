# Neural Turing Machines (2014)

## Core reasons
- Proposes a neural architecture that couples a controller to external memory with attention-based read/write operations, extending computation beyond standard feedforward/recurrent processing.
- Frames the contribution as a differentiable mechanism for algorithmic tasks by adding an explicit, addressable memory component.

## Evidence extracts
- "We extend the capabilities of neural networks by coupling them to external memory re- sources, which they can interact with by attentional processes." (Abstract)
- "During each update cycle, the controller network receives inputs from an external environment and emits outputs in response. It also reads to and writes from a memory matrix via a set of parallel read and write heads." (Figure 1)
