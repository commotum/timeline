                            Memory-basedneural networks model temporal data by leveraging an ability to
                            rememberinformation for long periods. It is unclear, however, whether they also
                            have an ability to perform complex relational reasoning with the information they
                            remember. Here, we ﬁrst conﬁrm our intuitions that standard memory architectures
                            maystruggle at tasks that heavily involve an understanding of the ways in which
                            entities are connected – i.e., tasks involving relational reasoning. We then improve
                            uponthese deﬁcits by using a new memory module – a Relational Memory Core
                           (RMC)–whichemploysmulti-headdot product attention to allow memories to
                            interact. Finally, we test the RMC on a suite of tasks that may proﬁt from more
                            capable relational reasoning across sequential information, and show large gains

                     1  Introduction
       arXiv:1806.01822v2  [cs.LG]  28 Jun 2018Humansusesophisticated memory systems to access and reason about important information regard-
                     less of when it was initially perceived [1, 2]. In neural network research many successful approaches
                     to modeling sequential data also use memory systems, such as LSTMs [3] and memory-augmented
                     neural networks generally [4–7]. Bolstered by augmented memory capacities, bounded computational
                     costs over time, and an ability to deal with vanishing gradients, these networks learn to correlate
                     events across time to be proﬁcient at storing and retrieving information.
                     Here we propose that it is fruitful to consider memory interactions along with storage and retrieval.
                     Although current models can learn to compartmentalize and relate distributed, vectorized memories,
                     they are not biased towards doing so explicitly. We hypothesize that such a bias may allow a model
                     to better understand how memories are related, and hence may give it a better capacity for relational
                     reasoning over time. We begin by demonstrating that current models do indeed struggle in this
                     domain by developing a toy task to stress relational reasoning of sequential information. Using a new
                     Relational Memory Core (RMC), which uses multi-head dot product attention to allow memories to
                     interact with each other, we solve and analyze this toy problem. We then apply the RMC to a suite
                     of tasks that may proﬁt from more explicit memory-memory interactions, and hence, a potentially
                     Preprint. Work in progress.

                                  2    Relational reasoning
                                  We take relational reasoning to be the process of understanding the ways in which entities are
                                  connected and using this understanding to accomplish some higher order goal [8]. For example,
                                  consider sorting the distances of various trees to a park bench: the relations (distances) between the
                                  entities (trees and bench) are compared and contrasted to produce the solution, which could not be
                                  reached if one reasoned about the properties (positions) of each individual entity in isolation.
                                  Since we can often quite ﬂuidly deﬁne what constitutes an “entity” or a “relation”, one can imagine a
                                  spectrum of neural network inductive biases that can be cast in the language of relational reasoning
                                  1.  For example, a convolutional kernel can be said to compute a relation (linear combination)
                                  of the entities (pixels) within a receptive ﬁeld. Some previous approaches make the relational
                                  inductive bias more explicit: in message passing neural networks [e.g. 9–12], the nodes comprise
                                  the entities and relations are computed using learnable functions applied to nodes connected with
                                  an edge, or sometimes reducing the relational function to a weighted sum of the source entities [e.g.
                                 13, 14]. In Relation Networks [15–17] entities are obtained by exploiting spatial locality in the input
                                  image, and the model focuses on computing binary relations between each entity pair. Even further,
                                  some approaches emphasize that more capable reasoning may be possible by employing simple
                                  computational principles; by recognizing that relations might not always be tied to proximity in space,
                                  non-local computations may be better able to capture the relations between entities located far away
                                  from each other [18, 19].
                                  In the temporal domain relational reasoning could comprise a capacity to compare and contrast
                                  information seen at different points in time [20]. Here, attention mechanisms [e.g. 21, 22] implicitly
                                  perform some form of relational reasoning; if previous hidden states are interpreted as entities, then
                                  computing a weighted sum of entities using attention helps to remove the locality bias present in
                                  vanilla RNNs, allowing embeddings to be better related using content rather than proximity.
                                  Since our current architectures solve complicated temporal tasks they must have some capacity for
                                  temporal relational reasoning. However, it is unclear whether their inductive biases are limiting, and
                                  whether these limitations can be exposed with tasks demanding particular types of temporal relational
                                  reasoning. For example, memory-augmented neural networks [4–7] solve a compartmentalization
                                  problem with a slot-based memory matrix, but may have a harder time allowing memories to interact,
                                  or relate, with one another once they are encoded. LSTMs [3, 23], on the other hand, pack all
                                  information into a common hidden memory vector, potentially making compartmentalization and
                                  relational reasoning more difﬁcult.
                                  3    Model
                                  Ourguiding design principle is to provide an architectural backbone upon which a model can learn
                                  to compartmentalize information, and learn to compute interactions between compartmentalized
                                  information. To accomplish this we assemble building blocks from LSTMs, memory-augmented
                                  neural networks, and non-local networks (in particular, the Transformer seq2seq model [22]). Similar
                                  to memory-augmented architectures we consider a ﬁxed set of memory slots; however, we allow for
                                  interactions between memory slots using an attention mechanism. As we will describe, in contrast to
                                  previous work we apply attention between memories at a single time step, and not across all previous
                                  representations computed from all previous observations.
                                  3.1    Allowing memories to interact using multi-head dot product attention
                                  Wewill ﬁrst assume that we do not need to consider memory encoding; that is, that we already
                                  have some stored memories in matrix M, with row-wise compartmentalized memories m . To allow
                                                                                                                                              i
                                  memories to interact we employ multi-head dot product attention (MHDPA) [22], also known as
                                      1Indeed, in the broadest sense any multivariable function must be considered “relational.”

                                           Figure 1: Relational Memory Core. (a) The RMC receives a previous memory matrix and input
                                          vector as inputs, which are passed to the MHDPA module labeled with an “A”. (b). Linear projections
                                           are computed for each memory slot, and input vector, using row-wise shared weights Wq for the
                                           queries, Wk for the keys, and Wv for the values. (c) The queries, keys, and values are then compiled
                                           into matrices and softmax(QKT)V is computed. The output of this computation is a new memory
                                          where information is blended across memories based on their attention weights. An MLP is applied
                                           row-wise to the output of the MHDPA module (a), and the resultant memory matrix is gated, and
                                           passed on as the core output or next memory state.
                                           self-attention. Using MHDPA, each memory will attend over all of the other memories, and will
                                           update its content based on the attended information.
                                           First, a simple linear projection is used to construct queries (Q = MWq), keys (K = MWk), and
                                          values (V = MWv) for each memory (i.e. row m ) in matrix M. Next, we use the queries, Q, to
                                                                                                                          i
                                           perform a scaled dot-product attention over the keys, K. The returned scalars can be put through a
                                           softmax-function to produce a set of weights, which can then be used to return a weighted average
                                                                                                                QKT

                                          The output of Aθ(M), which we will denote as M, is a matrix with the same dimensionality as
                                                  f
                                           M. M canbeinterpreted as a proposed update to M, with each me comprising information from
                                                                                                                                                    i
                                           memories m . Thus, in one step of attention each memory is updated with information originating
                                                              j
                                           from other memories, and it is up to the model to learn (via parameters Wq, Wk, and Wv) how to
                                           shuttle information from memory to memory.
                                          As implied by the name, MHDPA uses multiple heads. We implement this producing h sets of
                                           queries, keys, and values, using unique parameters to compute a linear projection from the original
                                           memoryfor each head h. We then independently apply an attention operation for each head. For
                                           example, if M is an N ×F dimensional matrix and we employ two attention heads, then we compute

                                          where [:] denotes column-wise concatenation. Intuitively, heads could be useful for letting a memory
                                           share different information, to different targets, using each head.

                           encoded as new inputs are received. Suppose then that M is some randomly initialised memory. We
                           can efﬁciently incorporate new information x into M with a simple modiﬁcation to equation 1:
                                                   f             MWq([M;x]Wk)T                   v
                                                   M=softmax               √ k            [M;x]W ,                        (2)
                                                                             d
                           where we use [M;x] to denote the row-wise concatenation of M and x. Since we use [M;x] when
                                                                                                     f
                           computing the keys and values, and only M when computing the queries, M is a matrix with same
                           dimensionality as M. Thus, equation 2 is a memory-size preserving attention operation that includes
                           attention over the memories and the new observations. Notably, we use the same attention operation
                           to efﬁciently compute memory interactions and to incorporate new information.
                           Wealsonotethepossible utility of this operation when the memory consists of a single vector rather
                           than a matrix. In this case the model may learn to pick and choose which information from the input
                           should be written into the vector memory state by learning how to attend to the input, conditioned
                           on what is contained in the memory already. This is possible in LSTMs via the gates, though at a
                           different granularity. We return to this idea, and the possible compartmentalization that can occur via
                           the heads even in the single-memory-slot case, in the discussion.

                                                                                                                           f
                           Suppose we have a temporal dimension with new observations at each timestep, xt. Since M and M
                           are the same dimensionality, we can naively introduce recurrence by ﬁrst randomly initialising M,
                                                     f
                           and then updating it with M at each timestep. We chose to do this by embedding this update into an
                           LSTM.SupposememorymatrixM canbeinterpretedasamatrixofcellstates,usuallydenotedasC,

                           Sonnet library 2, and for the exact formulation we used, including our choice for the g  function
                                                                                                                  ψ
                           (brieﬂy, we found a row/memory-wise MLP with layer normalisation to work best). There is also an
                           interesting opportunity to introduce a different kind of gating, which we call ‘memory’ gating, which
                           resembles previous gating ideas [24, 3]. Instead of producing scalar gates for each individual unit
                           (‘unit’ gating), we can produce scalar gates for each memory row by converting Wf, Wi, Wo, Uf,
                           Ui, and Uo from weight matrices into weight vectors, and by replacing the element-wise product in
                           the gating equations with scalar-vector multiplication.
                           Since parameters Wf, Wi, Wo, Uf, Ui, Uo, and ψ are shared for each mi, we can modify the
                           number of memories without affecting the number of parameters. Thus, tuning the number of
                           memories and the size of each memory can be used to balance the overall storage capacity (equal
                           to the total number of units, or elements, in M) and the number of parameters (proportional to the
                           dimensionality of m ). We ﬁnd in our experiments that some tasks require more, but not necessarily
                                               i
                           larger, memories, and others such as language modeling require fewer, larger memories.

                                             Figure 2: Tasks. We tested the RMC on a suite of supervised and reinforcement learning tasks.
                                             Notable are the Nth Farthest toy task and language modeling. In the former, the solution requires
                                             explicit relational reasoning since the model must sort distance relations between vectors, and not the
                                             vectors themselves. The latter tests the model on a large quantity of natural data and allows us to
                                             compare performance to well-tuned models.
                                            Thus, we have a number of tune-able parameters: the number of memories, the size of each memory,
                                             the number of attention heads, the number of steps of attention, the gating method, and the post-

                                             Here we brieﬂy outline the tasks on which we applied the RMC, and direct the reader to the appendix
                                             for full details on each task and details on hyperparameter settings for the model.
                                             4.1      Illustrative supervised tasks
                                             Nth Farthest              TheNth Farthest task is designed to stress a capacity for relational reasoning across
                                             time. Inputs are a sequence of randomly sampled vectors, and targets are answers to a question of the
                                                                                th
                                             form: “What is the n                   farthest vector (in Euclidean distance) from vector m?”, where the vector
                                             values, their IDs, n, and m are randomly sampled per sequence. It is not enough to simply encode and
                                             retrieve information as in a copy task. Instead, a model must compute all pairwise distance relations
                                             to the reference vector m, which might also lie in memory, or might not have even been provided as
                                             input yet. It must then implicitly sort these distances to produce the answer. We emphasize that the
                                             model must sort distance relations between vectors, and not the vectors themselves.
                                             ProgramEvaluation TheLearningtoExecute(LTE)dataset[25]consists of algorithmic snippets
                                             from a Turing complete programming language of pseudo-code, and is broken down into three cate-
                                             gories: addition, control, and full program. Inputs are a sequence of characters over an alphanumeric
                                             vocabulary representing such snippets, and the target is a numeric sequence of characters that is
                                             the execution output for the given programmatic input. Given that the snippets involve symbolic
                                             manipulation of variables, we felt it could strain a model’s capacity for relational reasoning; since
                                             symbolic operators can be interpreted as deﬁning a relation over the operands, successful learning
                                             could reﬂect an understanding of this relation. To also assess model performance on classical se-
                                             quence tasks we also evaluated on memorization tasks, in which the output is simply a permuted
                                             form of the input rather than an evaluation from a set of operational instructions. See the appendix

                                             agent navigates a maze to collect food while being chased by ghosts. However, we implement this
                                             task with a viewport: a 5 × 5 window surrounding the agent that comprises the perceptual input. The
                                             task is therefore partially observable, since the agent must navigate the space and take in information
                                             through this viewport. Thus, the agent must predict the dynamics of the ghosts in memory, and plan
                                             its navigation accordingly, also based on remembered information about which food has already been

                           called BoxWorld, which demands relational reasoning in memory space.
                           4.3  LanguageModeling
                           Finally, we investigate the task of word-based language modeling. We model the conditional prob-
                           ability p(wt|w<t) of a word wt given a sequence of observed words w<t = (wt−1,wt−2,...,w1).
                           Language models can be directly applied to predictive keyboard and search-phrase completion,
                           or they can be used as components within larger systems, e.g. machine translation [27], speech
                           recognition [28], and information retrieval [29]. RNNs, and most notably LSTMs, have proven to be
                           state-of-the-art on many competitive language modeling benchmarks such as Penn Treebank [30, 31],
                           WikiText-103 [32, 33], and the One Billion Word Benchmark [34, 35]. As a sequential reasoning
                           task, language modeling allows us to assess the RMC’s ability to process information over time on a
                           large quantity of natural data, and compare it to well-tuned models.
                           Wefocusondatasetswithcontiguoussentencesandamoderatelylargeamountofdata. WikiText-103
                           satisﬁes this set of requirements as it consists of Wikipedia articles shufﬂed at the article level with
                           roughly 100M training tokens, as do two stylistically different sources of text data: books from
                                            3
                           Project Gutenberg and news articles from GigaWord v5 [36]. Using the same processing from [32]
                           these datasets consist of 180M training tokens and 4B training tokens respectively, thus they cover
                           a range of styles and corpus sizes. We choose a similar vocabulary size for all three datasets of
                           approximately 250,000, which is large enough to include rare words and numeric values.
                           5   Results
                           5.1  Nth Farthest
                           This task revealed a stark difference between our LSTM and DNC baselines and RMC when training
                           on 16-dimensional vector inputs. Both LSTM and DNC models failing to surpass 30% best batch
                           accuracy and the RMC consistently achieving 91% at the end of training (see ﬁgure 5 in the appendix
                           for training curves). The RMC achieved similar performance when the difﬁculty of the task was
                           increased by using 32-dimensional vectors, placing a greater demand on high-ﬁdelity memory storage.
                           However, this performance was less robust with only a small number of seeds/model conﬁgurations
                           demonstrating this performance, in contrast to the 16-dimensional vector case where most model
                           conﬁgurations succeeded.
                           Anattention analysis revealed some notable features of the RMC’s internal functions. Figure 3 shows
                           attention weights in the RMC’s memory throughout a sequence: the ﬁrst row contains a sequence
                           where the reference vector m was observed last; in the second row it was observed ﬁrst; and in the
                           last row it was observed in the middle of the sequence. Before m is seen the model seems to shuttle
                           input information into one or two memory slots, as shown by the high attention weights from these
                           slots’ queries to the input key. After m is seen, most evident in row three of the ﬁgure, the model
                           tends to change its attention behaviour, with all the memory slots preferentially focusing attention
                           on those particular memories to which the m was written. Although this attention analysis provides
                           some useful insights, the conclusions we can make are limited since even after a single round of
                           attention the memory can become highly distributed, making any interpretations about information
                           compartmentalisation potentially inaccurate.
                           5.2  ProgramEvaluation
                           Program evaluation performance was assessed via the Learning to Execute tasks [25]. We evaluated
                           a number of baselines alongside the RMC including an LSTM [3, 37], DNC [5], and a bank of
                           LSTMsresemblingRecurrent Entity Networks [38] (EntNet) - the conﬁgurations for each of these is
                           described in the appendix. Best test batch accuracy results are shown in Table 1. The RMC performs
                           at least as well as all of the baselines on each task. It is marginally surpassed by a small fraction of
                           performance on the double memorization task, but both models effectively solve this task. Further,
                           the results of the RMC outperform all equivalent tasks from [25] which use teacher forcing even when
                           evaluating model performance. It’s worth noting that we observed better results when we trained in a

                                 provided to the model as an input. We mark in red the vector that is referenced in the task: e.g., if the

                                 input to the model is depicted in red. A single attention matrix shows the attention weights from one
                                 particular memory slot (y-axis) to another memory slot (columns), or the input (offset column), with
                                 the numbers denoting the memory slot and “input” denoting the input embedding.
                                 non-auto-regressive fashion - that is, with no teacher forcing during training. This is likely related to
                                 the effect that relaxing the ground truth requirement has on improving model generalization [39] and
                                 hence, performance. It is perhaps more pronounced in these tasks due to the independence of output
                                 token probabilities and also the sharply uni-modal nature of the output distribution (that is, there is
                                 noambiguity in the answer given the program).

                           5.3  Mini-Pacman
                           In Mini Pacman with viewport the RMC achieved approximately 100 points more than an LSTM
                           (677 vs. 550), and when trained with the full observation the RMC nearly doubled the performance
                           of an LSTM (1159 vs. 598, ﬁgure 10).
                           5.4  LanguageModeling
                           For all three language modeling tasks we observe lower perplexity when using the relational memory
                           core, with a drop of 1.4 − 5.4 perplexity over the best published results. Although small, this
                           constitutes a 5 − 12% relative improvement and appears to be consistent across tasks of varying
                           size and style. For WikiText-103, we see this can be compared to LSTM architectures [5, 32],
                           convolutional models [42] and hybrid recurrent-convolutional models [43].
                           Themodellearns with a slightly better data efﬁciency than an LSTM (appendix ﬁgure 11). The RMC
                           scored highly when the number of context words provided during evaluation were relatively few,
                           comparedtoanLSTMwhichproﬁtedmuchmorefromalargercontext(supplementaryﬁgure12).
                           This could be because RMC better captures short-term relations, and hence only needs a relatively
                           small context for accurate modeling. Inspecting the perplexity broken down by word frequency in
                           supplementary table 3, we see the RMC improved the modeling of frequent words, and this is where
                           the drop in overall perplexity is obtained.
                           6   Discussion
                           Anumberofotherapproacheshaveshownsuccessinmodelingsequentialinformation by using a
                           growing buffer of previous states [21, 22]. These models better capture long-distance interactions,
                           since their computations are not biased by temporally local proximity. However, there are serious
                           scaling issues for these models when the number of timesteps is large, or even unbounded, such as
                           in online reinforcement learning (e.g., in the real world). Thus, some decisions need to be made
                           regarding the size of the past-embedding buffer that should be stored, whether it should be a rolling
                           window, how computations should be cached and propagated across time, etc. These considerations
                           make it difﬁcult to directly compare these approaches in these online settings. Nonetheless, we
                           believe that a blend of purely recurrent approaches with those that scale with time could be a fruitful
                           pursuit: perhaps the model accumulates memories losslessly for some chunk of time, then learns to
                           compress it in a recurrent core before moving onto processing a subsequent chunk.
                           Weproposed intuitions for the mechanisms that may better equip a model for complex relational
                           reasoning. Namely, by explicitly allowing memories to interact either with each other, with the
                           input, or both via MHDPA, we demonstrated improved performance on tasks demanding relational
                           reasoning across time. We would like to emphasize, however, that while these intuitions guided our
                           design of the model, and while the analysis of the model in the Nth farthest task aligned with our
                           intuitions, we cannot necessarily make any concrete claims as to the causal inﬂuence of our design
                           choices on the model’s capacity for relational reasoning, or as to the computations taking place within
                           the model and how they may map to traditional approaches for thinking about relational reasoning.
                           Thus, we consider our results primarily as evidence of improved function – if a model can better
                           solve tasks that require relational reasoning, then it must have an increased capacity for relational
                           reasoning, even if we do not precisely know why it may have this increased capacity. In this light the
                           RMCmaybeusefullyviewedfrommultiplevantages, and these vantages may offer ideas for further
                           improvements.
                           Our model has multiple mechanisms for forming and allowing for interactions between memory
                           vectors: slicing the memory matrix row-wise into slots, and column-wise into heads. Each has its
                           own advantages (computations on slots share parameters, while having more heads and a larger
                           memorysize takes advantage of more parameters). We don’t yet understand the interplay, but we
                           note some empirical ﬁndings. First, in the the Nth farthest task a model with a single memory slot
                           performed better when it had more attention heads, though in all cases it performed worse than a
                           model with many memory slots. Second, in language modeling, our model used a single memory
                           slot. The reasons for choosing a single memory here were mainly due to the need for a large number
                           of parameters for LM in general (hence the large size for the single memory slot), and the inability to
                           quickly run a model with both a large number of parameters and multiple memory slots. Thus, we do
                                                                          8
           not necessarily claim that a single memory slot is best for language modeling, rather, we emphasize
           an interesting trade-off between number of memories and individual memory size, which may be
           a task speciﬁc ratio that can be tuned. Moreover, in program evaluation, an intermediate solution
           workedwellacross subtasks (4 slots and heads), though some performed best with 1 memory, and
           others with 8.
           Altogether, our results show that explicit modeling of memory interactions improves performance in
           a reinforcement learning task, alongside program evaluation, comparative reasoning, and language
           modeling, demonstrating the value of instilling a capacity for relational reasoning in recurrent neural
           networks.

                             In the following sections we provide further details on the experiments and the model conﬁgurations. We will
                             sometimes refer to the following terms when describing the model:
                                    • “total units”: The total number of elements in the memory matrix M. Equivalent to the size of each
                                       memorymultiplied by the number of memories.
                                    • “numheads”: The number of attention heads; i.e., the number of unique sets of queries, keys, and
                                       values produced for the memories.
                                    • “memoryslots” or “number of memories”: Equivalent to the number of rows in matrix M.
                                    • “numblocks”: The number of iterations of attention performed at each time-step.
                                    • “gate style”: Gating per unit or per memory slot
                             A.1    Nth Farthest
                             Inputs consisted of sequences of eight randomly sampled, 16-dimensional vectors from a uniform distribution
                             x ∼ U(−1,1), and vector labels l ∼ {1,2,...,8}, encoded as a one-hot vectors and sampled without
                              t                                  t
                             replacement. Labels were sampled and hence did not correspond to the time-points at which the vectors were
                             presented to the model. Appended to each vector-label input was the task speciﬁcation (i.e., the values of n and
                             mforthat sequence), also encoded as one-hot vectors. Thus, an input for time-step t was a 40-dimensional
                             vector (x ;l ;n;m).

                             For all models (RMC, LSTM, DNC) we used the Adam optimiser [44] with a batch size of 1600, learning rates
                             tuned between 1e−5 and 1e−3, and trained using a softmax cross entropy loss function. All the models had
                             an equivalent 4-layer MLP (256 units per layer with ReLu non-linearities) to process their outputs to produce
                             logits for the softmax. Learning rate did not seem to inﬂuence performance, so we settled on 1e−4 for the ﬁnal
                             experiments.
                             For the LSTM and DNC, architecture parameters seemingly made no difference to model performance. For the

                             128, 512, or 1024 memory sizes (which we tied to the controller LSTM size), and 1, 2, or 4 memory reads &
                             writes. The DNC used a 2-layer LSTM controller.
                             For the RMC we used 1, 8, or 16 memories with 2048 total units (so, the size of each memory was   2048  ),
                                                                                                                             num_mems
                             1, 8, or 16 heads, 1 block of attention, and both the ‘unit’ and ‘memory’ gating methods. Figure 4 shows the
                             results of a hyperparameter sweep scaled according to wall-clock time (models with more but smaller memories
                             are faster to run than those with fewer but larger memories, and we chose to compare models with equivalent
                             numberoftotal units in the memory matrix M).
                             A.2    ProgramEvaluation
                             Tofurther study the effect of relational structure on working memory and symbolic representation we turned
                             to a set of problems that provided insights into the RMC’s ﬁtness as a generalized computational model. The
                             Learning to Execute (LTE) dataset [25] provided a good starting point for assessing the power of our model
                             over this class of problems. Sample problems are of the form of linear time, constant memory, mini-programs.
                             Training samples were generated in batches of 128 on-the-ﬂy. Each model was trained for 200K iterations using
                                                                      −3
                             an Adamoptimiser and learning rate of 1e    . The samples were parameterized by literal length and nesting
                             depth which deﬁne the length of terminal values in the program snippets and the level of program operation
                             nesting. Within each batch the literal length and nesting value was sampled uniformly up to the maximum value
                             for each - this is consistent with the Mix curriculum strategy from [25]. We evaluated the model against a batch
                             of 12800 samples using the maximum nesting and literal length values for all samples and report the top score.
                             Examples of samples for each task can be found in ﬁgure 6 and ﬁgure 7. It also worth noting that the modulus
                             operation was applied to addition, control, and full program samples so as to bound the output to the maximum
                             literal length in case of longer for-loops.
                             The sequential model consists of an encoder and a decoder which each take the form of a recurrent neural
                             network [45, 25]. Once the encoder has processed the input sequence the state of the encoder is used to initialize
                             the decoder state and subsequently to generate the target sequence (program output). The output from all
                             models is passed through a 4-layer MLP - all layers have size 256 with an output ReLU - to generate an output
                             embedding at each step of the output sequence.
                             In [25] teacher forcing is used for both training and testing in the decode phase. For our experiments, we began
                             byexploring teacher forcing during training but used model predictions from the previous step as input to the
                             the decoder at the next step when evaluating the model [45]. We also considered the potential effect of limiting
                                                                                13

                     a clear effect with the number of memories, with 8 or 16 memories being better than 1. Interestingly,

                     regime where model predictions only were used during training. It turned out that this approach tended to yield
                     the strongest results.
                     Following are the encoder/decoder conﬁgurations for a collection of memory models that performed best over all
                     tasks. With the RMC we swept over two and four memories, and two and four attention heads, a total memory
                     size of 1024 and 2048 (divided across memories), a single pass of self attention per step and scalar memory
                     gating. For the baselines, the LSTM is a two layer model and we swept over models with 1024 and 2048 units
                     per layer, skip connections and layer-wise outputs concatenated on the ﬁnal layer. The DNC used a memory size
                     of 80, word size 64, four read heads and one write head, a 2-layer controller sweeping over 128, 256 and 512
                     latent units per layer, larger settings than this tended to hurt performance. Also for the DNC, an LSTM controller
                     is used for Program Evaluation problems, and feed-forward controller for memorization. Finally, the EntNet was
                     compared with a total memory size of either 1024 or 2048 with 2, 4, 6, or 8 memory cells where total memory
                     size is divided among memories and the states of the cells are summed to produce an output. All results reported
                     are from the strongest performing hyper-parameter setting for the given model.

                       with respect to total memory size over number of memories and consequently the top performing LSTM models
                       contained many more parameters than the top performing RMC models.

                       that demands relational reasoning-based planning, initially developed in [46]. It consists of a grid of 14 × 14
                       pixels: grey pixels denote the background, lone colored pixels are keys that can be picked up, and duples of
                       colored pixels are locks and keys, where the right pixel of the duple denotes the color of the lock (and hence
                       the color of the key that is needed to open the lock), and the left pixel denotes the color of the key that would
                       be obtained should the agent open the lock. The agent is denoted by a dark grey pixel, and has four actions:
                       up, down, left, right. To make this task demand relational reasoning in a memory space, the agent only has
                       perceptual access to a 5 × 5 RGB window, or viewport, appended with an extra frame denoting the color of the
                                                              15

              depicts per character accuracy scores from tasks with nesting = 2 and literal length = 5 while the

              Theagent, the dark grey pixel, only has access to a 5 × 5 view surrounding it (light gray area). The
              right panel shows the underlying graph that was sampled to generate the level. In this example the
              solution path has length 5 and there are 4 distractor branches.
              key currently in possession. The goal of the task is to navigate the space, observe the key-lock combinations,
              and then choose the correct key-lock sequence so as to eventually receive the rewarded gem, denoted by a white
              pixel.
              In each level there is a unique sequence of keys-lock pairs that should be traversed to reach the gem. There are a
              few important factors that make this task difﬁcult: First, keys disappear once they are used. Since we include
             ‘distractor’ branches (i.e., key lock paths that lead to a dead end), the agent must be able to look ahead, and
              reason about the appropriate path forward to the gem so as to not get stuck. Second, the location of the keys
              and locks are randomised, making this task completely devoid of any spatial biases. This emphasises a capacity
              to reason about the relations between keys and locks, in memory, based on their abstract relations, rather than
              based on their spatial positions. For this reason we suspect that CNN-based approaches may struggle, since their
              inductive biases are tied to relating things proximal in space.
              Tocollect a locked key the agent must be in possession of the matching key color (only one key can be held at a
              time) and walk over the lock, after which the lock disappears. Only then is it possible for the agent to pick up
              the adjacent key. Each level was procedurally generated, constrained to have only one unique sequence in each
              level ending with the white gem. To generate the level we ﬁrst sampled a random graph (tree) that deﬁned the
              possible paths that could be traversed, including distractor paths. An example path is shown in ﬁgure 9.

                         Weusedatotalof20keysand20locks(i.e., colors) in our sampling pool to produce each level. Three main
                         factors determined the difﬁculty of the level: (1) the path length (i.e., number of locks) to the gem; (2) the
                         numberofdistractor branches; and (3) the path lengths of the distractor branches. For training we used solution
                         path lengths of at least 1 and up to 5, ensuring that an untrained agent would have a small probability of reaching
                         the goal by chance, at least on the easier levels. We sampled the number of distractor branches to be between 0
                         and 5, with a length of 1.
                         Theviewport observation was processed through two convolutional layers, with 12 and 24 kernels, and with
                         2×2kernelsizesandastrideof1. Eachlayer used a ReLU non-linearity. We used two extra feature maps to
                         tag the convolutional output with absolute spatial position (x and y) of each pixel/cell, with the tags comprising
                         evenly spaced values between −1 and 1. The resulting stack was then passed to the RMC, containing four
                         memories, four heads, a total memory size of 1024 (divided across heads and memories), a single pass of self
                         attention per step and scalar memory gating. For the baseline, we replaced the RMC with a 5 × 5 ConvLSTM
                         with 64 output channels, with 2 × 2 kernels and stride of 1.
                         Weusedthis architecture in an actor-critic set-up, using the distributed Importance Weighted Actor-Learner
                         Architecture [47]. The agent consists of 100 actors, which generate trajectories of experience, and one learner,
                         whichdirectly learns a policy π and a baseline function V , using the actors’ experiences. The model updates
                         were performed on GPU using mini-batches of 32 trajectories provided by the actors via a queue. The agent had
                         an entropy cost of 0.005, discount (γ) of 0.99 and unroll length of 40 steps. The learning rate was tuned, taking
                         values between 1e−5 and 2e−4. Informally, we note that we could replicate these results using an A3C setup,
                         though training took longer.
                         Theagentreceived a reward of +10 for collecting the gem, +1 for opening a box in the solution path and −1 for
                         opening a distractor box. The level was terminated immediately after collecting the gem or opening a distractor
                         box.

                         sampled from 0 to 5. This agent achieved high performance in the task, correctly solving 98% of the levels after
                         1e9steps. The same agent augmented instead with a ConvLSTM performed signiﬁcantly worse, reaching only

                         have a maximum L2 norm of 0.1. Backpropagation-through-time was truncated to a window-length of 100. The
                         model was trained with 6 Nvidia Tesla P100 GPUs synchronously. Each GPU trained with a batch of 64 and so
                         the total batch size was 384. We used 512 (with 0.5 dropout) as the word embedding sizes, and tied the word
                         embedding matrix parameters to the output softmax.

                        are compared against the ‘best’ perplexity where the model is unrolled continuously over the full
                        test set. We see that both models incorporate little information beyond 500 words. Furthermore, the
