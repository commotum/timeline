# Translation (1949)
Source: 066604-1949.pdf

## Core reasons
- The memorandum proposes using electronic computers for translation and even frames translation as a cryptography problem, which is a conceptual framing rather than a machine learning model or architecture.
- It emphasizes linguistic/statistical semantics and language invariants as preliminary study directions, providing cross-disciplinary context instead of a dataset, benchmark, or ML mechanism.

## Evidence extracts
- "I have wondered if it were unthinkable to design a computer which would translate." (p. 5)
- "it is one of the chief purposes of this memorandum to emphasize that statistical semantic studies should be undertaken, as a necessary preliminary step." (p. 11)
