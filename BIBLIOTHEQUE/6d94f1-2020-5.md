# AI Feynman: A physics-inspired method for symbolic regression (2020)
Source: 6d94f1-2020.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a new symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with physics-inspired techniques, which is a methodological contribution.
- Frames symbolic regression as the central ML problem being addressed, indicating the paper's focus is on a learning method.

## Evidence extracts
- "A core challenge for both physics and artificial intelligence (AI) is symbolic regression: finding a symbolic expression
that matches data from an unknown function." (p. 1)
- "In
this spirit, we develop a recursive multidimensional symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network
fitting with a suite of physics-inspired techniques." (p. 1)
