# ViViT: A Video Vision Transformer (2021)
Source: 84149f-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes transformer-based models specifically for video, indicating an adaptation of Transformer architectures to a higher-dimensional spatio-temporal domain.
- Focuses on modeling spatial and temporal dimensions of video input, which is a domain-lifting adaptation rather than a positional encoding modification.

## Evidence extracts
- "We present pure-transformer based models for video" (p. 1)
- "spatial and temporal dimensions of the input video." (p. 2)

## Classification
Class name: Increasing Transformer's Dimensions
Class code: 2
