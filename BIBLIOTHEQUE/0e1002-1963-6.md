# Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow (1963)
Source: 0e1002-1963.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper studies deterministic nonlinear differential equations for forced dissipative hydrodynamic flow and analyzes nonperiodic solutions, which is a dynamical-systems/atmospheric science focus rather than ML.
- The main application is cellular convection and implications for weather prediction, placing it squarely in meteorology/physics context.

## Evidence extracts
- "Finite systems of deterministic ordinary nonlinear differential equations may be designed to represent forced dissipative hydrodynamic flow." (p. 1)
- "A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic." (p. 1)
