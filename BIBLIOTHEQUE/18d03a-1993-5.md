# Keeping Neural Networks Simple by Minimizing the Description Length of the Weights (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: 18d03a-1993.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper focuses on keeping neural networks simple by minimizing the description length of the weights, i.e., a learning/regularization objective based on weight information content.
- It explicitly uses the Minimum Description Length principle as the model-selection criterion, which is a foundational learning principle rather than a dataset or positional encoding change.

## Evidence extracts
- "Keeping Neural Networks Simple by Minimizing the Description Length of the Weights" (p. 1)
- "The Minimum Description Length Principle (Rissanen, 1986) asserts that the best model of some data is the one that minimizes the combined cost" (p. 6)
