# Canonical Microcircuits for Predictive Coding (2012)
Source: 2e84d5-2012.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper frames predictive coding in terms of cortical microcircuits and cortical columns, indicating a neuroscience source domain.
- It emphasizes intrinsic connections among neuronal populations and canonical microcircuit forms as biological grounding.

## Evidence extracts
- "canonical microcircuit in light of predictive coding." (p. 1)
- "for intrinsic connections among neuronal populations. By deriving canonical forms for these computations," (p. 1)
