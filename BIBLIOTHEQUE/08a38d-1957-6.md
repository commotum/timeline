# Dynamic Programming (1957)
Source: 08a38d-1957.pdf

## Core reasons
- The work explicitly presents itself as a mathematical theory of multi-stage decision processes and introduces the term "dynamic programming" for that subject matter.
- It frames dynamic programming as a general conceptual framework and mathematical tool for treating problems across disciplines, including classical analysis.

## Evidence extracts
- "The purpose of this work is to provide an introduction to the mathe- matical theory of multi-stage decision processes." (p. 6)
- "Rather, it involves a certain conceptual framework which furnishes us a new and versatile mathematical tool for the treatment of many novel and interesting problems both in this new discipline and in various parts of classical analvsis." (p. 6)
