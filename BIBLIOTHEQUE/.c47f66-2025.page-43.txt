                                 GPT-4o (Standard Setting): To identify the correct answer, we need to consider what the posters are depicting and the
                                 historical context around them. The first image is from Canada in 1918 and refers to "Victory Bonds.". The second poster is
                                 from the United States in the early 1940s and encourages car-sharing to support the war effort, referencing the fight against
                                 Nazi Germany. Analyzing the options: A. Groups like the Non-Aligned Movement were created after World War II to stay
                                 neutral during the Cold War, not directly a reaction to these wars. B. Movements promoting global disarmament may be
                                 partially relevant, though disarmament efforts became more prominent after the nuclear age began. C. The formation of
                                 global environmental organizations took prominence later, not directly linked to wars. D. Economic sanctions by major world
                                 powers have been a persistent tool but not solely a result of these conflicts. E. Movements that used violence against civilians
                                 to achieve political aims were not formed as a direct reaction to these conflicts but were more prevalent in later contexts. F.
                                 The WTO was created in 1995 for global trade regulation, not a direct result of these wars. G. International organizations to
                                 facilitate cooperation, such as the United Nations, were indeed formed in direct response to World War II, with the aim of
                                 preventing future global conflicts. H. The establishment of the League of Nations was a direct result of World War I, aimed at
                                 preventing future wars. I. The European Union formation, particularly as the European Economic Community, was a
                                 response to integrate and stabilize Europe post-World War II, though it evolved significantly later. J. The formation of military
                                 alliances, including NATO and the Warsaw Pact, was a reaction to the post-World War II Cold War and is a bit more indirect
                                 in this context. Considering the timing and direct reactions, the League of Nations and the United Nations were created
                                 specifically in response to World War I and World War II, respectively. Answer: G

                                 identify the nature of the conflicts shown in the images and link the correct option as a direct reaction to these conflicts:1.
                                 Image 1: "VICTORY BONDS WILL HELP STOP THIS. KULTUR VS. HUMANITY," Canada, 1918. This poster is from World

                                 JOIN A CAR-SHARING CLUB TODAY!" United States, early 1940s. This poster is from World War II, encouraging
                                 carpooling to save fuel for the war effort. Given these are related to the World Wars, the responses must relate directly to the
                                 aftermath or results of these wars. World War I led to the creation of the League of Nations to promote international
                                 cooperation and achieve peace. Therefore, the correct option in this context is (H) "The establishment of the League of
                                 Nations.”. Answer: H
