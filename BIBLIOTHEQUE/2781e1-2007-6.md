# Towards an executive without a homunculus: computational models of the prefrontal cortex/basal ganglia system (2007)
Source: 2781e1-2007.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper presents a computational model of the prefrontal cortex/basal ganglia system to explain executive function and working memory, which is a neuroscience focus rather than an ML architecture or dataset.
- The evidence emphasizes biological mechanisms (basal ganglia, dopamine, working memory) and computational modeling as cross-disciplinary context.

## Evidence extracts
- "In our model, the BG modulate working memory representations in prefrontal areas to support more abstract executive functions." (p. 1)
- "Keywords: basal ganglia; prefrontal cortex; dopamine; working memory; Pavlovian conditioning; computational modeling" (p. 1)
