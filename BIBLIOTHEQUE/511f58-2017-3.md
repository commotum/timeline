# Lie-Access Neural Turing Machines (2017)
Source: 511f58-2017.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a new external memory access mechanism (Lie-access memory) to address a missing capability: relative indexing structure in existing neural memory systems.
- Introduces a computation mechanism where memory access is driven by a continuous head moved by Lie group actions, implemented in a neural Turing machine variant.

## Evidence extracts
- "we ar gue that these neural memory systems lack speci002c structure important for relati v e inde xing, and propose an alternati v e model, Lie- access memory , that is e xplicitly designed for the neural setting." (p. 1)
- "we implement a neural T uring machine with an LSTM con- troller and se v eral v ersions of Lie-access memory , which we call Lie-access neural T uring machines 050LANTM051." (p. 2)
