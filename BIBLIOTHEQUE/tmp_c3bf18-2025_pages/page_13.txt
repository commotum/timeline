followed by multiple refinement iterations. In Sudoku, the strategy resembles a depth-first search
approach, where the model appears to explore potential solutions and backtracks when it hits dead
ends. HRM uses a different approach for ARC tasks, making incremental adjustments to the board
and iteratively improving it until reaching a solution. Unlike Sudoku, which involves frequent
backtracking, the ARC solution path follows a more consistent progression similar to hill-climbing
optimization.

Importantly, the model shows that it can adapt to different reasoning approaches, likely choosing an
effective strategy for each particular task. Further research is needed to gain more comprehensive
insights into these solution strategies.

4 Brain Correspondence

Akey principle from systems neuroscience is that a brain region’s functional repertoire—its ability
to handle diverse and complex tasks—is closely linked to the dimensionality of its neural represen-
tations’>"°, Higher-order cortical areas, responsible for complex reasoning and decision-making,
must handle a wide variety of tasks, demanding more flexible and context-dependent processing”.
In dynamical systems, this flexibility is often realized through higher-dimensional state-space tra-
jectories, which allow for a richer repertoire of potential computations ’*. This principle gives rise
to an observable dimensionality hierarchy, where a region’s position in the processing hierarchy
