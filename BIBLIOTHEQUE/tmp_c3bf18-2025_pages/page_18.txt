require CoT as a compensatory mechanism. Notably, linear attention can operate with a reduced
key-value cache over extended contexts, making them more suitable for deployment on resource-
constrained edge devices.

7 Conclusion

This work introduces the Hierarchical Reasoning Model, a brain-inspired architecture that lever-
ages hierarchical structure and multi-timescale processing to achieve substantial computational
depth without sacrificing training stability or efficiency. With only 27M parameters and train-
ing on just 1000 examples, HRM effectively solves challenging reasoning problems such as ARC,
Sudoku, and complex maze navigation—tasks that typically pose significant difficulties for contem-
porary LLM and chain-of-thought models.

Although the brain relies heavily on hierarchical structures to enable most cognitive processes,
these concepts have largely remained confined to academic literature rather than being translated
into practical applications. The prevailing AI approach continues to favor non-hierarchical models.
Our results challenge this established paradigm and suggest that the Hierarchical Reasoning Model
represents a viable alternative to the currently dominant chain-of-thought reasoning methods, ad-
vancing toward a foundational framework capable of Turing-complete universal computation.
