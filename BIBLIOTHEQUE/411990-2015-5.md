# Multi-Scale Context Aggregation by Dilated Convolutions (2016)
Source: 411990-2015.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a new convolutional network context module for dense prediction that aggregates multi-scale contextual information without losing resolution.
- The contribution is an architectural CNN mechanism (dilated context aggregation) rather than a dataset/benchmark or positional encoding approach.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this work, we develop a convolutional network module that aggregates multi-scale contextual
                            information without losing resolution or analyzing rescaled images." (p. 2)
- "The context module is designed to increase the performance of dense prediction architectures by
                            aggregating multi-scale contextual information." (p. 3)
