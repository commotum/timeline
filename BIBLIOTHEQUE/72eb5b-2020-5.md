# Just-in-Time Learning for Bottom-Up Enumerative Synthesis (2020)
Source: 72eb5b-2020.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper's main contribution is a just-in-time learning approach that bootstraps program-synthesis guidance from partial solutions during synthesis.
- It introduces guided bottom-up search as a new synthesis algorithm, framing the work as an algorithmic/learning-method contribution.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this work we introduce an alternative approach to guided program synthesis:
        instead of training a model ahead of time we show how to bootstrap one just in time, during synthesis, by
        learning from partial solutions encountered along the way." (p. 1)
- "To overcome this difoculty, we propose guided bottom-up search, a new synthesis algorithm" (p. 3)
