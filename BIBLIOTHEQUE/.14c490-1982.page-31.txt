Figure 18.19 The striate projection zone within the intraparietal sulcus. This zone is lo-
cated in the depth of the most caudal portion of the sulcus. Its approximate A-P level is
indicated by the vertical line on the lateral view of the hemisphere, and its depth by the
black square on the cross-section. The dark-field photomicrograph shows the locus of
degeneration after a medial striate lesion. Projections are seen in this very same region
from all parts of striate cortex, which suggests the absence of a visuotopic organization
within this projection zone. Source: Ungerleider and Mishkin 1979a.

al. 1977), so can ‘peripheral’ prestriate cortex substitute for “central”
prestriate cortex in this function. And if this is the case for the visual
recognition functions of inferior temporal cortex, where inputs from
peripheral vision are less important than those from central vision, then
the same must surely be true for the visual spatial functions of posterior
parietal cortex, where inputs from peripheral vision are equal in im-
portance to those from central vision (see figure 18.8).

Now that the total system of striate efferents has been delineated, the
effects of completely disconnecting temporal or parietal from striate
cortex can finally be investigated. Such disconnection should be
achievable by removal of just the three striate projection fields that have
been described, without inclusion of any other prestriate tissue. In ad-
dition, with special testing methods it may now be possible to study the
behavioral effects of prestriate-cortex damage without producing total
