# A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets (2006)
Source: 24bce2-2006.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a fast, greedy layer-wise learning algorithm for deep belief networks, which is a methodological contribution to how deep generative models are trained.
- The paper centers on learning procedures for DBNs rather than positional encoding, transformer dimensionality, or dataset/benchmark creation.

## Evidence extracts
- "Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time," (p. 1)
