# LogiQA 2.0 — An Improved Dataset for Logical Reasoning in Natural Language Understanding (2023)
Source: 920b99-2023.pdf

## Core reasons
- LogiQA 2.0 is presented as an amended, professionally translated, and culturally filtered logical reasoning corpus whose revisions include a first large-scale NLI conversion, positioning the work squarely as a dataset/resource contribution.
- The authors describe a four-fold dataset enhancement plan (larger size, high-quality translation, added NLI pairs, and fine-grained reasoning-type analysis) that establishes LogiQA 2.0 as a benchmark for measuring logical reasoning in NLP.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, we release LogiQA 2.0. The dataset is an amendment and re-annotation of LogiQA in 2020, a large-scale logical reasoning reading comprehension dataset adapted from the Chinese Civil Service Examination. We increase the data size, refine the texts with manual translation by professionals, and improve the quality by removing items with distinctive cultural features like Chinese idioms. Furthermore, we conduct a fine-grained annotation on the dataset and turn it into a two-way natural language inference (NLI) task, resulting in 35k premise-hypothesis pairs with gold labels, making it the first large-scale NLI dataset for complex logical reasoning." (p. 1)
- "First, we enlarged the dataset from 8678 instances to 15708 instances by collecting more logical test materials. Second, as shown in Figure 4(b), the quality of the English data is largely improved with fully professional human translation. Third, an NLI dataset is further added by making adaptations to the original MRC instances. Fourth, we give a fine-grained analysis of different logical reasoning types according to the division of logical reasoning types." (p. 4)
