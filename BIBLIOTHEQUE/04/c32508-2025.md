# A Comprehensive Behavioral Dataset for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (2025)
Source: c32508-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces H-ARC as a large-scale human behavioral dataset for ARC tasks, making the primary contribution a dataset resource.
- Positions H-ARC as a public benchmark for estimating human performance and comparing AI algorithms on ARC.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, we present H-aRC (Human-aRC): a novel large-scale dataset containing solution attempts from over 1700 humans on ARC problems. The dataset spans the full set of 400 training and 400 evaluation tasks from the original ARC benchmark, and it is the largest human evaluation to date." (p. 1)
- "H-ARC is a publicly available repository of over 15,500 attempts on ARC tasks, with step-by-step action traces recorded from our user-interface and accompanying natural-language solution descriptions (see Table 1)." (p. 2)
