# Unified Hallucination Detection for Multimodal Large Language Models (2024)
Source: a78209-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces MHaluBench as a meta-evaluation benchmark for multimodal hallucination detection across tasks and categories.
- The benchmark is explicitly designed to gauge progress of hallucination detectors (evaluation/measurement focus).

## Evidence extracts
- "We unveil MHaluBench, a meta-evaluation
  benchmark that encompasses various halluci-
  nation categories and multimodal tasks. This
  benchmark is equipped with fine-grained analyt-
  ical features, gauging the progress of hallucina-
  tion detectors." (p. 2)
- "Tofacilitate research in this area, we introduce the
  meta-evaluation benchmark MHaluBench, which
  encompasses the content from image-to-text and
  text-to-image generation, aiming to rigorously as-
  sess the advancements in multimodal hallucina-
  tion detectors." (p. 3)
