                 in practice than was the case for sophistication.
                     Asecond objection to logical depth is that even short, fast programs can be extremely “compli-
                 cated” in their behavior (as evidenced, for example, by cellular automata such as Conway’s Game
                 of Life).   Generating what many people would regard as a visually complex pattern—and what
                 we would regard as a complex, milk-tendril-ﬁlled state, in the coﬀee-cup system—simply need not
                 take a long time!     For this reason, one might be uneasy with the use of running time as a proxy
                 for complexity.
                 2.4     Light-Cone Complexity
                 The ﬁnal complexity measure we consider was proposed by Shalizi, Shalizi, and Haslinger [12];
                 we call it light-cone complexity.     In contrast to the previous measures, light-cone complexity does
                 not even try to deﬁne the “complexity” of a string x, given only x itself.            Instead, the deﬁnition
                 of light-cone complexity assumes a causal structure: that is, a collection of spacetime points A
                 (assumed to be ﬁxed), together with a transitive, cycle-free binary relation indicating which points
                 a ∈ A are to the “future” of which other points in A.            The set of all points b ∈ A to a’s future
                 is called a’s future light-cone, and is denoted F (a).       The set of all points b ∈ A to a’s past (that
                 is, such that a is to b’s future) is called a’s past light-cone, and is denoted P (a).        For example, if
                 we were studying the evolution of a 1-dimensional cellular automaton, then A would consist of all
                 ordered pairs (x,t) (where x is position and t is time), and we would have
                                                F(x,t) = {(y,u) : u > t,      |x −y| ≤ u−t},                                (4)
                                                P(x,t) = {(y,u) : u < t,      |x −y| ≤ t−u}.                                (5)
                     Nowgiven a spacetime point a ∈ A, let Va be the actual value assumed by the ﬁnite automaton
                 at a (for example, “alive” or “dead,” were we discussing Conway’s Game of Life or some other
                 2-state system).     In general, the ﬁnite automaton might be probabilistic, in which case Va is a
                 random variable, with a Shannon entropy H (Va) and so forth.                 Also, given a set S ⊆ A, let
                 VS := (Va)        be a complete description of the values at all points in S.           Then the light-cone
                              a∈S
                 complexity at a point a ∈ A, or LCC(a), can be deﬁned as follows:
                                           LCC(a)=IVP(a) : VF(a)                                                          (6)
                                                     =HV        +HV         −HV         , V    .                      (7)
                                                             P(a)          F(a)          P(a)   F(a)
                 In other words, LCC(a) is the mutual information between a’s past and future light-cones: the
                 number of bits about a’s future that are encoded by its past. If we want the light-cone complexity
                 of (say) an entire spatial slice, we could then take the sum of LCC(a) over all a in that slice, or
                 some other combination.
                     The intuition here is that, if the cellular automaton dynamics are “too simple,” then LCC(a)
                 will be small simply because H VP(a) and H VF(a) are both small. Conversely, if the dynamics
                 are “too random,” then LCC(a) will be small because H VP(a),VF(a) ≈ H VP(a) + H VF(a):
                 although the past and future light-cones both have plenty of entropy, they are uncorrelated, so
                 that knowledge of the past is of barely any use in predicting the future. Only in an intermediate
                 regime, where there are interesting non-random dynamics, should there be substantial uncertainty
                 about VF(a) that can be reduced by knowing VP(a).
                     AsShalizi et al. [12] point out, a major advantage of light-cone complexity, compared to sophis-
                 tication, logical depth, and so on, is that light-cone complexity has a clear “operational meaning”:
                                                                        7
