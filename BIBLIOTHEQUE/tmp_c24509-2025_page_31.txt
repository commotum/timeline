              10 PotentialSocietalImpact&Limitations
              In this section, we elaborate on the potential positive and negative societal impact of this work, as well as the
              broader impact and some potential limitations.
              10.1  SocietalImpact
              Our approach’s ability to generate high-quality 4D occupancy holds the potential to significantly impact
              various domains, particularly autonomous driving, robotics, urban planning, and smart city development.
              By creating realistic, large-scale, dynamic scenes, our model can aid in developing more robust and safe
              autonomous systems. These systems can be better trained and evaluated against diverse scenarios, including
              rare but critical edge cases like unexpected pedestrian movements or complex trafÏc patterns, which are
              difÏcult to capture in real-world datasets. This contribution can lead to safer autonomous vehicles, reducing
              trafÏc accidents, and improving trafÏc efÏciency, ultimately benefiting society by enhancing transportation
              systems.
              In addition to autonomous driving, DynamicCity can be valuable for developing virtual reality (VR) environ-
              ments and augmented reality (AR) applications, enabling more realistic 3D simulations that could be used in
              various industries, including entertainment, training, and education. These advancements could help improve
              skill development in driving schools, emergency response training, and urban planning scenarios, fostering a
              safer and more informed society.
              Despite these positive outcomes, the technology could be misused. The ability to generate realistic dynamic
              scenes might be exploited to create misleading or fake data, potentially undermining trust in autonomous
              systems or spreading misinformation about the capabilities of such technologies. However, we do not foresee
              any direct harmful impact from the intended use of this work, and ethical guidelines and responsible practices
              can mitigate potential risks.
              10.2 BroaderImpact
              Our approach’s contribution to 4D scene generation stands to advance the fields of autonomous driving,
              robotics, and even urban planning. By providing a scalable solution for generating diverse and dynamic scenes,
              it enables researchers and engineers to develop more sophisticated models capable of handling real-world
              complexity. This has the potential to accelerate progress in autonomous systems, making them safer, more
              reliable, and adaptable to a wide range of environments. For example, researchers can use DynamicCity to
              generate synthetic training data, supplementing real-world data, which is often expensive and time-consuming
              to collect, especially in dynamic and high-risk scenarios.
              The broader impact also extends to lowering entry barriers for smaller research institutions and startups that
              may not have access to vast amounts of real-world occupancy data. By offering a means to generate realistic
              and dynamic scenes, DynamicCity democratizes access to high-quality data for training and validating machine
              learning models, thereby fostering innovation across the autonomous driving and robotics communities.
              However, it is crucial to emphasize that synthetic data should be used responsibly. As our model generates
              highly realistic scenes, there is a risk that reliance on synthetic data could lead to models that fail to generalize
              effectively in real-world settings, especially if the generated scenes do not capture the full diversity or rare
              conditions found in real environments. Hence, it is important to complement synthetic data with real-world
              data and ensure transparency when using synthetic data in model training and evaluation.
              10.3 KnownLimitations
              Despite the strengths of DynamicCity, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, our model’s ability
              to generate extremely long sequences is still constrained by computational resources, leading to potential
              challenges in accurately modeling scenarios that span extensive periods. While we employ techniques to
              extend temporal modeling, there may be degradation in scene quality or consistency when attempting to
              generate sequences beyond a certain length, particularly in complex trafÏc scenarios.
