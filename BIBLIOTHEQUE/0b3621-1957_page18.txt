been saturated to a given level -- i.e., after some number of associations
has been learned by the system. This probability is formally equivalent
to the probability of establishing a correct discrimination between any
two A-sets on the basis of their mean values, ad will be called P,. The

d
results of some calculations of Pa are presented in Table 1, This table

shows the probability of a correct preference for one of two responses,
in a system which has learned N, associations to each response. The table

has been computed by equation 5, in Appendix I and is subject to the

conditions indicated there, Ny is the number of A-units connected to

each R-unit. The entries in the table represent the normal curve ordinates
of the probability, Pas rather than the probabilities themselves. Thus
with 1000 A-units connected to each R-unit, and a system in which 1% of

the Aeunits respond to stimuli of a given size (iceo, P= o01), the prob-

a
ability of making a correct discrimination with one mit of training, after

10° stimuli have been associated to each response in the system, is equal

to the 2.23 sigma level, or a probability of 0.987 of being correct. In
the table, the communality between A-sets for different responses has been
taken to be zero, i.e., each A-unit transmits to one and only one response
unit. To correct for varying degrees of communality (Po) between the
sets connected to different responses, the figures presented should be
multiplied by 1-Pons and Ny should be divided by the expected number of
output connections per Aeunit. The advantage of overlapping the Resets
(in the manner indicated in Fig, 3) is similar to the advantage of over-
lapping the A-sets for different stimuli; it permits a vast increase in
the number of alternative responses which can be handled, at the cost of
a relatively unimportant degradation in the probability of a correct
response,

From Table 1, the potential efficiency of a system of this
sort can readily be seen. By overlapping the A-sets for different
responses (ices, permitting Por to be greater than zero) a great number

of mutually exclusive responses can be included in any one set, and by
