BASIC PERCEPTRON EQUATIONS

1. Proportion of Association Units Responding to a Stimulus (Po):

For a finite number of S-points,

PR, = 2,), Pi) (1)

where. Max (r-y -2;9) <=
max (0, r-X-Bg)s

P(e,i) = ee eli gon

@é< min(r,x)
i < min(e-9,r-e)

nor
n = total number of S-points in system
r = number of S-points activated by the stimulus
x = number of +1's in a colum of the SyA connection matrix
y = number of -1's in a column of the connection matrix
2 = number of zeros in a column of the connection matrix
h = r-e~i = number of zeros in a column of a matrix of r
rows, obtained by striking out n-r rows from
the S,A matrix, where e = number of +1's and
i = number of ~L1's,,
@ = threshold of an A=-umit

When the number of S=points is large, the solution of this
equation converges rapidly to the equation for an infinite number of

S=points:
