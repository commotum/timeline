II. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF A PHOTOPERCEPTRON

We might consider the perceptron as a black box, with
a TV camera for input, and an alphabetic printer or a set of signal
lights as output. Its performance can then be described as a process
of learning to give the same output signal (or print the same word)
for all optical stimuli which belong to some arbitrarily constituted
class, Such a class might be the set of all two-dimensional trans-
positions of a triangle over the field of view of the TV camera, or
the set of rotational positions of a 3-dimensional form. The forms of
a stimulus pattern which are to be identified as equivalent can each
be represented as a unique set of illuminated points in the TV raster,
All of the "equivalent" forms constitute a transposition set, which we
will call T.

It is possible to teach the system to discriminate two
such generalized forms, or "percepts", by presenting for each form a
random sample from the set of its possible transformations, while
simultaneously "forcing" the system to respond with Output 1 for Form 1,
and Output 2 for Form 2. For example, we might require the perceptron
to learn the concepts "square" and "circle", and to turn on Signal
Light 1 for "square", and Signal Light 2 for "circle", We would then
proceed to show the system a large set of squares of different sizes,
in different locations, while holding Light No. 1 on, thus "forcing"
the response. We would then show a similar set of circles, while
holding Light No. 2 on. If we then show the perceptron any square or
any circle, we would expect it to turn on the appropriate light, with
a high probability of being correct. The penalty that we pay for the
use of statistical principles in the design of the system is a probabi-
lity that we may get a wrong response in any particular case <= i.e.,

a wrong response that is inherent in the nature of the system, rather
