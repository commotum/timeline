# Accelerating Search-Based Program Synthesis using Learned Probabilistic Models (2018)
Source: 517a35-2018.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper focuses on accelerating search-based program synthesis by biasing the search toward likely programs with a weighted search approach, which is a methodological contribution rather than a transformer/positional encoding change.
- It proposes a transfer-learning-based method to learn a probabilistic higher order grammar model from known solutions, indicating an ML methodology contribution rather than a dataset/benchmark.
