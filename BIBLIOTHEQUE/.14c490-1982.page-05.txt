Figure 18.1 Striate-prestriate-temporal pathways. Abbreviations refer to cytoarchitec-
tonic divisions of von Bonin and Bailey (1947). Lower diagram indicates pathways re-
maining after crossed striate and inferior temporal lesions (in black). Pathways are shown
as two-way, in accord with the neuroanatomical evidence that the connections are recip-
rocal (Kuypers et al. 1965; Rockland and Pandya 1979). Adapted from Mishkin 1966.

matized in figure 18.1. As indicated in the upper diagram, each stri-
ate area transmits visual information, relayed through the prestriate
cortex, to the ipsilateral inferior temporal area; but, in addition, be-
cause of the reciprocal prestriate connections across the corpus
callosum, each striate area also transmits visual information to the con-
tralateral inferior temporal area. The behavioral significance of these
pathways was first demonstrated in a series of crossed-lesion discon-
nection experiments (Mishkin 1966). Since such disconnection studies
are not commonly employed to investigate brain-behavior relation-
ships, a brief explanation of the underlying logic may be in order.
The usual method of identifying the function of a cortical area is to
remove that same area from both hemispheres and then determine what
function has been lost. This method does not reveal whether the func-
tion was lost because it depended on the area (or station) that was
removed or because it depended on a later station along the same
pathway that could no longer operate after the pathway leading to it
was destroyed. Crossed-lesion disconnection studies make it possible
to demonstrate that a pathway with many cortical stations exists. The
method is to remove one of the stations in the postulated pathway on
one side of the brain, and to remove a different one (later in the path-
way) on the other side (see lower diagram of figure 18.1). This leaves
