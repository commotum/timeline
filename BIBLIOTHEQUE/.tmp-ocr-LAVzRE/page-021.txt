TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 555

Fitting the Messages to the Lines

To facilitate this discussion it seems desirable to introduce and
explain a few terms. For transmitting a sequence of symbols various
sorts of media may be available, such as a wire line, an air path,
as in direct speech, or the ether, as in radio communication. For
convenience we shall group all of these under the general name of
“line.” Each such medium is generally characterized by a range of
frequencies over which transmission may be carried on with reasonable
freedom from distortion and external interference. This will be
called the ‘‘line-frequency-range.”’ Similarly the symbol sequences
corresponding to the various modes of communication such as telegraph
and telephone, will be designated as “messages.” Each of these will,
in general, be characterized by a ‘‘message frequency-range.”” This
may be thought of as being determined by the frequency-range of
that line which will just transmit the type of message satisfactorily,
or we may think of it as that part of the frequency scale within which
it is necessary to preserve the steady state components of the message
wave in order to permit distinguishing the various symbols as they
appear in the transmitted wave.

When we set up practical communication systems it is often found
that the message-frequency-range and the line-frequency-range do
not coincide either in magnitude or in position on the frequency scale.
If then we are to make use of the full transmission capacity of the line,
or lines, we must introduce means for altering the frequency-ranges
required by the messages. Two such means are available, which
together offer the theoretical possibility of accomplishing the desired
end of making the message-frequency-ranges fit the available line-
frequency-ranges.

The process of modulation so widely used in radio systems and in
carrier transmission over wires makes it possible to shift the frequency-
range of any message to a new location on the frequency scale without
altering the width of the range. This follows at once from the well-
known fact that the steady state description of the wave which
results from the modulation of a carrier wave by a symbol wave
includes a pair of side-bands in each of which there is a component
corresponding to each steady state component of the original wave.
The frequency of each component of the side-band differs from the
carrier frequency by the frequency of the corresponding component
of the symbol wave. The elimination of one of these side-bands
results in a wave which retains the information embodied in the
original symbol wave and occupies a frequency-range of the same width
