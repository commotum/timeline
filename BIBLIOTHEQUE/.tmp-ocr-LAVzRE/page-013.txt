If we sum this expression for all values of g from one to infinity, we
get the combined effect of all the preceding symbols, that is, the
intersymbol interference. Calling this 7;,

This obviously increases as the interval + between selections is de-
creased. If this interval is made small enough, the intersymbol
interference may cause confusion between symbols. Since the inter-
ference is here always of one sign it can cause confusion only when it
becomes as large as the minimum difference, 7,, between symbols.
Placing these two quantities equal, we get from (12) and (17) as the
minimum permissible value of r,

r, = 8S. (18)

Here the numerator is, in accordance with our measure of information,
the amount of information contained in 2 selections, so the left-hand
member is the information per unit time or the rate of communication.
This is equal to the damping constant of the circuit. We therefore
conclude that for this particular case the possible rate of communica-
tion is fixed solely by the damping constant of the circuit and is
independent of the number of symbols available at each selection.
It is, of course, true that the larger this number the more susceptible
will the system be to the effects of external interference.

Probably the practical system which most nearly approaches this
idealized one is the non-loaded submarine telegraph cable when
operated at such low speeds that its inductance may be neglected.
It is of considerable historical interest to note that Lord Kelvin's
