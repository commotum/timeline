to. A trained operator, however, would say that the sequence sent
out by the automatic device was not intelligible. The reason for
this is that only a limited number of the possible sequences have been
assigned meanings common to him and the sending operator. Thus
the number of symbols available to the sending operator at certain
of his selections is here limited by psychological rather than physical
considerations. Other operators using other codes might make other
selections. Hence in estimating the capacity of the physical system
to transmit information we should ignore the question of interpretation,
make each selection perfectly arbitrary, and base our result on the
possibility of the receiver’s distinguishing the result of selecting any
one symbol from that of selecting any other. By this means the
psychological factors and their variations are eliminated and it becomes
possible to set up a definite quantitative measure of information
based on physical considerations alone.

Quantitative Expression for Information

At each selection there are available three possible symbols. Two
successive selections make possible 32, or 9, different permutations or
symbol sequences. Similarly » selections make possible 3” different
sequences. Suppose that instead of this system, in which three
current values are used, one is provided in which any arbitrary number
s of different current values can be applied to the line and distinguished
from each other at the receiving end. Then the number of symbols
available at each selection is s and the number of distinguishable
sequences is 5”.

Consider the case of a printing telegraph system of the Baudot
type, in which the operator selects letters or other characters each of
which when transmitted consists of a sequence of symbols (usually
five in number). We may think of the various current values as
primary symbols and the various sequences of these which represent
characters as secondary symbols. The selection may then be made
at the sending end among either primary or secondary symbols.
Let the operator select a sequence of #2 characters each made up of
a sequence of #, primary selections. At each selection he will have
available as many different secondary symbols as there are different
sequences that can result from making selections from among the
§ primary symbols. If we call this number of secondary symbols se,

then
Sy = 5M, (1)
For the Baudot System

$y = 25 = 32 characters. (2)
