TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 561

horizontal dimension is increased and the vertical dimension left
unchanged. Let the scanning strips run in a horizontal direction.
If we consider the magnitude-distance function representing the
variation along any horizontal strip, the effect of the enlargement is
to increase the wave-length of each steady state component in the
ratio of the increase in linear dimension. The wave number of each
component is therefore decreased in this ratio, and so the wave-
number-range is also decreased in the same ratio. The product of
the wave-number-range by the length of the strip remains constant,
as does also the sum of the products for all of the strips, that is, for
the entire picture. The second step consists in increasing the vertical
dimensions with the horizontal dimensions fixed. By considering the
scanning strips as running vertically in this case it follows at once
that the product of wave-number-range by distance remains constant
during this operation also.

Since the information transmitted is measured by the product of
frequency-range by time when it is in electrical form and by the
product of wave-number-range by distance when it is in graphic form,
we should expect that when a record such as a picture or phonographic
record is converted into an electric current, or vice versa, the corre-
sponding products for the two should be equal regardless of the velocity
of reproduction. That this is true may be easily shown. Let v be
the velocity with which the recorder or reproducer is moved relative
to the record. Let the wave-number-range of the record extend
between the limits w; and we. If we consider any one component of
the distance function which has a wave-length A, the time required
for the reproducer to traverse a complete cycle is d/v, or 1/ew. This
is the period of the resulting component of the time wave, so the
frequency f of the latter is the reciprocal of this, or vw. The fre-
quency-range is therefore given by

fo — fr = v(we — wi). (24)

If D is the length of the record, then the time required to reproduce
it is

r=2, (25)
from which
(fo —fi)T = (ws — wi)D. (26)

This shows that the two products are numerically equal regardless
of the velocity.
