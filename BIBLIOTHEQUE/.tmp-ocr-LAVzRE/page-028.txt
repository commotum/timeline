A pplication to Television

As our first illustration was drawn from one of the earliest forms
of electrical communication, the submarine cable, it may be fitting
to use as the last what is probably the newest form, namely, television.
Here the information to be transmitted exists originally in the form
of a magnitude which is a continuous function of both space and time.
In order to determine what line facilities are needed to maintain a
constant view of the distant scene we wish to determine the line-
frequency-range required. This we know to be measured by the
total information to be transmitted per unit time.

In the systems of television which have been most successful the
method has been similar to that of the motion picture in that a suc-
cession of separate representations of the scene is placed before the
observer and the persistence of vision is relied upon to convert the
intermittent illumination into an apparently continuous variation
with time. The first step in determining the required frequency-
range is to determine the information content of a single one of the
successive views of the scene. This may be determined exactly as
for a still picture. The required degree of resolution into elementary
areas and the required accuracy of reproduction of the intensity within
each area determine an effective number of selections and a number
of primary symbols available at each selection. These determine
a minimum product of wave-number-range by distance. This in
turn is equal to the product of line-frequency-range by time which
must be available for the transmission of a single view of the scene.
The time available is set by the fact that flicker becomes objectionable
if the interval between successive pictures exceeds about one sixteenth
of a second. Thus we have only to divide the product of wave-
number-range by distance for a single picture by one sixteenth to
obtain the line-frequency-range necessary to maintain a continuous
view.

In the result just obtained an important factor is the interval
necessary to prevent flicker. The tendency to flicker is, however,
the result of the particular method of transmission. If it were practical
to eliminate this factor, the required frequency-range might be some-
what different. We might, for example, imagine a system more like
that of direct vision in which the magnitude-time function representing
the intensity variation of each individual elementary area is trans-
mitted over an independent line and used to produce a continuously
varying illumination of the corresponding area of the reproduced
scene. The frequency-range required on any one of these individual
