TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 551

medium. Other forms of energy storage give to the admittance-
frequency curves shapes which are characteristic of the particular
system. This alteration of these curves is commonly spoken of as
frequency distortion. Their form may in most cases be deduced
fairly readily from the values of the energy-storing and energy-dissi-
pating elements of the system. This fact makes such a description
of the system particularly useful for design purposes.

This physical description is, of course, useful as a criterion of
performance only in so far as it can be related to the satisfactoriness
with which the system performs its primary function of transmitting
information. In the case of telephony it has been found practical
to establish such a correlation by purely empirical means. Until
fairly recently adequate results have been obtained by considering
the amplitude-frequency function only. With the use of lines of
increasing length and with increasingly severe standards of performance
it is coming to be necessary to take account of the phase-frequency
function as well.

In attempting to extend this method of treatment to telegraphy it
was not found desirable to establish the correlation between steady
state properties and overall performance by purely empirical methods.
One reason for this was that a considerable fund of information has
been accumulated with reference to the correlation between the
overall performance and the transient properties of the system. A
correlation therefore between steady state and transient properties
would offer a means of bringing this empirical information to bear on
the design of apparatus and systems on a steady state basis. For
bridging this gap between steady state and transient phenomena
there was already available one arch in the form of the Fourier Integral.
This integral may be thought of as a mathematical fiction for expressing
a transient phenomenon in terms of steady state phenomena. It
permits the determination, for any magnitude-time function, of the
relative amplitudes and the phases of an infinite succession of sustained
sinusoids whose resultant is at any instant equal to the magnitude of
the function at that instant. The amplitudes of the sinusoids are
infinitesimal and the frequencies of successive components differ from
each other by infinitesimal increments. The relative amplitudes and
the phases of these components expressed as functions of the frequency
constitute a steady state description of the magnitude-time function.

Suppose then we have given the magnitude-time function repre-
senting an impressed transient driving force and wish to obtain the
magnitude-time function of the received current. We deduce the

steady state description of the driving force, modify the amplitudes
