study of such cables led him to the conclusion that the extent to which
the cable limited the dotting speed was given by KR, that is, the
product of the total capacity and total resistance. Had he stated
his results in terms of permissible speed he would have had the re-
ciprocal of this quantity, which corresponds very closely to the
damping constant which we arrived at as a measure of the rate of
communication. It should be noted, however, that his consideration
was limited to a fixed number of symbols, and did not involve the
relation here developed between this number and the dotting speed.

The more complicated systems are similar to the simple case just
treated in that the contribution of any one symbol, a, to the inter-
ference with any other symbol, 6, is determined by the free vibration
of the system which results from the change applied to it in the
production of symbol a. This free vibration, instead of being expres-
sible by a single exponential function as in the case just considered,
may be the resultant of a large number of more or less damped oscil-
latory components corresponding to the various natural modes of
the system. The total interference with any one symbol is the
resultant of a series of these complex vibrations, one for each inter-
fering symbol. The instantaneous values of the various components
of the interference are so dependent upon their phases at the particular
instant of observation that it is difficult to draw any general conclusions
as to the magnitude of the total interference. It is equally difficult
therefore to draw any general conclusions as to the relation between
the rate of transmission over a particular circuit and the number of
available symbols.

Relation to Storage of Energy

Even though for any one system there exists a number of available
symbols for which the rate of communication is greater than for any
other number, it is still possible to make a generalization with respect
to the storage of energy in the system and its effect on the rate of
transmission which is of considerable practical importance.

Each of the natural modes of vibration of a linear system has the

general form
t = Ae cos (wt — 4), (21)

where the natural frequency w and damping constant a are character-
istic of the system and the amplitude A and phase @ depend on the
conditions of excitation. Wherever the time appears in this expression
it is multiplied by either the damping constant @ or the frequency w.
Consequently if both @ and w be changed, say in the ratio k, the
instantaneous value of this mode of vibration in the new system will
