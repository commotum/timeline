The intersymbol interference will consist of currents resulting from
all of the preceding symbols. The contribution of any one symbol
will depend on its size, that is, on the number of added cells it represents,
and on how long it preceded the symbol in question. For a given
rate of selection the resultant of these contributions will be a maximum
for that particular sequence of symbols for which at every selection
preceding the one in question the operator had selected the largest

of the received current is then as shown on Fig. 4, where A represents
the disturbed symbol. The curves are drawn for s equal to five.
The current resulting from one such change occurring at time zero is

If the interval between selections is 7, then the time during which
any one interfering current is damped out before it makes its con-
tribution to the interference with the disturbed symbol is gr where g
is the number of selections by which it precedes the disturbed symbol.
The magnitude of its contribution is therefore from (13)
