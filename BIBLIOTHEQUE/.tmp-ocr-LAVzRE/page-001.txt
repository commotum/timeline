Transmission of Information’

By R. V. L. HARTLEY

Synopsis: A quantitative measure of ‘information”’ is developed which
is based on physical as contrasted with psychological considerations. How
the rate of transmission of this information over a system is limited by the
distortion resulting from storage of energy is discussed from the transient
viewpoint. The relation between the transient and steady state viewpoints
is reviewed. It is shown that when the storage of energy is used to restrict
the steady state transmission to a limited range of frequencies the amount
of information that can be transmitted is proportional to the product of
the width of the frequency-range by the time it is available. Several
illustrations of the application of this principle to practical systems are
included, In the case of picture transmission and television the spacial
variation of intensity is analyzed by a steady state method analogous to
that commonly used for variations with time.

HILE the frequency relations involved in electrical communi-
cation are interesting in themselves, I should hardly be justified
in discussing them on this occasion unless we could deduce from them
something of fairly general practical application to the engineering
of communication systems. What I hope to accomplish in this
direction is to set up a quantitative measure whereby the capacities of
various systems to transmit information may be compared. In doing
this I shall discuss its application to systems of telegraphy, telephony,
picture transmission and television over both wire and radio paths.
It will, of course, be found that in very many cases it is not economi-
cally practical to make use of the full physical possibilities of a system.
Such a criterion is, however, often useful for estimating the possible
increase in performance which may be expected to result from im-
provements in apparatus or circuits, and also for detecting fallacies
in the theory of operation of a proposed system.

Inasmuch as the results to be obtained are to represent the limits
of what may be expected under rather idealized conditions, it will be
permissible to simplify the discussion by neglecting certain factors
which, while often important in practice, have the effect only of
causing the performance to fall somewhat further short of the ideal.
For example, external interference, which can never be entirely
eliminated in practice, always reduces the effectiveness of the system.
We may, however, arbitrarily assume it to be absent, and consider
the limitations which still remain due to the transmission system itself.

In order to lay the groundwork for the more practical applications
of these frequency relationships, it will first be necessary to discuss a
few somewhat abstract considerations.
