TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 537

sending operator has at his disposal three positions of a sending key
which correspond to applied voltages of the two polarities and to no
applied voltage. In making a selection he decides to direct attention
to one of the three voltage conditions or symbols by throwing the key to
the position corresponding to that symbol. The disturbance trans-
mitted over the cable is then the result of a series of conscious selec-
tions. However, a similar sequence of arbitrarily chosen symbols
might have been sent by an automatic mechanism which controlled
the position of the key in accordance with the results of a series of
chance operations such as a ball rolling into one of three pockets.

Owing to the distortion of the cable the results of the various
selections as exhibited to the receiver by the recorder trace are not
as clearly distinguishable as they were in the positions of the sending
key. Fig. 1 shows at A the sequence of key positions, and at B,
C and D the traces made by the recorder when receiving over an
artificial cable of progressively increasing length. For the shortest
cable B the reconstruction of the original sequence is a simple matter.
For the intermediate length C, however, more care is needed to dis-
tinguish just which key position a particular part of the record repre-
sents. In D the symbols have become hopelessly indistinguishable.
The capacity of a system to transmit a particular sequence of symbols
depends upon the possibility of distinguishing at the receiving end
between the results of the various selections made at the sending end.
The operation of recognizing from the received record the sequence
of symbols selected at the sending end may be carried out by those
of us who are not familiar with the Morse code. We would do this
equally well for a sequence representing a consciously chosen message
and for one sent out by the automatic selecting device already referred
