tude-frequency curve of the system. Similarly we add to the phase-
frequency curve of the impressed wave, which is zero at all frequencies,
the phase-frequency curve of the system and obtain for the received
wave a phase-frequency curve identical with that of the system.
The corresponding magnitude-time function gives the instantaneous
value of the received current resulting from the impressed impulse.
Thus we see that the steady state transfer admittance of a system is
identical with the steady state description of the wave which is
received over the system when it is subjected to an impulsive driving
force. Once the form of this received wave is known the received
wave resulting from any applied wave may be deduced by assuming
the applied wave to consist of an infinite succession of impulses
infinitesimally close together whose magnitudes vary with time in
accordance with the given magnitude-time function. Methods for
integrating the effect of this infinite succession of responses to impulses
so as to obtain the transmitted wave have been developed.

From this review it is evident that the so-called frequency distortion
and transient distortion are merely two methods of describing the
same changes in wave form which result from the storage of energy
in parts of the transmission system.

SIGNIFICANCE OF PRODUCT OF FREQUENCY-RANGE BY TIME

Distortion of this sort with its accompanying intersymbol inter-
ference may be unavoidable in the design of the system, or it may be
deliberately introduced. The use of electrical filters to obtain multi-

plex operation, as in carrier systems, is an example of its deliberate use.
Consider the effect of introducing a low pass filter, as shown in Fig. 5,
into an otherwise distortionless transmission system. If the imped-
ances of the circuits to which the filter is connected are approximately
pure resistances of the values indicated in the figure, steady state
frequencies above a critical value known as the cut-off frequency
are so reduced as to be made practically negligible, while frequencies
below this value are transmitted with very little distortion. The
