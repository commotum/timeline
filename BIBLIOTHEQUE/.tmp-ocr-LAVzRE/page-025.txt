TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 559

the information content may be found exactly as it would be from
the pressure-time curve of the air vibration. Ina picture, on the other
hand, two dimensions are involved. We may, however, reduce this
to a single dimension by dividing the area into a succession of strips
of uniform width, as is done by the scanning aperture which is used
in the electrical transmission of pictures. Figure 6 shows this scanning
mechanism. The picture is mounted on a revolving cylinder which
at each revolution is advanced by a spiral screw by the width of the
desired strip. This scanning operation is equivalent to making an
arbitrary number of selections in a direction at right angles to the
strips. The number of these determines the degree of resolution in
that direction. If the resolution is to be the same in both directions,
we may consider the magnitude-distance function along the strip to
be made up of the same number of selections per unit length. The
total number of primary selections will then be equal to the number
of elementary squares into which the picture is thus divided. These
elementary areas differ from each other in their average intensity.
The number of different intensities which may be correctly distin-
guished from each other in each elementary area of the reproduced
picture represents the number of primary symbols available at each
selection. Hence the total information content of the picture is
given by the number of elementary areas times the logarithm of the
number of distinguishable intensities.

In an actual picture the intensity as a function of distance along
what we may call the line of scanning is a definite continuous function
of the distance, but if there is any blurring of the picture as reproduced
this function loses some of its definiteness. This blurring may be
thought of as a form of intersymbol interference, since the intensity
at one point in the distorted picture depends upon the original intensity
at neighboring points. The similarity of this type of distortion to
the intersymbol interference occurring in magnitude-time functions
as a result of energy storage suggests that the picture distortion may
also be treated on a steady state basis. We may think of the magni-
tude-distance function representing the picture as being analyzed
into sustained components in each of which the intensity is a sinusoidal
function of the distance. We may visualize such a single component
in terms of the mechanism employed for recording and reproducing
speech by means of a motion picture film. The intensity of the
light transmitted by the developed film varies along its length in
accordance with the magnitude of the electric wave resulting from
the speech sound. If the speech wave be replaced by a sustained
alternating current, there will result on the film a sinusoidal variation
