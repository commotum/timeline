We may, however, use it as the basis for a derived measure which
does meet the practical requirements. To do this we arbitrarily put
the amount of information proportional to the number of selections
and so choose the factor of proportionality as to make equal amounts
of information correspond to equal numbers of possible sequences.
For a particular system let the amount of information associated with

n selections be
H= Kn, (4)

where K is a constant which depends on the number s of symbols
available at each selection. Take any two systems for which s has
the values s; and s, and let the corresponding constants be Ky and Ko.
We then define these constants by the condition that whenever the
numbers of selections ; and 2 for the two systems are such that the
number of possible sequences is the same for both systems, then the
amount of information is also the same for both; that is to say, when

Sy = 52", (5)
A= Kym, = Kym, (6)

from which
A A (7)

log s ~ log 59 ,

This relation will hold for all values of s only if K is connected with s

by the relation
K= Kylogs, (8)

where Ky is the same for all systems. Since Kp is arbitrary, we may
omit it if we make the logarithmic base arbitrary. The particular
base selected fixes the size of the unit of information. Putting this

value of K in (4),
H = nlogs (9)

= log s". (10)

What we have done then is to take as our practical measure of infor-
mation the logarithm of the number of possible symbol sequences.

The situation is similar to that involved in measuring the trans-
mission loss due to the insertion of a piece of apparatus in a telephone
system. The effect of the insertion is to alter in a certain ratio the
power delivered to the receiver. This ratio might be taken as a meas-
ure of the loss. It is found more convenient, however, to take the
logarithm of the power ratio as a measure of the transmission loss.
