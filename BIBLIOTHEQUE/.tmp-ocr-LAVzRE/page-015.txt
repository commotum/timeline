be the same at a time ¢/k that it was at time / in the original system.
If the same change is made in the damping constant and frequency
of each one of the modes of free vibration, their resultant, or the wave
set up by any one symbol, will also be so changed that any particular
value occurs at time ¢/k instead of ¢. Suppose also that the interval
rt between selections be changed to 7/k. Then any two symbols
originally separated by a time 4 will be separated by 4/k. The
value of the interfering wave at the time #,/Rk when the disturbed
symbol occurs will be the same as it was at the corresponding time f,
when it occurred in the original system. Hence the contribution of
this wave to the intersymbol interference is unchanged. Since this
relation holds for all of the interfering symbols, the total intersymbol
interference remains unchanged, and so the number of possible symbols
that may be distinguished is unaltered. The rate of making selections
is changed in the ratio k, and hence the maximum rate of communica-
tion is changed in the same ratio as the damping constants and natural
frequencies,

Now let us consider what physical changes must be made in the
system to bring about the assumed changes in the damping constants
and natural frequencies of the various modes. ‘Take the simple case
of an inductance, capacity and resistance connected in series. Here
we have the well-known relations

1 R\?
If R remains fixed and LZ is changed to L/k, a becomes ka. If, in
addition, C is changed to C/k, w becomes kw. What we have done
is to leave the energy-dissipating element, R, unchanged and change
both the energy-storing elements, L and C, in the inverse ratio in
which the rate of communication is changed. For more complicated
systems the expressions for a and w are correspondingly complicated.
In every case, however, it will be found that if all of the dissipating
and storing elements are treated as in the simple case just considered
all of the damping constants and natural frequencies will be similarly
altered. Where mechanical systems are concerned we are to substitute
for electrical resistances their mechanical equivalents, and for induc-
tances and capacities, inertias and compliances. This generalization
that a proportionate change in all of the energy-storing elements of
the system with no accompanying change in the dissipating elements
