TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 557

Modulation may, of course, be necessary to bring the message-range
to the proper part of the frequency scale. The time required for the
reproduction of a message involving a given number of selections
varies inversely as the velocity of the tape in reproduction, and
therefore also inversely as the frequency-range required by the repro-
duced sequence. Thus the product of frequency-range by time for
the reproduced message, which is also the required product for the
line, is independent of the rate of reproduction, and depends only on
the information content of the message in its original form.

In case the available line range calls for reproduction at a consider-
ably increased speed a single operator cannot conveniently keep the
sending apparatus supplied with tape. Multiplex operation may
then be employed in which the line is used by the various operators
in rotation. It is interesting to note that this distributor type of
multiplex utilizes the frequency-range of the line as efficiently as would
a single printing telegraph channel using the same dotting speed,
and more efficiently than does the carrier multiplex method. By the
distributor method each operator utilizes the full frequency-range of
the line during the time allotted to him and there is no time wasted
in separating the channels from each other. In the carrier multiplex,
on the other hand, while each operator uses the line for the full time
it is available, a part of the frequency-range is wasted in separating
the channels because of the departure of physical filters from the ideal.
Also both side-bands are generally transmitted in telegraphy, in
which case a still greater line-frequency-range is required for the
carrier method.

If the message is produced originally as a continuous time function,
as in speech, the same method may be used by substituting for the
tape a phonographic record. That here also the required line-fre-
quency-range varies directly as the speed of reproduction and inversely
as the time of reproduction is obvious when we consider an imperfectly
defined wave as equivalent to a succession of finite steps or a perfectly
defined wave as a succession of infinitesimal steps. From the steady
state viewpoint, all of the component frequencies are altered in the
ratio of the reproducing and recording velocities, and hence the range
which they occupy is altered in the same ratio.

Thus we see that for all forms of communication which are carried
on by means of magnitude-time functions an upper limit to the amount
of information which may be transmitted is set by the sum for the
various available lines of the product of the line-frequency-range of
each by the time during which it is available for use.
