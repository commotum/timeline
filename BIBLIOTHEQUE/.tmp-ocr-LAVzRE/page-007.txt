TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 541

If we put # equal to unity, we see that the information associated
with a single selection is the logarithm of the number of symbols
available; for example, in the Baudot System referred to above, the
number s of primary symbols or current values is 2 and the informa-
tion content of one selection is log 2; that of a character which involves
5 selections is 5 log 2. The same result is obtained if we regard a
character as a secondary symbol and take the logarithm of the number
of these symbols, that is, log 25, or 5 log 2. The information associated
with 100 characters will be 500 log 2. The numerical value of the
information will depend upon the system of logarithms used. In-
creasing the number of current values from 2 to say 10, that is, in
the ratio 5, would increase the information content of a given number
of selections in the ratio me or 3.3. Its effect on the rate of
transmission will depend upon how the rate of making selections is
affected. This will be discussed later.

When, as in the case just considered, the secondary symbols all
involve the same number of primary selections, the relations are
quite simple. When a telegraph system is used which employs a
non-uniform code they are rather more complicated. A difficulty,
more apparent than real, arises from the fact that a given number
of secondary or character selections may necessitate widely different
numbers of primary selections, depending on the particular characters
chosen. This would seem to indicate that the values of information
deduced from the primary and secondary symbols would be different.
It may easily be shown, however, that this does not necessarily follow.

If the sender is at all times free to choose any secondary symbol,
he may make all of his selections from among those containing the
greatest number of primary symbols. The secondary symbols will
then all be of equal length, and, just as for the uniform code, the
number of primary symbols will be the product of the number of
characters by the maximum number of primary selections per char-
acter. If the number of primary selections for a given number of
characters is to be kept to some smaller value than this, some restric-
tion must be placed on the freedom of selection of the secondary
symbols. Such a restriction is imposed when, in computing the
average number of dots per character for a non-uniform code, we take
account of the average frequency of occurrence of the various char-
acters in telegraph messages. If this allotted number of dots per
character is not to be exceeded in sending a message, the operator
must, on the average, refrain from selecting the longer characters
more often than their average rate of occurrence. In the language
