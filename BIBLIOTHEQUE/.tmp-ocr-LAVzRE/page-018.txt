and phases of its various components in accordance with the known
admittance-frequency functions of the system, and obtain the ampli-
tude- and phase-frequency curves which represent the steady state
description of the received current. From these we deduce the miagni-
tude-time function representing the received wave.

A slightly different point of view, however, leads to results which
fit in better with our method of measuring information. We may
apply the method just outlined to deduce the magnitude-time function
which results when the applied wave consists merely of an instan-
taneous change in a steadily applied electromotive force from one
value which may be zero to another value differing from it by one unit.
The resulting wave form is characteristic of the system and has been
called by J. R. Carson its indicial admittance. We may think of this
as a transient description of the system. If we regard a continuously
varying applied wave as being formed by a succession of steps, we
may think of the received wave at any instant as being the resultant
of a series of waves each corresponding to a single step. The wave
form of each is that of the indicial admittance, its magnitude is
proportional to the size of the particular step and its location on the
time axis is determined by the time at which the particular step or
selection was made. When the steps are made infinitely close together,
a summation of these components becomes a process of integration
whereby the resulting magnitude-time function may be accurately
determined from the applied function. For the incompletely deter-
mined waves involved in communication where the separation of the
steps is finite a corresponding summation of the indicial admittance
curves resulting from all selections other than the one being observed
gives a measure of the intersymbol interference.

Still another viewpoint, while it has, perhaps, less direct application
to the present problem, is of interest in that it brings out the signifi-
cance from the transient standpoint of the steady state characteristics
of the system. If we take as the applied wave a mathematical impulse,
that is to say, a disturbance which lasts for an infinitesimal time,
we find that the amplitudes of its steady state components are the
same for all frequencies. If the impulse occurs at zero time the
phase-frequency curve coincides with the axis of frequency, and if not
it is a straight line through the origin whose slope is proportional to
the time of occurrence. In order to find the current resulting from
such an impulse applied at zero time we multiply the constant ampli-
tude-frequency curve of its steady state components by the amplitude-
frequency curve of the system and obtain as the amplitude-frequency
curve of the received wave a function of the same form as the ampli-
