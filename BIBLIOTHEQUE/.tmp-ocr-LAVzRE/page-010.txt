curved line. The accuracy with which he is able to accomplish this
will depend upon how far he goes between adjustments of the steering
mechanism and upon the number of positions in which he is able to
set it.

By this more or less artificial device the continuous magnitude-
time function as used in telephony is made subject to the same type
of treatment as the succession of discrete selections involved in
telegraphy.

RATE OF COMMUNICATION

So far then we have derived an expression for the information
content of the symbols at the sending end and have shown that we
may evaluate a transmission system in terms of how well the wave as
received over it permits distinguishing between the various possible
symbols which are available for each selection. Let us consider next
how the distortion of the system limits the rate of selection for which
these distinctions between symbols may be made with certainty.

Limitation by Intersymbol Interference

We shall assume the system to be free from external interference
and to be such that its current-voltage relations are linear. In such
a system the form of the transmitted wave may be altered due to
the storage of energy in reactive elements such as inductances and
capacities, and its subsequent release. To evaluate the effect of such
distortion in making it impossible to determine correctly which one
of the available symbols had been selected, we may think of this
distortion in terms of ‘intersymbol interference.’”’ In order to
determine the result of any one selection an observation is made at
such time that the disturbance resulting from that selection has its
maximum effect at the receiving end. Superposed on this effect
there will be a disturbance which is the resultant of the effects of all
the other symbols as prolonged by the storage of energy in the system.
This resultant superposed disturbance is what is meant by intersymbol
interference. Obviously if this disturbance is greater than half the
difference between the effects produced by two of the values available
for selection at the sending end, the wave resulting from one of those
values will be taken as representing the other. Thus a criterion for
successful transmission is that in no case shall the intersymbol inter-
ference exceed half the difference between the values of the wave at
the receiving end which correspond to the selection of different values
at the sending end.

Obviously the magnitude of the intersymbol interference which
affects any one symbol depends on the particular sequence of symbols
