Application to Picture Transmission

However, if in order to utilize fully the line-frequency-range we
introduce the process of recording, our message no longer exists
throughout its transmission as a magnitude-time function, but becomes
a magnitude-space function. Also in the case of picture transmission
the information to be transmitted exists originally as a magnitude-
space function. We may, of course, regard either a phonograph record
or a picture as a secondary symbol, and say that the information
transmitted consists of the sender’s selection of a particular record

or picture to which he desires to call the attention of the receiver.
The information involved in such a selection is then measured by the
logarithm of the number of different records or pictures which he
might have selected. The problem then is to analyze the magnitude-
space function which constitutes the secondary symbol into a sequence
of primary symbols. This may be done in a manner similar to that
already employed for magnitude-time functions.

The case of a phonograph record is directly analogous to those
already considered in that the magnitude is a function of the distance
along a single line. This distance is therefore analogous to time and
