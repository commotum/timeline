transient distortion corresponding to this steady state distortion must
result in intersymbol interference; hence it places a limit on the rate at
which distinguishable symbols may be selected, that is, on the rate
of transmitting information.

It does not necessarily follow, however, that the rate of transmission
with such a system is the maximum attainable for systems whose
transmission is limited to the frequency-range determined by the
cut-off of the filter. It is conceivable that by the introduction of
additional energy-storing elements the transfer admittance curves
for frequencies within the transmitted range may be altered in such a
way as to reduce the total intersymbol interference and so permit an
increased rate of selection. The maximum rate of transmission of
information which can be secured by such methods represents the
maximum rate corresponding to that range of frequencies.

Let us consider next the way in which this possible rate of trans-
mission varies with the cut-off frequency of the filter. The theory of
filter design teaches us that the cut-off frequency may be changed
without altering the required terminating resistances if we change all
inductances and capacities in the inverse ratio of the desired change
in cut-off frequency. Suppose this change in energy-storing elements,
with no change in dissipative elements, is made not only for the filter
but for the entire system. We have already seen that such a modifi-
cation changes the rate of transmission in the inverse ratio of the
change in energy-storing elements; that is, in the direct ratio of the
change in cut-off frequency in the present case. That the new rate
is the maximum for the new frequency-range is evident when we
consider that the transfer admittance curves of the new system bear
the same relation to its cut-off frequency as held in the original system.

This brings us to the important conclusion that the maximum rate
at which information may be transmitted over a system whose trans-
mission is limited to frequencies lying in a restricted range is propor-
tional to the extent of this frequency-range. From this it follows that
the total amount of information which may be transmitted over such a
system is proportional to the product of the frequency-range which it
transmits by the time during which it ts available for the transmission.
This product of transmitted frequency-range by time available is the
quantitative criterion for comparing transmission systems to which I
referred at the beginning of this discussion. The significance of this
criterion can perhaps best be brought out by applying it to some
typical situations.
