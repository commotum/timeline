in intensity with distance. The distance between successive maxima,
or the wave-length, will vary inversely with the frequency of the
applied alternating current. Figure 7 shows such a record of a speech
wave and of sinusoidal waves of two different frequencies. The
variations are superposed on a uniform component so as to avoid
the difficulty of negative light.

The frequency of an alternating current is defined as the number
of complete cycles which it executes in unit time. The analog of
frequency in the corresponding alternating space wave is therefore
the number of complete cycles or waves executed in unit distance.
This is the reciprocal of the wave-length just as the frequency is the
reciprocal of the period. Inasmuch as the term wave-number has
been used by physicists to designate the reciprocal of wave-length,
I shall use that term to designate the quantity corresponding to
frequency in the steady state analysis of a magnitude-distance function.
The distortion suffered by a picture in transmission may therefore be
expressed in terms of the steady state amplitude and phase distortions
as functions of wave number. Just as the transmission of a given
amount of information requires a given product of frequency-range
by time, so the preservation of a given amount of information ina
picture requires a corresponding product of wave-number-range by
distance. To illustrate, consider the effect of enlarging a picture
without changing its detail or fineness of intensity discrimination.
Suppose the enlargement to be made in two steps. In the first the
