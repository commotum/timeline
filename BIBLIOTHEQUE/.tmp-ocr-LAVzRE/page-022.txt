as the original but displaced to a new position on the frequency
scale determined by the carrier frequency. The interval which must
be allowed between these displaced messages in carrier operation is
determined by the selectivity of the filters which are available for
their separation. The imperfection of practical filters tends to make
the message-frequency-range which may be transmitted less than the
line-frequency-range which the messages occupy. The time for which
the line is used to transmit a given amount of information is the same
as the duration of the message conveying it. Thus the sum of the
products of frequency-range by time for the messages is always equal
to or less than the corresponding sum of the products of line-frequency-
range by time.

In case the line-range available is less than the message-range,
as would be the case in attempting to transmit speech over a submarine
telegraph cable, it is still possible, if enough lines are available, to
accomplish the transmission. The message wave may, by suitable
filters, be separated into a plurality of waves each made up of those
components of the original which lie in a portion of the message-
range which is no wider than the line-range. Each of these portions
of the message may then, by modulation, be transferred down to the
frequency-range of the line and each transmitted over a separate line.
A reversal of the process at the receiving end restores the original
message.

While it is theoretically possible, if enough messages and lines are
available, to fit the message-ranges to the line-ranges by modulation
and subdivision of message-frequency-ranges, it is not always practical.
It is sometimes more desirable to utilize the second method of trans-
formation already referred to. This consists in making a record of
the symbol sequence and reproducing it at a different speed in order
to secure the wave used in transmission. The tape used in sending
telegraph messages may be used in this manner. Here the symbol
sequence represents a series of selections of secondary symbols. These
selections are made at a rate at which it is convenient for the operator
to manipulate the keys of the tape-punching machine. The electric
wave impressed on the line by the holes in the tape represents a corre-
sponding sequence of primary symbols. The rate at which these are
applied to the line is determined by the velocity of the tape in repro-
duction. Since for a given number of different primary symbols the
frequency-range required is proportional to the rate of making selec-
tions, it is obvious that the frequency-range of the message as repro-
duced from the tape may be made to fit whatever line-frequency-
range is available, at least so far as width of the range is concerned.
