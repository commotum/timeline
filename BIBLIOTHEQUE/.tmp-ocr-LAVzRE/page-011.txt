TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 545

which precedes it. However, it is always possible for the sending
operator so to make his selections that any one selection is preceded
by that sequence which causes the maximum possible interference.
Hence every selection must be separated from those preceding it by at
least a certain interval which is determined by the worst condition of
interference. If longer intervals than this are used, the transmission
is unnecessarily retarded. Hence to secure the maximum rate of
transmission the selection should be made at aconstant rate. It might
appear at first sight that the selections could be made at shorter inter-
vals near the beginning of the message where there are fewer preceding
symbols to cause interference. This assumes, however, that the system
has previously been idle. Actually the previous user may have finished
his message with that sequence which causes maximum intersymbol
interference.
Relation to Damping Constant

How the intersymbol interference limits the rate of communication
over the system depends upon the properties of the particular system.
The relations involved are very complex, and no attempt will be made
to obtain a complete or rigorous solution of the problem. We may,
however, by treating a very simple case, arrive at an interesting
relation. Consider a resistance in series with a capacity. Let one
terminal be connected to one terminal of a battery made up of a very
large number of cells of negligible internal resistance. Let the other
terminal be connected to the battery through a switch. This switch
is so arranged that by pressing any one of s keys the circuit terminal
may be moved up along the battery by any number of cells from zero
tos —1. Let the sending operator make selections among the s keys
at regular intervals, and let the receiving operator observe the current
through the resistance. The most advantageous time for this observa-
tion is at the instant ! at which the key is pressed, since the current has
then its maximum value. The finest distinction to be made by the
receiving operator is that between two currents which result from
battery changes that differ from each other by one cell. The difference
between two such currents is equal to the initial current which flows
when one cell is introduced into the circuit. This is

E

ts
where E is the electromotive force of one cell and R the resistance of

the circuit.
1 Results identical with those which follow may be obtained if he observes the

average current over a period beginning when the key is pressed and lasting not
longer than the interval between selections.
