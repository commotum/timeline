STEADY STATE AND TRANSIENT VIEWPOINTS

So far very little has been said about frequencies, and in fact nothing
in the sense of the term in which our results are to be stated. By
this I mean the use of the word “frequency”’ as applied to an alter-
nating current or other sinusoidal disturbance in the so-called “steady
state.” The steady state viewpoint has proven very useful in certain
branches of communication, notably telephony. During the past few
years much progress has been made in establishing relations between
steady state phenomena and what might be called transient phenomena
of the sort which we have just been discussing. Before proceeding
with the main argument I shall attempt to review in non-mathematical
language the relationship of these two points of view to each other.

As its name implies, steady state analysis deals with continuing
conditions. If a sustained sinusoidal electromotive force be applied
at the sending end of a system, a sinusoidal current of the same
frequency flows at the receiving end. The vector ratio of the received
current to the sending electromotive force is known as the transfer
admittance of the system at that frequency. It is assumed ideally
that the driving electromotive force has been acting from the beginning
of time, and practically that it has been acting so long that the results
are indistinguishable from what would be obtained in the ideal case.
The absolute magnitude of the transfer admittance gives the amplitude
of the received current which results from a driving electromotive
force of unit amplitude, and its phase angle gives the phase of the
current relative to that of the driving electromotive force. The
curves which represent this amplitude and phase as functions of the
frequency constitute a steady state description of the transmission
properties of the system. For a system which is free from energy
storage such as a circuit containing resistances only, the transfer
admittance is the same for all frequencies. The amplitude-frequency
curve is a horizontal line whose position depends on the magnitude
and arrangement of the resistances while the phase-frequency curve
coincides with the frequency axis. The storage of energy in the
system and its subsequent release cause the admittance-frequency
curves to take other forms. If the only storage is that which occurs
in a dissipationless medium, a condition which is approximated when
a sound wave traverses the open air, the only effect is to make the
phase-frequency curve a straight line passing through the origin and
having a slope proportional to the time of transmission through the
