of the present discussion we would say that for certain of the m
secondary selections the value of sz, the number of secondary symbols,
is so reduced that a summation of the information content over all
the characters gives a value equal to that derived from the total
number of primary selections involved. This may be written

where n is the total number of primary symbols or dot lengths assigned
to m characters. This suggests that the primary symbols furnish
the most convenient basis for evaluating information.

The discussion so far has dealt largely with telegraphy. When
we attempt to extend this idea to other forms of communication
certain generalizations need to be made. In speech, for example, we
might assume the primary selections to represent the choice of succes-
sive words. On that basis s would represent the number of available
words. For the first word of a conversation this would correspond
to the number of words in the language. For subsequent selections
the number would ordinarily be reduced because subsequent words
would have to combine in intelligible fashion with those preceding.
Such limitations, however, are limitations of interpretation only and
the system would be just as capable of transmitting a communication
in which all possible permutations of the words of the language were
intelligible. Moreover, a telephone system may be just as capable of
transmitting speech in one language as in another. Each word may
be spoken in a variety of ways and sung in a still greater variety.
This very large amount of information associated withthe selection
of a single spoken word suggests that the word may better be regarded
as a secondary symbol, or sequence of primary symbols. Let us see
where this point of view leads us.

The actual physical embodiment of the word consists of an acoustic
or electrical disturbance which may be expressed as a magnitude-time
function as in Fig. 2, which shows an oscillographic record of a speech
sound. Such functions are also typical of other modes of communi-
cation, as will be discussed in more detail later. We have then to
examine the ability of such a continuous function to convey informa-
