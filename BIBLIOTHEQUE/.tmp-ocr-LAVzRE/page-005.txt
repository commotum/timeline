TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 539

The number of possible sequences of secondary symbols that can
result from 72 secondary selections is

$27 = gmna, (3)

Now 7% is the number # of selections of primary symbols that would
have been necessary to produce the same sequence had there been
no mechanism for grouping the primary symbols into secondary
symbols. Thus we see that the total number of possible sequences
is s" regardless of whether or not the primary symbols are grouped
for purposes of interpretation.

This number s” is then the number of possible sequences which we
set out to find in the hope that it could be used as a measure of the
information involved. Let us see how well it meets the requirements
of such a measure.

For a particular system and mode of operation s may be assumed
to be fixed and the number of selections » increases as the communi-
cation proceeds. Hence with this measure the amount of information
transmitted would increase exponentially with the number of selections
and the contribution of a single selection to the total information
transmitted would progressively increase. Doubtless some such
increase does often occur in communication as viewed from the
psychological standpoint. For example, the single word “yes” or
“no,” when coming at the end of a protracted discussion, may have
an extraordinarily great significance. However, such cases are the
exception rather than the rule. The constant changing of the subject
of discussion, and even of the individuals involved, has the effect in
practice of confining the cumulative action of this exponential relation
to comparatively short periods.

Moreover we are setting up a measure which is to be independent of
psychological factors. When we consider a physical transmission
system we find no such exponential increase in the facilities necessary
for transmitting the results of successive selections. The various
primary symbols involved are just as distinguishable at the receiving
end for one primary selection as for another. A telegraph system
finds one ten-word message no more difficult to transmit than the one
which preceded it. A telephone system which transmits speech suc-
cessfully now will continue to do so as long as the system remains
unchanged. In order then for a measure of information to be of
practical engineering value it should be of such a nature that the in-
formation is proportional to the number of selections. The number of
possible sequences is therefore not suitable for use directly as a measure
of information.
