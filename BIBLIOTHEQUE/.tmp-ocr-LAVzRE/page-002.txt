THE MEASUREMENT OF INFORMATION

When we speak of the capacity of a system to transmit information
we imply some sort of quantitative measure of information. As
commonly used, information is a very elastic term, and it will first be
necessary to set up for it a more specific meaning as applied to the
present discussion. As a starting place for this let us consider what
factors are involved in communication; whether conducted by wire,
direct speech, writing, or any other method. In the first place, there
must be a group of physical symbols, such as words, dots and dashes or
the like, which by general agreement convey certain meanings to the
parties communicating. In any given communication the sender
mentally selects a particular symbol and by some bodily motion, as
of his vocal mechanism, causes the attention of the receiver to be
directed to that particular symbol. By successive selections a
sequence of symbols is brought to the listener's attention. At each
selection there are eliminated all of the other symbols which might
have been chosen. As the selections proceed more and more possible
symbol sequences are eliminated, and we say that the information
becomes more precise. For example, in the sentence, ‘‘Apples are
red,” the first word eliminates other kinds of fruit and all other objects
ingeneral. The second directs attention to some property or condition
of apples, and the third eliminates other possible colors. It does
not, however, eliminate possibilities regarding the size of apples, and
this further information may be conveyed by subsequent selections.

Inasmuch as the precision of the information depends upon what
other symbol sequences might have been chosen it would seem reason-
able to hope to find in the number of these sequences the desired
quantitative measure of information. The number of symbols
available at any one selection obviously varies widely with the type
of symbols used, with the particular communicators and with the
degree of previous understanding existing between them. For two
persons who speak different languages the number of symbols available
is negligible as compared with that for persons who speak the same
language. It is desirable therefore to eliminate the psychological
factors involved and to establish a measure of information in terms
of purely physical quantities.

Elimination of Psychological Factors

To illustrate how this may be done consider a hand-operated
submarine telegraph cable system in which an oscillographic recorder
traces the received message on a photosensitive tape. Suppose the
