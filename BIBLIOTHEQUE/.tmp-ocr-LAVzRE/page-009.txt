TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 543

tion. Obviously over any given time interval the magnitude may
vary in accordance with an infinite number of such functions. This
would mean an infinite number of possible secondary symbols, and
hence an infinite amount of information. In practice, however, the
information contained is finite for the reason that the sender is unable
to control the form of the function with complete accuracy, and any
distortion of its form tends to cause it to be confused with some
other function.

A continuous curve may be thought of as the limit approached by
a curve made up of successive steps, as shown in Fig. 3, when the
interval between the steps is made infinitesimal. An imperfectly
defined curve may then be thought of as one in which the interval
between the steps is finite. The steps then represent primary selec-
tions. The number of selections in a finite time is finite. Also the
change made at each step is to be thought of as limited to one of a
finite number of values. This means that the number of available
symbols is kept finite. If this were not the case, the curve would be
defined with complete exactness at each of the steps, which would
mean that an observation made at any one step would offer the
possibility of distinguishing among an infinite number of possible
values. The following illustration may serve to bring out the relation
between the discrete selections and the corresponding continuous
curve. We may think of a bicycle equipped with a peculiar type of
steering device which permits the rider to set the front wheel in only
a limited number of fixed positions. On such a machine he attempts
to ride in such a manner that the front wheel shall follow an irregularly
