# Receptive Fields, Binocular Interaction and Functional Architecture in the Cat's Visual Cortex (1962)
Source: 0dfee8-1962.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is a neurophysiology study focused on receptive fields and functional architecture in the cat visual cortex, not on machine learning models.
- It reports experimental recordings from cats with physiological methods, indicating cross-disciplinary biological research rather than ML methods or datasets.

## Evidence extracts
- "RECEPTIVE FIELDS, BINOCULAR INTERACTION AND FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE IN THE CAT’S VISUAL CORTEX" (p. 106)
- "Recordings were made from forty acutely prepared cats, anaesthetized with thiopental" (p. 107)
