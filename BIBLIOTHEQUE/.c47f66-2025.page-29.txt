                            GPT-4o(Standard Setting): To calculate the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for 2014, we'll follow these
                            steps:1. Calculate the cost of the market basket in each year.   - The market basket consists of 200
                            apples and 290 textbooks.2. Calculate the base year (2015) cost of the market basket. - Cost in 2015 =
                            (200 apples * $1.10/apple) + (290 textbooks * $140/textbook)    - Cost in 2015 = (200 * $1.10) + (290 *
                            $140)   - Cost in 2015 = $220 + $40,600   - Cost in 2015 = $40,8203. Calculate the cost of the market
                            basket in 2014. - Cost in 2014 = (200 apples * $1.40/apple) + (290 textbooks * $200/textbook) - Cost
                            in 2014 = (200 * $1.40) + (290 * $200)  - Cost in 2014 = $280 + $58,000    - Cost in 2014 = $58,2804.
                            Calculate the CPI for 2014.  - CPI = (Cost of market basket in 2014 / Cost of market basket in base
                            year 2015) * 100 - CPI = ($58,280 / $40,820) * 100 - CPI = 1.427570 * 100 - CPI ‚âà 143So, the CPI for

                            Step-by-Step Solution: 1. Calculate the cost of the market basket for each year: Market basket in 2015
                            (base year): (200 Apples √ó $1.10) + (290 Textbooks √ó $140) = $220 + $40,600 = $40,820 - Market basket
                            in 2014: (200 Apples √ó $1.40) + (290 Textbooks √ó $200) = $280 + $58,000 = $58,280; 2. Calculate the
