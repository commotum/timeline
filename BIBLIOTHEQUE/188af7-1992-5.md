# Q-Learning (1992)
Source: 188af7-1992.pdf

## Core reasons
- Presents Q-learning as a model-free reinforcement learning method, establishing a foundational ML algorithm rather than a transformer or dataset contribution.
- Provides theoretical grounding by proving convergence properties of the Q-learning method.

## Evidence extracts
- "Q-learning (Watkins, 1989) is a form of model-free reinforcement learning." (p. 1)
- "This paper presents the proof outlined by Watkins (1989) that Q-learning converges." (p. 1)
