# Fixed Point Diffusion Models (2024)
Source: a47c32-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper centers on an implicit fixed-point layer that turns diffusion sampling into fixed-point solving, changing how computation is performed.
- The architecture replaces explicit layers with an implicit fixed point layer, indicating a computation mechanism proposal rather than a data or positional encoding contribution.

## Evidence extracts
- "implicit fixed point layer into a denoising diffusion model, converting the sampling process into a sequence of fixed point equations." (p. 1)
- "replaces the explicit layers in-between with an implicit fixed point layer." (p. 2)
