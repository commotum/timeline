# ProofWriter: Generating Implications, Proofs, and Abductive Statements over Natural Language (2021)
Source: 82aa46-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes an iterative generative reasoning mechanism (ProofWriter) that builds proofs by generating 1-step implications.
- The primary contribution is a new method for proof generation over natural language theories, not positional encoding, dimensional lifting, or dataset-only work.

## Evidence extracts
- "iterating a 1-step implication generator results
  in proofs that are highly reliable, and represent
  actual model decisions (rather than post-hoc
  rationalizations)." (p. 1, Abstract)
- "A new method for proof generation for logical
  reasoning over natural language, that obtains
  state-of-the-art results and is faithful to the
  model's internal decisions." (p. 2)
