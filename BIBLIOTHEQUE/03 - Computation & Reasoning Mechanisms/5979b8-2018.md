# Recurrent Relational Networks (2018)
Source: 5979b8-2018.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a recurrent relational network to enable many-step relational inference tasks, addressing the need for multi-step reasoning.
- Defines an iterative message-passing computation that updates node states over steps as the core reasoning mechanism.

## Evidence extracts
- "This paper is concerned with learning to solve tasks that require a chain of interde- pendent steps of relational inference, like answering complex questions about the relationships between objects, or solving puzzles where the smaller elements of a solution mutually constrain each other." (p. 1)
- "In an iteration t, these messages are sent simultaneously, in parallel, between all cells. Each cell i should then consider all incoming messages, and update its internal state ht to ht+1. With the updated state each cell should send out new messages, and the process repeats." (p. 2)
