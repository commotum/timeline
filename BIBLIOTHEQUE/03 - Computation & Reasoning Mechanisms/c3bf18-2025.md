# Hierarchical Reasoning Model (2025)
Source: c3bf18-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes HRM as a new recurrent architecture aimed at increasing computational depth for reasoning tasks.
- Introduces a computation mechanism with two coupled recurrent modules (high-level planning and low-level computation) rather than standard feedforward inference.

## Evidence extracts
- "we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both train- ing stability and efficiency." (p. 1)
- "HRM is designed to significantly increase the effective compu- tational depth. It features two coupled recurrent modules: a high-level (H) module for abstract, deliberate reasoning, and a low-level (L) module for fast, detailed computations." (p. 2)
