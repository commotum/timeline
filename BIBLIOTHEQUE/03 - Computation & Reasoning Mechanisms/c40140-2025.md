# Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks (2025)
Source: c40140-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a Tiny Recursion Model that changes computation via recursive reasoning to iteratively improve answers with a tiny network.
- Motivated by limitations of LLMs on hard question-answer tasks, framing a need for stronger reasoning mechanisms than standard autoregressive inference.

## Evidence extracts
- "Figure 1. Tiny Recursion Model (TRM) recursively improves its predicted answer y with a tiny network." (Figure 1)
- "Whilepowerful,LargeLanguagemodels(LLMs)can struggle on hard question-answer problems." (Introduction)
