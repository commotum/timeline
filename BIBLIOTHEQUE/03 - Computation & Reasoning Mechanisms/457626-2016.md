# Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory (2016)
Source: 457626-2016.pdf

## Core reasons
- Identifies a missing capability in standard neural networks: inability to represent variables/data structures and store data over long timescales due to lack of external memory.
- Proposes a new computation mechanism (DNC) that adds read/write access to an external memory matrix.

## Evidence extracts
- "Artificial neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing, sequence learning and reinforcement learning, but are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales, owing to the lack of an external memory." (p. 1)
- "Here we introduce a machine learning model called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer." (p. 1)
