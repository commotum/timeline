# A Prototype for Data-Driven Visual Attention (1992)
Source: 16a6e9-1992.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes an explicit attention mechanism (an attention beam traversing a processing hierarchy) that changes how computation proceeds in visual processing.
- Motivates attention as required for tractable computation, framing the mechanism as essential for reducing processing load.

## Evidence extracts
- "This  paper  presents    an  attentional   prototype  for  early  vi- sual processing.    Our  model  is  composed  of  a processing  hi- erarchy  and  an  attention    beam  that  traverses  the  hierarchy, passing  through  the  regions  of  greatest  interest  and  inhibit- ing  the  regions  that  are  not  relevant." (Abstract)
- "Vision problems  whose  solution does not include            atten- tional  influences  have  been  shown  to  be computationally intractable   [18]." (Section 1 Introduction)
