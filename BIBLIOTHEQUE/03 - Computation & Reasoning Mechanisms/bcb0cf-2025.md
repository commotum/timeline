# MINDOVERBODY: ADAPTIVE THINKING USING DYNAMIC COMPUTATION (2025)
Source: bcb0cf-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes an introspection mechanism that adaptively allocates computation by selecting how much processing to apply based on input complexity.
- Core contribution changes the computation process (dynamic layer use and adaptive effort) rather than focusing on data resources or positional encoding.

## Evidence extracts
- "This enables the network to adaptively reuse parameters across tasks, dynamically adjusting computational effort to match input complexity." (p. 1)
- "The introspection network serves as the central unit that assesses the complexity of the input and the current activation states, dynamically adjusting the computational graph of the prediction network to optimize resource allocation and computational efficiency for specified tasks." (p. 3)
