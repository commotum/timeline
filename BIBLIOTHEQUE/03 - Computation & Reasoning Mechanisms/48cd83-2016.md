# Neural Module Networks (2016)
Source: 48cd83-2016.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes neural module networks that dynamically lay out deep networks from reusable modules for each question, changing the computation per input.
- Frames the contribution as a framework for modular, composable neural networks assembled into arbitrary deep networks, i.e., a mechanism for compositional reasoning.

## Evidence extracts
- "Our approach uses a natural language parser to dy-
  namically lay out a deep network composed of reusable modules." (p. 1)
- "In this paper, we have introduced
  neural module net-
  works
  , which provide a general-purpose framework for
  learning collections of neural modules which can be dy-
  namically assembled into arbitrary deep networks." (p. 8)
