h. Optimization of x, y, and 0

Given a mutually consistent set of constraints, No» M, Sax? and
Po Rorit? the optimum system (in which Po is minimized for any stimulus)
is given by the simultaneous solutions of the following three equations,
subject to the limits indicated. If a set of constraints does not permit
a solution within these limits, this indicates that the constraints are

mutually inconsistent, and consequently inadmissible as design criteria.

The constraints are defined as follows:
Ny = number of S-points in the raster.
M = maximum number of input connections allowed to each A-unit.

The system performance will be improved by setting M as
high as possible. (M= X+¥ No).

s) = maximum stimulus size (number of S-points) to which the

system must be able to respond (N. M<, Sax < Ng M)

The system's performance will be improved by setting
