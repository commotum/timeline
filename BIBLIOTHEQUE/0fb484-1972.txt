Coupled
nonlinear
differential
equations
are
derived
for
the
dynamics
of
spatially
localized
populations
containing
both
excitatory
and
inhibitory
model
neurons.
Phase
plane
methods
and
numerical
solutions
are
then
used
to
investigate
population
responses
to
various
types
of
stimuli.
The
results
obtained
show
simple
and
multiple
hysteresis
phenomena
and
limit
cycle
activity.
The
latter
is
particularly
interesting
since
the
frequency
of
the
limit
cycle
oscillationis
found
to
be
a
monotonic
function
of
stimulus
intensity.
Finally,
it
is
proved
that
the
existence
of
limit
cycle
dynamics
in
response
to
one
class
of
stimuli
implies
the
existence
of
multiple
stable
states
and
hysteresis
in
response
to
a
different
class
of
stimuli.
The
relation
between
these
findings
and
a
number
of
experiments
is
discussed.
INTRODUCTION
It
is
probably
true
that
studies
of
primitive
nervous
systems
should
be
focused
on
individual
nerve
cells
and
their
precise,
genetically
determined
interactions
with
other
cells.
Although
such
an
approach
may
also
be
appropriate
for
many
parts
of
the
mammalian
nervous
system,
it
is
not
necessarily
suited
to
an
investigation
of
those
parts
which
are
associated
with
higher
functions,
such
as
sensory
information
processing
and
the
attendant
complexities
of
learning,
memory
storage,
and
pattern
recognition.
There
are
several
reasons
why
a
shift
in
emphasis
is
warranted
in
the
investigation
of
such
problems.
There
is
first
of
all
the
pragmatic
point
that
since
sensory
information
is
introduced
into
the
nervous
system
in
the
form
of
large-
scale
spatiotemporal
activity
in
sheets
of
cells,
the
number
of
cells
involved
is
simply
too
vast
for
any
approach
starting
at
the
single
cell
level
to
be
tractable.
Closely
related
to
this
is
the
observation
that
since
pattern
recognition
is
in
some
sense
a
global
process,
it
is
unlikely
that
approaches
which
emphasize
only
local
properties
will
provide
much
insight.
Finally,
it
is
at
least
a
reasonable
hypothesis
that
local
interactions
between
nerve
cells
are
largely
random,
but
that
this
local

randomness
gives
rise
to
quite
precise
long-range
interactions.
Here
an
example
from
physics
suggests
itself.
If
a
fluid
is
observed
at
the
molecular
level,
what
is
seen
is
brownian
motion,
whereas
the
same
fluid,
viewed
macroscopically,
may
be
under-
going
very
orderly
streamlined
flow.
Following
up
this
analogy,
we
shall
develop
a
deterministic
model
for
the
dynamics
of
neural
populations.
This
may
be
inter-
preted
as
a
treatment
of
the
mean
values
of
the
underlying
statistical
processes.
In
view
of
these
remarks,
we
introduce
a
model
which
emphasizes
not
the
in-
dividual
cell
but
rather
the
properties
of
populations.
The
cells
comprising
such
populations
are
assumed
to
be
in
close
spatial
proximity,
and
their
interconnections
are
assumed
to
be
random,
yet
dense
enough
so
that
it
is
very
probable
that
there
will
be
at
least
one
path
(either
direct
or
via
interneurons)
connecting
any
two
cells
within
the
population.
Under
these
conditions
we
may
neglect
spatial
interactions
and
deal
simply
with
the
temporal
dynamics
of
the
aggregate.'
Consistent
with
this
approach,
we
have
chosen
as
the
relevant
variable
(following
Beurle,
1956)
the
proportion
of
cells
in
the
population
which
become
active
per
unit
time.
This
im-
plies
that
the
relevant
aspect
of
single
cell
activity
is
not
the
single
spike
but
rather
spike
frequency.
Furthermore,
time
will
be
treated
as
a
continuous
variable
so
as
to
avoid
the
introduction
of
the
spurious
oscillations
often
found
when
a
differential
dynamical
system
is
treated
by
finite
difference
equations.
Physiological
evidence
for
the
existence
of
spatially
localized
neural
populations
is
provided
by
the
work
of
Mountcastle
(1957)
and
Hubel
and
Wiesel
(1963,
1965).
Their
findings
indicate
that
even
within
relatively
small
volumes
of
cortical
tissue
there
exist
many
cells
with
very
nearly
identical
responses
to
identical
stimuli:
there
is
a
high
degree
of
local
redundancy.2
It
is
just
such
local
redundancy
which
must
be
invoked
to
justify
characterizing
spatially
localized
neural
populations
by
a
single
variable.
Local
redundancy
in
the
cerebral
cortex
has
also
been
inferred
from
ana-
tomical
evidence
(Szentagothai,
1967;
Colonnier,
1965).
There
is
one
final
and
crucial
assumption
upon
which
this
study
rests:
all
nervous
processes
of
any
complexity
are
dependent
upon
the
interaction
of
excitatory
and
inhibitory
cells.
This
assertion
is
supported
by
the
work
of
Hartline
and
Ratliff
(1958),
Hubel
and
Wiesel
(1963,
1965),
Freeman
(1967,
1968
a,
b),
Szentaigothai
(1967),
and
many
others.
In
fact,
this
assumption
is
virtually
a
truism
at
this
point,
yet
many
neural
modelers
have
dealt
with
nets
composed
entirely
of
excitatory
cells
(Beurle,
1956;
Farley
and
Clark,
1961;
ten
Hoopen,
1965;
Allanson,
1956).
It
was
just
this
failure
to
consider
inhibition
that
led
Ashby
et
al.
(1962)
to
conclude
that
the
dynamical
stability
of
the
brain
was
paradoxical,
and
it
was
the
introduction
of
The
neglect
of
spatial
interactions
is
only
temporary;
a
paper
dealing
with
the
extension
of
the
present
model
to

distributed
neural
populations
is
in
preparation
(Wilson
and
Cowan).
'
Local
redundancy
has
been
used
before
by
Von
Neumann
(1956)
and
Winograd
and
Cowan
(1963)
to
account
for
the
reliability
of
information
processing
in
neural
nets.
In
the
latter
work
the
neural
nets
had
properties
analogous
to
the
ones
discussed
in
this
paper:

inhibition
by
Griffith
(1963)
which
dissolved
the
paradox.
Consequently,
we
take
it
to
be
essential
that
there
be
both
excitatory
and
inhibitory
cells
within
any
local
neural
population.
We
shall
therefore
speak
of
a
localized
neural
population
as
being
composed
of
an
excitatory
subpopulation
and
an
inhibitory
subpopulation.
This
will
require
a
two-variable
description
of
the
population.3
THE
MODEL
In
accordance
with
the
preceding
remarks,
we
define
as
the
variables
characterizing
the
dynamics
of
a
spatially
localized
neural
population:
E(t)
=
proportion
of
excitatory
cells
firing
per
unit
time
at
the
instant
t;
I(t)
=
proportion
of
inhibitory
cells
firing
per
unit
time
at
the
instant
t.
The
state
E(t)
=
0,
I(t)
=
0,
the
resting
state,
will
be
taken
to
be
a
state
of
low-level
background
activity,
since
such
activity
seems
ubiquitous
in
neural
tissue.
Therefore,
small
negative
values
of
E
and
I
will
have
physiological
significance,
representing
depression
of
resting
activity.
E(t)
and
I(t)
will
be
referred
to
as
the
activities
in
the
respective
subpopulations.
We
now
derive
the
equations
satisfied
by
E(t)
and
I(t).
By
assumption
the
value
of
these
functions
at
time
(t
+
r)
will
be
equal
to
the
proportion
of
cells
which
are
sensitive
(i.e.,
not
refractory)
and
which
also
receive
at
least
threshold
excitation
at
time
t.
We
shall
first
obtain
independent
expressions
for
the
proportion
of
sensitive
cells
and
for
the
proportion
of
cells
receiving
at
least
threshold
excitation.
If
the
absolute
refractory
period
has
a
duration
of
r
msec,
then
the
proportion
of
excitatory
cells
which
are
refractory
will
evidently
be
given
by4
J
E(t')
dt'.
Consequently,
the
proportion
of
excitatory
cells
which
are
sensitive
is
just
1
-
E(t')
dt'.
Similar
expressions
are
obtained
for
the
inhibitory
subpopulation.
The
functions

the
expected
proportions
of
the
subpopulations
receiving
at
Cowan

in
which,
however,
the
fundamental
variables
are
the
mean
rates
of
firing
of
individual
excitatory
and
inhibitory
cells
rather
than
of
subpopulations.
I
No
account
is
taken
of
relative
refractoriness.
An
extended
model
which
includes
a
refractory
period
after
any
desired
time
course
is
given
in
the
Appendix;
however,
the
complexity
of
the
ex-
tended
model
is
such
that
any
detailed
examination
of
the
effects
of
relative
refractoriness
must
await
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
present
simpler
model.

least
threshold
excitation
per
unit
time
as
a
function
of
the
average
levels
of
excita-
tion
within
the
subpopulations
will
be
called
subpopulation
response
functions
and
designated
by
Se(x)
and
3i(x).
We
call
8.(x)
and
3,(x)
response
functions
because
they
give
the
expected
proportion
of
cells
in
a
subpopulation
which
would
respond
to
a
given
level
of
excitation
if
none
of
them
were
initially
in
the
absolute
refractory
state.
The
general
form
of
these
functions
can
be
derived
in
several
ways.
Assume
first
that
there
is
a
distribution
of
individual
neural
thresholds
within
a
subpopulation
characterized
by
the
distribution
function
D(O).
If
it
is
further
as-
sumed
that
all
cells
receive
the
same
numbers
of
excitatory
and
inhibitory
afferents,
then
on
the
average
all
cells
will
be
subjected
to
the
same
average
excitation
x(t),
and
the
subpopulation
response
function
S(x)
will
take
the
form:
8(x)
=
[
D(@)
dO.
(1)
Alternatively,
assume
that
all
cells
within
a
subpopulation
have
the
same
thresh-
old
0,
but
let
there
be
a
distribution
of
the
number
of
afferent
synapses
per
cell.
If
C(w)
is
the
synaptic
distribution
function
and
x(t)
the
average
excitation
per
synapse,
then
all
cells
with
at
least
O/x(t)
synapses
will
be
expected
to
receive
sufficient
excitation.
Thus,
the
subpopulation
response
function
takes
the
form:
rx
8(x)
=
f
C(w)
dw.
a
The
validity
of
both
of
these
formulas
of
course
rests
on
the
assumption
that
the
total
number
of
afferents
reaching
a
cell
is
sufficiently
large,
for
it
is
only
in
this
case
that
all
cells
will
be
subjected
to
approximately
the
same
x(t).
S(x)
as
defined
in
either
equations
1
or
1
a
is
readily
seen
to
be
a
monotonically
increasing
function
of
x(t)
with
a
lower
asymptote
of
0
and
an
upper
asymptote
of
1.
If
in
addition
D(O)
or
C(w)
is
a
unimodal
distribution,
the
response
function
will
assume
a
sigmoid
form
such
as
that
shown
in
Fig.
1.
It
is
this
sigmoid
form
which
will
be
taken
to
be
characteristic
of
any
acceptable
subpopulation
response
func-
tion.
Any
functionf(x)
will
be
said
to
belong
to
the
class
of
sigmoid
functions
if:
(a)
f(x)
is
a
monotonically
increasing
function
of
x
on
the
interval
(-
c,
co),
(b)
f(x)
approaches
or
attains
the
asymptotic
values
0
and
1
as
x
approaches
-a
and
o
respectively,
or
(c)f(x)
has
one
and
only
one
inflection
point.
This
inflection
point
will
be
termed
the
subpopulation
threshold,
although
it
is
related
to
the
single
cell
thresholds
only
through
equations
1
or
1
a.
There
are
several
points
to
be
made
concerning
the
sigmoid
shape
of
the
sub-
population
response
function.
First,
the
phenomenological
significance
of
the
sigmoid
shape
is
intuitively
clear:
in
a
population
of
threshold
elements
too
low
a
level
of
excitation
will
fail
to
excite
any
elements,
while
very
strong
excitation
can
do
BIOPHYSICAL
JOURNAL
VOLUME

--- Page 5 ---
more
than
excite
all
of
the
elements
in
the
population.
Second,
a
number
of
experi-
mental
studies
have
shown
that
single
cell
response
curves
are
sigmoid
functions
of
excitation
(Kernell,
1965
a,
b)
as
well
as
population
response
curves
(Rall,
1955
a,
b,
c).
Finally,
it
may
be
noted
that
the
response
function
is
essentially
the
event
density
of
renewal
theory
(Cox,
1962).
The
event
density
is
known
to
be
related
to
a
sum
of
convolutions
of
first-passage
time
densities
for
the
single
units
of
the
popula-
tion.
The
relationship
of
the
subpopulation
response
function
to
the
first-passage
density
has
been
explored
more
fully
by
Cowan
(1971).
Before
proceeding
it
should
be
mentioned
that
if
D(O)
or
C(w)
is
multimodal,
S(x)
will
still
be
monotonic
but
will
not
be
sigmoid
as
defined
above.
Rather
than
a
unique
inflection
point,
there
will
be
one
inflection
point
for
each
mode
of
the
dis-
tribution,
as
is
shown
in
Fig.
2
for
the
bimodal
case.
For
an
n-modal
distribution,
however,
8(x)
can
always
be
written
as
a
weighted
sum
of
n
sigmoid
functions
having
different
inflection
points.
Physiologically,
a
multimodal
distribution
would
be
expected
to
correspond
to
the
presence
of
a
number
of
distinct
cell
types
within
the
subpopulation.
For
the
present
we
shall
take
8(x)
to
be
a
single
sigmoid
function,
but
we
will
return
briefly
to
the
more
complex
case
later.
An
expression
for
the
average
level
of
excitation
generated
in
a
cell
of
each
sub-
population
must
now
be
obtained.
If
it
is
assumed
that
individual
cells
sum
their
inputs
and
that
the
effect
of
stimulation
decays
with
a
time
course
a(t),
then
the
average
level
of
excitation
generated
in
an
excitatory
cell
at
time
t
will
be:

of
excitatory
and
inhibitory
synapses
per
cell,
while
P(t)
is
the
external
input
to
the
excitatory
subpopulation.
A
similar
expression
but
with
different
coefficients
and
a
different
external
input
will
apply
to
the
inhibitory
subpopulation.
The
differing
coefficients
reflect
differences
in
axonal
and
dendritic
geometry
between
the
excita-
tory
and
inhibitory
cell
types,
while
the
difference
in
external
inputs
assumes
the
existence
of
cell-type
specific
afferents
to
the
population.
Given
these
expressions
for
the
subpopulation
response
functions,
the
average
excitation,
and
the
proportion
of
sensitive
cells
in
each
subpopulation,
we
may
now
obtain
equations
for
the
activities
E(t)
and
I(t).
As
we
have
noted,
the
activity
in
a
subpopulation
at
time
(t
+
r)
will
be
equal
to
the
proportion
of
cells
which
are
both
sensitive
and
above
threshold
at
time
t.
If
the
probability
that
a
cell
is
sensitive
is
independent
of
the
probability
that
it
is
currently
excited
above
its
threshold,
then
the
desired
expression
for
the
excitatory
subpopulation
is
just:
[1
-;
f
E(t')
dt']
S.(x)5t.
In
general,
however,
there
will
be
some
correlation
between
the
level
of
excitation
of
a
cell
and
the
probability
that
it
is
sensitive.
Furthermore,
this
correlation
will
tend
to
reduce
the
value
of
the
expression
just
obtained.
This
is
so
because
cells
which
are
currently
highly
excited
are
more
likely
to
have
been
highly
excited
in
the
recent
past
and
thus
are
more
likely
to
have
already

Designat-
ing
this

between

becomes:

Although
the
particular
functional
form
of
'y
will
depend
on
the
details
of
the
con-
nectivity

within
the

it

In
the
case
we
are
considering,
that
of
a
richly
interconnected
population
of
cells,
max
(y)
will
generally
be
very
small.
There
are
two
reasons
for
this.
The
first
is
the
presence
of
spatial
and
temporal
fluctuations
in
the
average
level
of
excitation
within
the
population
caused
both
by
the
presence
of
fluctuations
in
the
inputs
and
by
the
activity
due
to
firing
of
cells
within
the
population.
The
second
is
the
existence
of
fluctuations
in
the
thresholds
of
the
individual
cells
themselves
(Frishkopf
and
Rosenblith,
1958;
Verveen
and
Derksen,
1969;
Rall
and
Hunt,
1956).
In
the
present
study,
therefore,
we
shall
take
-y
to
be
zero,
thus
dealing
with
the
case
in
which
sensitivity
is
not
correlated
with
level
of
excitation.
It
follows
that
the
equations
governing
the
dynamics
of
a
localized
population
of
neurons
are:
E(t
+
)=[I-
JE(t')
dt']
*
a(t
-
t')[cE(t')
-
c2I(t')
+
P(t')]

and

=

I(t')

S
{f

for
the
excitatory
and
inhibitory
subpopulations.
TIME
COARSE
GRAINING
Equations
3
and
4
are
intuitively
simple
in
that
each
term
has
been
shown
to
have
a
clear
physiological
interpretation.
Mathematically,
however,
they
are
extremely
complex
both
because
of
their
strongly
nonlinear
character
and
because
they
involve
temporal
integrals.
The
nonlinearity
is
a
fundamental
characteristic
of
this
as
well
as
most
other
biological
control
systems.
The
presence
of
temporal
integrals,
how-
ever,
is
an
aspect
of
lesser
significance
biologically,
as
will
now
be
shown.
The
mathematical
advantage
to
be
gained
from
the
removal
of
the
time
integrals
will
be
the
applicability
of
phase
plane
analysis
to
extract
significant
qualitative
features
of
the
solutions
of
equations
3
and
4
for
various
parameter
ranges
and
initial
condi-
tions.
The
technique
we
will
use
to
simplify
equations
3
and
4
is
a
form
of
temporal
coarse
graining,
which
was
first
applied
by
Kirkwood
(1946)
to
some
problems
in
statistical
physics.
Although
we
shall
not
follow
the
original
arguments
precisely,
the
basis
of
the
method
is
the
replacement
of
the
dependent
variable,
e.g.
f(t),
by
the
moving
time
average
of
this
quantity
over
some
appropriately
chosen
interval

s.
The
coarse-grained
variable,f(t),
is
thus
given
by:
f(t)
=
!ff(t')
dt'.
(5)
Obviously,
the
effect
of
this
change
of
variable
is
to
average
out
rapid
temporal
variations
taking
place
on
a
time
scale
shorter
than
s.
To
justify
the
use
of
the
temporal
coarse-graining
approximation,
therefore,
it
is
necessary
to
show
that
the
behavior
which
is
lost
through
averaging
is
not
of
significance
for
the
problem
at
hand.
To
obtain
the
appropriate
coarse-grained
forms
for
equations
3
and
4,
notice
first
that
E(t)
and
I(t)
appear
on
the
right
side
of
these
equations
only
in
the
form
of
time-averaged
quantities.
If
a(t)
is
close
to
unity
for
0
<
t
<
r
and
drops
fairly
rapidly
to
zero
for
t
>
r,
then
it
is
a
reasonable
approximation
to
replace
both
these
integrals
by
the
same
coarse-grained
variables.
That
is,
J
E(t')
dt'
rE(t)-
L
a(t
-
t')E(t')
dt'
kE(t)
(6)
with
k
and
r
constant.
Similar
replacements
apply
to
I(t).
As
time
coarse
graining
has
a
marked
smoothing
effect
on
temporal
variation,
it
is
appropriate
to
replace
E(t
+
r)
and
I(t
+
r')
in
equations
3
and
4
by
Taylor
expansions
in
the
coarse-grained
variable
about
the
value
r
=
0.
Thus,
we
arrive
at
the
time
coarse-grained
form
of
equations
3
and
4:
r
dE
=
-_
+
(1-
rE)3,[kc1R
-
c2k
+
kP(t)],
(7)
t
=
-i
+
(1
-
r7)i[k'cs
E
-
c4k'I
+
k'Q(t)].
(8)
In
order
to
assess
the
appropriateness
of
the
coarse-graining
approximation,
we
have
compared
computer
solutions
to
equation
3
with
those
obtained
from
equation
7.
For
this
purpose
equation
3
was
expanded
to
lowest
order
in
r,
and
a(t
-
t')
was
taken
to
be
an
exponential
decay.
Interaction
with
the
inhibitory
subpopulation
was
excluded
from
both
equations
3
and
7
to
simplify
the
comparison.
Thus
we
are
concerned
with
the
equations:
t
=
-E
+
[1
-f
E(t')
dt']
se
{L
e'(t-
[c

The
major
difference
that
is
observed
between
the
two
cases
is
that
the
solution
to
equation
9
generally
involves
a
damped
oscillation
with
period
equal
to
twice
the
refractory
period,
whereas
the
solution
to
equation
10
approaches
the
same
asymp-
totic
value
monotonically.
A
typical
example
is
shown
in
Fig.
3.
We
suggest
that
this
damped
oscillation
is
not
of
great
significance,
for
the
follow-
ing
reasons.
First,
as
the
period
of
the
oscillation
is
dependent
almost
entirely
on
the
length
of
the
absolute
refractory
period,
it
cannot
transmit
information
concerning
the
nature
of
a
stimulus.
Thus,
the
damped
oscillation
is
not
likely
to
have
any
functional
significance.
Second,
although
damped
oscillations
are
often
observed
in
evoked
potential
studies
(Freeman,
1967,
1968
a,
b;
Andersen
and
Eccles,
1962;
MacKay,
1970),
such
oscillations
typically
have
periods
of
40
msec
or
longer,
whereas
an
oscillation
produced
by
absolute
refractoriness
alone
would
be
unlikely
to
have
a
period
of
more
than
about
6
msec.
In
addition,
Freeman's
work
makes
it
reasonably
certain
that
the
oscillations
observed
in
evoked
potential
studies
result
from
interactions
among
excitatory
and
inhibitory
neurons.
Finally,
if
it
is
the
long-
time
behavior
of
a
neural
population
(on
the
order
of
100
msec)
that
is
functionally
significant,
then
the
coarse-grained
equation
10
provides
correct
results.
There
is,
however,
an
apparent
exception
to
the
last
point:
for
certain
parameter
ranges
the
solution
to
equation
9
can
be
shown
to
give
sustained
oscillations.
A
necessary
condition
for
this
is
that
the
summation
constant
a
be
much
smaller
than
the
refractory
period.
This
is
usually
not
the
case,
for
physiological
studies
show
a
to
be
around
4
msec
and
r
around
1-2
msec
(Eccles,
1964).
Furthermore,
we
would
roughly
expect
that
for
equation
6
to
be
valid,
a
would
have
to
be
somewhat
greater
than
r,
for
otherwise
the
exponentially
weighted
integral
would
approach
zero
too
fast
for
significant
temporal
averaging
to
take
place.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
when
a
and
r
are
given
physiologically
reasonable
values,
the
temporally
coarse-grained
equations
are
valid.
PHASE
PLANE
ANALYSIS
Before
proceeding
to
analyze
equations
7
and
8,
one
minor
adjustment
will
be
made
for
conceptual
and
mathematical
convenience.
As
previously
mentioned,
the
state
E
=
0,
I
=
0
will
be
chosen
to
be
the
state
of
low-level
background
activity
so
ubiquitous
in
the
nervous
system.
The
source
of
this
activity
(be
it
spontaneous,
reverberatory,
or
driven)
is
of
no
consequence
to
the
present
investigation.
The
mathematical
consequence
of
this
choice
of
resting
state
is
that
E
=
0,
I
=
0
must
be
a
steady-state
solution
to
equations
7
and
8
for
P(t)
=
Q(t)
=
0,
i.e.,
in
the
absence
of
external
inputs.
Furthermore,
the
resting
state
must
be
stable
to
be
of
physiological
significance.
The
first
of
these
requirements
is
readily
fulfilled
by
transforming
S.
and
Si
so
that
S.(0)
=
3i(O)
=
0.
Given
any
sigmoid
function,
this
may
be
done
by
sub-
tracting
3(0)
from
the
original
function.
Now,
however,
the
maximum
values
of
the

response
functions
will
in
general
be
less
than
unity.
Designating
these
values
by
k,
and
k,
the
refractory
terms
must
be
modified,
giving
the
final
result:
dE
=
-E
+
(ke-r.E)S.(c,E-C21
+
P)1
dt
dI
r
d-t-
-I
+
(ki

E
-
C4
I
+
Q).
(12)
(The
bars
denoting
coarse
graining
have
been
dropped
for
convenience.)
The
equations
may
be
analyzed
qualitatively
using
the
E,
I
phase
plane.
From
the
mathematical
properties
of
sigmoid
functions,
it
is
evident
that
S.
and
Si
have
unique
inverses.
Denoting
these
inverses
by
se-'
and
,-'
it
is
possible
to
write
the
equations
for
the
isoclines
corresponding
to
dE/dt
=
0
and
dI/dt
=
0
as:
c2I
=
ciE
-

P

c
E

C4I
+
i-3'
I
-
Q
for
dI
O
(

ki-rI

Notice
that
c2
and
c3
must
always
be
nonvanishing
for
the
isoclines
to
be
non-
trivial,
thus
making
negative
feedback
between
the
subpopulations
an
essential
feature
of
the
model.
A
typical
plot
of
these
two
equations
for
P
=
0,
Q
=
0
is
shown
in
Fig.
4.
In
this
case
there
are
three
steady-state
solutions
corresponding
to
the
three
intersections
of
the
two
curves.
Depending
on
the
parameter
values
chosen
there
may
be
either
one
or
five
steady
states
instead
of
three,
a
point
to
which
we
shall
return.

Before
going
further,
let
us
choose
a
particular
form
of
sigmoid
function
to
make
matters
more
definite.
The
form
we
shall
choose
is
the
logistic
curve
[shifted
down-
ward
by
a
constant
amount
so
that
S(0)
=
01:
3(x)
l+exp[-a(x-O)]
l+exp(aO)
(15)
Here
a
and
0
are
parameters,
the
latter
giving
the
position
of
maximum
slope
and
the
former
determining
the
value
of
the
maximum
slope
through
the
relationship:
a
max
[8'(x)]
=
S'(0)
=
.
(
16)
No
particular
significance
is
to
be
attached
to
the
choice
of
the
logistic
curve;
any
other
function
with
the
defining
sigmoid
properties
would
be
equally
suitable.
A
different
function
would,
of
course,
lead
to
different
detailed
dynamics,
but
qualita-.
tive
properties
of
the
solutions
such
as
number
and
stability
of
steady
states,
hys-
teresis
effects,
presence
of
limit
cycles,
etc.,
may
be
obtained
from
equations
11
and
12
for
any
particular
function
chosen.
Returning
now
to
our
discussion
of
the
isoclines
defined
by
equations
13
and
14,
we
first
observe
that
the
inverse
of
a
sigmoid
function
is
a
monotonically
increasing
function
of
its
argument
ranging
from
-
co
to
+
co*
Therefore,
E
as
defined
by
equation
14
will
always
be
a
monotonically
increasing
function
of
L
On
the
other
hand,
because
of
the
negative
sign
before
se-'
in
equation
13,
I
will
be
a
generally
decreasing
function
of
E
except
over
a
short
range
where
it
may
temporarily
in-
crease.
This
is
observed
in
the
curve
dE/dt
=
0
in
Fig.
4.
This
qualitative
difference
between
the
two
isoclines
is
a
direct
manifestation
of
the
antisymmetry
between
excitation
and
inhibition.
As
it
is
the
"kink"
in
the
isocine
for
dE/dt
=
0
which
gives
rise
to
the
possibility
of
multiple
steady
states,
hysteresis
phenomena,
and
maintained
oscillations,
it
is
important
to
know
for
what
values
of
the
parameters
this
temporary
reversal
in
the
slope
of
equation
13
can
occur.
A
necessary
and
sufficient
condition
for
this
is
that
the
maximum
slope
of
this
curve
of
I
as
a
function
of
E
be
greater
than
zero.
The
maximum
slope
is
not
easy
to
calculate,
but
a
sufficient
condition
may
be
simply
obtained
by
requiring
that
the
slope
of
equation
13
at
the
inflection
point
of
3*1
be
greater
than
zero.
The
slope
of
the
isocline
at
this
point
is
{Ci
9
VC2
a.
C2}
This
assertion
may
be
proved
through
considerations
of
the
general
shape
of
inverse
sigmoid
func-
tions
and
the
resulting
shapes
of
the
isoclines,
equations
13
and
14.

thus
leading
to
the
condition:
cl
>
91a.
,
(17)
where
a,
is
the
slope
parameter
for
the
excitatory
response
function.
In
obtaining
condition
17
r.
and
ri
have
been
set
equal
to
unity
in
order
to
simplify
the
result.
As
a
matter
of
convenience
we
shall
adopt
this
value
for
r.
and
ri
from
now
on,
as
nothing
essential
is
lost
thereby.
A
physiological
interpretation
of
condition
17
is
possible
once
it
is
realized
that
l/a.
is
directly
related
to
the
variance
of
the
distribution
of
thresholds
or
synaptic
connections
from
which
the
excitatory
subpopulation
response
function
was
derived
(see
equations
1
and
1
a).
That
is,
for
the
maximum
slope
of
the
response
function
(see
equation
16)
to
increase,
it
is
necessary
that
the
variance
of
the
underlying
distribution
decrease.
Thus,
condition
17
implies
that
a
sufficient
condition
for
the
existence
of
multiple
steady
states
is
that
the
average
number
of
synapses
between
excitatory
neurons
must
exceed
a
function
of
the
variance
in
the
distribution
of
these
connections
(or
alternatively,
the
variance
in
the
distribution
of
thresholds).
Assuming
that
condition
17
is
satisfied,
under
what
conditions
will
there
exist
multiple
steady
states?
If
P
and
Q
are
restricted
to
the
value
zero,
this
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer,
for
the
conditions
will
depend
in
complex
ways
on
all
of
the
parameters
of
the
population.
If
P
and
Q
are
not
so
restricted,
however,
then
we
may
state
the
following
theorem.
Theorem
1.
If
cl
>
9/a.,
then
there
is
a
class
of
stimulus
configurations
such
that
the
isoclines
defined
by
equations
13
and
14
will
have
at
least
three
inter-
sections.
That
is,
equations
11
and
12
will
have
at
least
three
steady-state
solutions.
A
stimulus
configuration
is
defined
to
be
any
particular
choice
of
constant
values
for
P
and
Q.
Proof:
The
condition
cl
>
9/a,
is
sufficient
to
insure
that
there
will
be
a
region
in
which
the
isocline
for
dE/dt
=
0
can
be
intersected
at
three
points
by
a
line
parallel
to
the
E-axis
in
the
phase
plane.
As
the
isocline
for
dI/dt
=
0
approaches
asymptotes
parallel
to
the
E-axis,
and
as
the
effect
of
changing
P
and
Q
is
to
trans-
late
their
respective
isoclines
parallel
to
the
I-
and
E-axes
respectively,
one
can
always
choose
values
of
P
and
Q
for
which
there
are
at
least
three
intersections.
Once
the
number
and
locations
of
steady-state
solutions
to
equations
11
and
12
have
been
determined,
the
stability
of
each
steady
state
can
readily
be
determined
by
linearization
around
each
state
and
solution
of
the
resulting
characteristic
equa-
tion.
The
procedure
is
simple
but
tedious,
and
no
real
insight
is
to
be
gained
from
displaying
the
equations.
Accordingly,
we
shall
simply
indicate
stability
charac-
teristics
where
appropriate.

HYSTERESIS
In
the
example
illustrated
in
Fig.
4
two
of
the
three
steady
states
can
be
shown
to
be
stable
and
are
separated
by
an
unstable
state.
This
fact,
plus
the
observation
that
the
effect
of
a
change
in
the
value
of
P
or
Q
is
to
translate
the
appropriate
isocline
parallel
to
one
of
the
phase
plane
axes,
suggests
the
existence
of
hysteresis
phenom-
ena.
(It
will
be
recalled
that
P
and
Q
represent
external
inputs
to
the
excitatory
and
inhibitory
subpopulations.)
This
is
indeed
the
case,
and
a
graph
of
the
hysteresis
loop
obtained
from
Fig.
4
as
P
is
varied
and
Q
held
constant
is
shown
in
Fig.
5.
Only
excitatory
activity
has
been
plotted,
although
a
corresponding
plot
could
be
made
for
the
accompanying
inhibitory
activity.
Had
P
been
held
constant
and
Q
varied
the
resulting
hysteresis
loop
would
have
been
reversed:
excitement
of
in-
hibitory
cells
leads
to
a
decrease
in
excitatory
cell
activity.
The
hysteresis
phenomenon
illustrated
in
Fig.
5
is
a
simple
one,
as
only
two
stable
states
are
involved.
Since
stability
of
two
of
the
three
states
is
easy
to
prove,
a
sufficient
condition
for
the
existence
of
such
a
loop
is
given
by
condition
17.
Simple
hysteresis
loops
have
been
demonstrated
and
discussed
by
Harth
and
coworkers
in
model
neural
populations
containing
mainly
excitatory
cells
(Harth,
et
al.,
1970;
Anninos,
et
al.,
1970).
Consequently,
it
is
not
surprising
that
condition
17
contains
only
parameters
of
the
excitatory
subpopulation
of
the
present
model.
The
presence
of
inhibitory
cells
can
lead
to
more
complex
hysteresis
phenomena.
Two
examples
of
this
are
shown
in
Figs.
6
and
7.
In
the
former
case
two
separated
loops
occur,
while
in
the
latter
three
simultaneous
stable
steady
states
are
observed.
Parameters
may
be
chosen
so
that
the
points
at
which
the
intermediate
stable
state
in
Fig.
7
appears
and
vanishes
bear
any
desired
relation
to
the
bifurcation

for

upper
and
lower
stable
states.
Thus,
as
P
increases
the
intermediate
stable
state
may
vanish
before
the
lowest
state,
etc.
A
sufficient
condition
for
the
existence
of
five
steady
states
may
be
derived
by
examining
the
phase
plane
and
isocines
in
Fig.
8.
Parameters
here
are
those
used
to
obtain
the
double
hysteresis
loop
in
Fig.
7.
It
will
be
seen
that
such
a
configuration
of
isocines
can
only
be
obtained
if
the
minimum
slope
of
the
isocline
for
dE/dt
=
0
is
less
than
the
reciprocal
of
the
maximum
slope
of
the
kink
in
the
isocline
for
dE/dt
=
0.
(The
reciprocal
slope
must
be
taken
in
the
latter
case
because
equation
13
defines
I
as
a
function
of
E.)
A
sufficient
condition
for
this
is
that:

aic3
It
is
obvious
that
condition
18
can
only
be
satisfied
if
a.cl
is
greater
than
9,
so
condi-
tion
17
must
also
be
satisfied.
We
state
this
as
a
second
theorem.
Theorem
2.
Let
the
parameters
of
a
neural
population
satisfy
equation
18.
Then
five
steady
states
will
exist,
though
not
necessarily
concurrently
(see
Fig.
6),
for
some
class
of
stimulus
configurations.
This
is
not
a
sufficient
condition
for
multiple
hysteresis
phenomena,
since
the
intermediate
state
may
be
unstable
in
some
cases.
A
physiological
interpretation
of
condition
18
is
more
apparent
if
it
is
rewritten
as

tion.
Similarly,
the
right
side
of
condition
19
is
a
product
of
factors
measuring
the
strengths
of
interactions
within
the
excitatory
and
inhibitory
subpopulations
respec-
tively.
Thus,
it
may
be
said
that
condition
19
requires
that
there
be
a
relatively
strong
negative
feedback
loop
within
the
neural
population.
In
contrast
to
the
requirements
for
simple
hysteresis,
it
is
evident
from
the
fore-
going
that
multiple
hysteresis
phenomena
are
dependent
upon
the
inclusion
of
inhibition
as
an
essential
part
of
the
present
model.
Although
Smith
and
Davidson
(1962)
and
Griffith
(1963)
did
exhibit
special
cases
in
which
an
intermediate
state
of
activity
was
stabilized
by
inhibition,
we
are
not
aware
of
any
previous
discussion
of
multiple
hysteresis
phenomena
in
model
neural
populations.
Functionally,
hysteresis
was
first
suggested
as
a
physiological
basis
for
short-term
memory
by
Cragg
and
Temperley
(1955).
Such
a
possibility
is
evident,
for
any
input
of
sufficient
intensity
and
duration
will
cause
the
activity
in
the
neural
population
to
jump
from
the
lowest
(resting)
state
into
one
of
the
stable
excited
states,
and
the
activity
will
remain
in
this
state
even
after
the
input
ceases.
It
may
also
be
noted
in
this
context
that
stable
high-level
activity
of
this
type
may
be
interpreted
as
resulting
from
reverberation:
activity
may
circulate
in
the
population
in
such
a
manner
that
the
total
activity
is
constant.
Hysteresis
as
a
form
of
short-term
memory
is
therefore
consistent
with
the
work
of
Hebb
(1949).
In
addition
to
these
conjectures
linking
hysteresis
to
short-term
memory,
there
is
at
least
one
experimental
verification
of
the
existence
of
hysteresis
within
the
central
nervous
system.
This
is
the
work
of
Fender
and
Julesz
(1967),
in
which
it
is
demonstrated
that
hysteresis
is
operative
in
the
fusion
of
binocularly
presented
patterns
to
produce
single
vision.
Since
the
earliest
interactions
between
patterns
presented
to
the
two
eyes
occur
in
area
17,
it
is
clear
that
Fender
and
Julesz
have
demonstrated
the
existence
of
hysteresis
phenomena
in
cortical
tissue.
Our
model
provides
a
neural
interpretation
of
these
results.
It
is
important
to
note
that
hysteresis
has
two
important
forms
of
noise
insensitiv-
ity.
Observe
first
that
in
a
loop
such
as
that
in
Fig.
5
a
large
change
in
P
is
necessary
to
excite
the
population
to
the
higher
stable
state:
there
is
a
population
threshold.
Secondly,
because
of
the
response
time
of
the
population
even
suprathreshold
in-
puts
will
fail
to
alter
the
state
of
the
population
if
they
are
of
insufficient
duration.
To
measure
this
time-intensity
relationship
a
stimulus
of
intensity
P
was
applied
to
an
excitatory
subpopulation
which
was
initially
in
the
resting
state
or
passed
to
a
state
of
maintained
self-excitation.
The
plot
in
Fig.
9
represents
the
time-intensity
threshold
for
the
initiation
of
maintained
activity.
This
curve
is
of
the
Block
type
which
is
commonly
observed
in
the
visual
system
(Le
Grand,
1957).
For
a
noisy
system
such
as
the
brain
subjected
to
a
noisy
environment
these
features
are
of
obvious
significance.
Finally,
let
us
consider
briefly
the
case
in
which
the
excitatory
subpopulation
has
a
bimodal
distribution
of
thresholds
or
connections
and
consequently
a
response
function
such
as
that
shown
in
Fig.
2.
Clearly,
this
response
function
may
give
rise

to
an
isocline
for
dE/dt
=
0
in
which
there
are
two
kinks,
i.e.,
two
regions
of
positive
slope
of
the
isocline
separated
by
a
region
of
negative
slope
(see
equation
13).
This
additional
kink
will
increase
the
number
of
possible
intersections
of
the
two
isoclines
by
two,
one
of
which
will
be
stable.
Therefore,
one
additional
loop
will
be
added
to
the
hysteresis
phenomenon.
In
general,
an
n-modal
excitatory
sub-
population
response
function
will
give
rise
to
complex
hysteresis
phenomena
com-
posed
of
n
simple
hysteresis
loops.
The
existence
of
a
multimodal
distribution
of
thresholds
or
synapses
within
the
excitatory
subpopulation
will,
of
course,
yield
similar
results.
TEMPORAL
PHENOMENA:
LIMIT
CYCLES
So
far
discussion
has
been
limited
to
steady
states,
and
nothing
has
been
said
of
the
transient
behavior
of
the
neural
population.
This
is
because
the
approach
to
a
stable
steady
state
has
been
found
to
be
monotonic
and
uneventful
in
most
cases.
There
are,
however,
two
types
of
temporal
behavior
exhibited
by
our
model
which
are
of
considerable
physiological
interest.
There
are
a
number
of
physiological
systems
which,
in
response
to
impulse
stimu-
lation,
produce
an
average
evoked
potential
in
the
form
of
a
damped
oscillation.
Among
such
systems
are
the
thalamus
(Andersen
and
Eccles,
1962)
and
the
olfactory
bulb
and
cortex
(Freeman,
1967,
1968
a,
b).
Further
examples
are
given
in
MacKay
(1970).
Such
oscillations
typically
show
periods
of
25-40
msec
or
more.
The
usual
interpretation
is
that
the
potential
seen
by
the
recording
electrode
represents
the
net
difference
between
excitatory
and
inhibitory
postsynaptic

tials
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
electrode.
This
suggests
that
the
function
in
our
model
most
closely
related
to
the
average
evoked
potential
would
be
proportional
to
[E(t)
-(t)].
For
an
appropriate
choice
of
parameters,
this
function
will
respond
to
impulse
stimulation
in
a
damped
oscillatory
manner
as
shown
in
Fig.
10.
To
obtain
a
period
similar
to
that
obtained
experimentally,
it
was
necessary
to
choose
the
time
constants
r,
and
T,
to
be
about
10
msec.
This
value
is
in
the
range
for
the
delays
associated
with
the
propagation
of
postsynaptic
potentials
from
the
dendrites
of
a
neuron
to
the
axon
hillock
(Oshima,
1969).
The
ability
of
our
model
to
reproduce
the
general
form
of
the
average
evoked
potential
should
not
be
taken
too
seriously,
as
systems
may
be
readily
designed
to
give
damped
oscillations
in
response
to
brief
stimulation,
and
as
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
reproduce
details
of
the
experimental
curves.
Rather,
we
regard
the
reproduction
of
a
damped
oscillatory
average
evoked
potential
as
a
constraint
to
be
satisfied
by
any
neural
model
claiming
physiological
plausibility.
There
is
a
second
form
of
temporal
behavior
exhibited
by
our
model
which
is
potentially
of
greater
functional
significance:
the
limit
cycle.
Limit
cycles
will
arise
whenever
there
is
only
one
steady
state
determined
by
the
intersection
of
the
isoclines,
and
when
this
steady
state
is
unstable.
As
all
trajectories
must
remain
within
the
unit
square
in
the
phase
plane,
these
conditions
are
necessary
and
suffi-
cient
for
the
existence
of
a
limit
cycle.
Linear
stability
analysis
can
be
used
to
show
that
a
sufficient
(but
not
necessary)
condition
for
the
instability
of
such
a
steady
state
is
that:
cia.
>
c4a1
+
18.
(20)
This
expression
follows
from
the
linear
analysis
plus
the
observation
that
the
re-
quirement
of
a
single
unstable
steady
state
can
only
be
realized
when
the
isoclines
intersect
at
a
point
in
the
vicinity
of
the
inflection
points
of
the
sigmoid
response
functions.
Expression
20
may
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
existence
of
limit
cycles
in
a
neural
population
requires
that
the
interactions
within
the
excitatory
subpopulation
be
significantly
stronger
than
those
within
the
inhibitory
subpopu-
lation.
This
is
reasonable,
since
strong
interactions
within
the
inhibitory
subpopu-
lation
will
tend
to
damp
out
the
negative
feedback
which
is
responsible
for
the
oscillation.
The
requirement
that
there
exist
a
single
stready
state
for
some
choice
of
P
and
Q
and
that
it
occur
for
values
of
E
and
I
near
the
inflection
points
of
the
sigmoid
response
functions
leads

Requirement
21
is
identical
with
condition
18
and
is
derived
in
exactly
the
same
way.
Requirement
22
insures
that
there
is
one
steady
state
rather
than
five.
We
may
there-
fore
state
a
theorem
encompassing
both
limit
cycle
phenomena
and
multiple
hystere-
sis.
Theorem
3.
Let
parameters
be
chosen
so
that
requirement
21
is
satisfied.
Then
if
expression
20
is
not
satisfied,
multiple
hysteresis
phenomena
will
occur
for
some
class
of
stimulus
configurations.
If,
on
the
other
hand,
requirements
20
and
22
are
satisfied,
then
for
some
class
of
stimulus
configurations
limit
cycle
dynamics
will
be
obtained.
The
proof
of
this
theorem
follows
directly
from
a
consideration
of
the
shapes
of
the
isoclines
defined
in
equations
13
and
14
plus
an
enumeration
of
the
possible
ways
in
which
they
can
intersect.
It
is
straightforward
but
tedious
and
will
not
be
reproduced.
Typical
of
the
limit
cycle
activity
found
is
that
shown
in
Figs.
11
a
and
11
b.
As
we
have
required
the
resting
state
E
=
0,
I
=
0
to
be
stable
in
the
absence
of
a
driving
force,
the
neural
population
will
only
exhibit
limit
cycle
activity
in
re-
sponse
to
constant
stimulation.
We
therefore
felt
it
appropriate
to
investigate
the
manner
in
which
the
limit
cycle
depends
on
the
value
of
P
(Q
being
set
equal
to
zero).
Typical
results
are
shown
in
Figs.
12
a
and
12
b.
The
important
observations
are:
(a)
There
is
a
threshold
value
of
P
below
which
limit
cycle
activity
cannot
occur.
(b)
There
is
a
higher
value
of
P
above
which
the
system
saturates
and
limit
cycle
activity
is
extinguished.
(c)
Between
these
two
values
both
the
frequency
of
the
limit
cycle
and
the
average
value
of
E(t)
increase
monotonically
with
increasing
P.
Although
limit
cycle
activity
as
a
result
of
the
constant
stimulation
of
neural
populations
has
not
been
looked
for
experimentally
to
our
knowledge,

do
seem
to
be
directly
related
to
microelectrode
studies.
In
particular,
we
cite
the
work
of
Poggio
and
Viernstein
(1964)
on
thalamic
somatosensory
neurons.
The
constant
stimulation
in
their
study
was
provided
by
a
constant
angle
of
flection
of
the
wrist
joint
of
a
monkey.
When
the
expectation
density
function
of
neurons
driven
by
joint
angle
receptors
was
plotted,
it
was
found
to
be
an
undamped
periodic
function
of
time.
Both
the
average
firing
rate
and
the
frequency
of
the
oscillation
in
the
expectation
density
function
were
found
to
increase
monotonically
with
in-
increasing
(constant)
angle
of
flection
(see
Fig.
9,
Poggio
and
Viernstein,
1964).
Thus,
it
is
seen
that
E(t)
in
our
model
reproduces
qualitatively
the
characteristics
of
averaged
single
unit
firing
patterns
of
certain
thalamic
neurons.
Whether
localized
groups
of
neurons
in
the
thalamus
are
set
into
a
collective
limit
cycle
oscillation
in
response
to
a
constant
stimulus
is
unknown
but
certainly
worthy
of
experimental
investigation.
The
implication
of
both
our
model
study
and
the
work
of
Poggio
and
Viernstein
is
clear:
stimulus
intensity
may
be
coded
into
both
average
spike
frequency
and
the
frequency
of
periodic
variations
in
average
spike
frequency.
How
such
redundancy
in
coding
may
be
used
in
the
nervous
system
is
at
present
unknown,
but
it
is
hoped
that
extensions
of
the
present
model
to
include
spatial
interactions
between
neural
populations
may
lead
to
some
insight
into
the
matter.
Certainly
both
the
existence
of
a
stimulus
threshold
for
initiation
of
limit
cycle
activity
and
the
stability
of
the
limit
cycle
itself
are
important
forms
of
noise
insensitivity.
Limit
cycles
have
also
been
used
as
a
model
for
some
of
the
characteristics
of
electroencephalogram
(EEG)
rhythms
(Dewan,
1964).
In
this
work
the
existence
of
limit
cycle
oscillations
within
the
central
nervous
system
was
assumed
without
independent
evidence.
Our
present
results,
therefore,
provide
a
more
concrete
physiological
basis
for
this
approach
to
the
study
of
EEG
rhythms.
Before
leaving
the
subject
of
limit
cycles
it
may
be
asked
whether
a
neural

lation
which
is
capable
of
limit
cycle
activity
for
a
certain
class
of
stimulus
configura-
tions
will
exhibit
hysteresis
under
different
stimulus
conditions.
The
answer
to
this
may
be
obtained
by
comparing
requirements
20
and
21
with
condition
17.
As
the
minimum
value
of
the
right-hand
side
of
equation
20
is
18,
and
as
the
left-hand
side
of
equation
21
must
be
greater
than
zero,
it
follows
that
whenever
requirements
20
and
21
are
satisfied
condition
17
will
also
be
satisfied.
This
proves
the
following
theorem.
Theorem
4.
Any
neural
population
which
exhibits
limit
cycle
activity
for
some
class
of
stimulus
configurations
will
also
display
simple
hysteresis
phenomena
for
some
other
class
of
stimulus
configurations.6
The
converse
of
this
theorem
is,
of
course,
false.
Also,
the
coexistence
of
limit
cycle
phenomena
and
multiple
hysteresis
is
precluded
by
Theorem
3.
Theorem
4
is
very
strong
in
light
of
the
suggested
functional
significance
of
both
limit
cycles
and
hysteresis.
For
example,
the
theorem
shows
that
nonspecific
biasing
inputs
to
a
neural
population
from
other
parts
of
the
central
nervous
system
may
completely
change
the
character
of
the
response
of
that
population
to
specific
sensory
(or
experimental)
stimulation.
Furthermore,
the
theorem
is
in
principle
testable,
although
this
might
be
difficult
in
practice.
One
probem
is
that
the
experi-
menter
would
need
independent
control
over
the
inputs
to
both
the
excitatory
and
the
inhibitory
subpopulations.
CONCLUSIONS
There
have
been
a
number
of
previous
studies
and
simulations
of
spatially
localized
neural
populations
(Allanson,
1956;
Smith
and
Davidson,
1962;
Griffith,
1963;
ten
Hoopen,
1965;
Anninos
et
al.,
1970).
These
treatments
have,
of
course,
differed
from
each
other
in
various
ways:
some
use
discrete
time,
others
continuous
time,
etc.
In
common
to
all
these
studies,
however,
has
been
the
description
of
the
state
of
the
population
at
time
t
by
a
single
variable:
e.g.,
the
fraction
of
cells
becoming
active
per
unit
time.
This
has
been
true
even
of
those
studies
in
which
a
number
of
connections
have
been
designated
as
inhibitory.
The
most
fundamental
difference
between
this
study
and
previous
work,
therefore,
is
in
the
treatment
of
inhibition
as
arising
from
exclusively
inhibitory
neurons.
It
thus
becomes
necessary
to
deal
with
interactions
between
two
distinct
subpopulations
explicitly,
and
this
requires
the
use
of
the
two
variables
E(t)
and
I(t)
to
characterize
the
state
of
the
population.7
The
assumption
that
the
influence
of
one
neuron
upon
all
others
is
either
ex-
clusively
excitatory
or
exclusively
inhibitory
is
known
as
Dale's
law
(Eccles,
1964).
Although
this
law
is
probably
not
universally
true,
it
is
certainly
true
in
most
in-
It
must
be
remembered
that
a
stimulus
configuration
involves
inputs
to
both
subpopulations.
To
pass
from
limit
cycle
activity
to
hysteresis
it
will
generally
be
necessary
to
change
both
P
and
Q.
I
Anninos
et
al.
(1970)
actually
specify
that
some
neurons
are
inhibitory,
but
they
still
describe
the
state
of
their
population
using
only
one
variable.

stances.
If
one
accepts
the
fact
that
there
are
no
exclusively
excitatory
subsystems
within
the
central
nervous
system,
then
a
two-variable
approach
such
as
ours
is
required
even
in
the
study
of
spatially
localized
populations.
Results
of
our
study
which
follow
directly
from
the
explicit
treatment
of
excita-
tory-inhibitory
interactions
are
the
existence
of
multiple
hysteresis
loops
and
limit
cycles.
(It
will
be
remembered
that
simple
hysteresis
is
dependent
only
upon
char-
acteristics
of
the
excitatory
subpopulation.)
To
these
may
be
added
the
extremely
important
result
in
Theorem
4
stating
that
any
neural
population
exhibiting
limit
cycle
behavior
for
one
class
of
stimuli
will
show
simple
hysteresis
for
some
other
class
of
stimuli.
All
of
these
results
have
been
shown
to
be
of
potential
functional
significance.
A
paper
extending
the
current
model
to
deal
with
spatial
interactions
within
sheets
of
neural
tissue
is
in
preparation
and
will
deal
with
some
of
the
in-
formation
processing
capabilities
resulting
from
the
phenomena
cited
above
(Wilson
and
Cowan,
in
preparation).
Finally,
it
is
to
be
emphasized
that
the
qualitative
results
obtained,
i.e.
simple
and
multiple
hysteresis,
limit
cycles,
and
Theorem
4,
are
independent
of
the
particu-
lar
choice
of
the
logistic
curve
for
the
subpopulation
response
functions.
The
argu-
ments
leading
to
these
results
depend
essentially
only
on
the
general
shapes
of
the
isoclines
as
defined
in
equations
13
and
14.
The
particular
constraints
on
the
param-
eters
given
in
relationships
17-22
will,
of
course,
differ
for
differing
sigmoid
functions,
but
completely
general
relations
may
be
obtained
by
relating
the
connectivity
con-
stants
to
the
maximum
slopes
of
the
response
functions.
This
independence
of
our
model
from
the
particular
choice
of
sigmoid
response
function
is
extremely
impor-
tant,
both
because
of
the
difficulty
in
obtaining
experimental
determinations
of
the
distributions
in
equations
1
and
I
a
and
because
of
the
likelihood
that
these
distribu-
tions
will
differ
in
different
parts
of
the
nervous
system.
APPENDIX
In
this
appendix
we
extend
our
basic
model
to
include
relative
refractoriness.
We
will
deal
only
with
excitatory
cells,
since
an
identical
equation
is
obtained
for
inhibitory
cells.
Further-
more,
we
will
assume
that
the
relative
refractory
period
is
much
longer
than
either
the
absolute
refractory
period
or
the
effective
summation
time.
This
will
permit
us
to
assume
the
results
of
the
temporal
coarse-graining
argument
for
absolute
refractoriness
and
temporal
summa-
tion.
This
latter
assumption
is
for
convenience
only
and
does
not
play
any
essential
part
in
the
derivation.
Finally,
we
assume
that
the
resting
threshold
Oo
is
the
same
for
all
cells
in
the
population.
The
sigmoid
response
function
is
therefore
assumed
to
relate
to
a
distribution
of
synapses
as
shown
by
equation
1
a.
We
assume
that
after
firing
a
cell
is
initially
absolutely
refractory
and
then
relatively
refractory
for
a
time
r,
at
the
end
of
which
it
has
returned
to
its
totally
sensitive
state.
During
the
relative
refractory
period
the
cell
may
of
course
be
fired
by
supernormal
stimulation,
after
which
it
will
again
become
absolutely
refractory,
etc.
We
assume,
therefore,
that
the
relative
refractory
period
can
be
completely
characterized
by
specifying
the
time
course
of
the
return
of
its
threshold
from
an
initially
very
high
value
ultimately
to
its
resting
value
(Adrian,
1928;
Fuortes
and
Mantegazzini,
1962).
Let
the
function
which
describes

return
of
the
threshold
to
its
resting
value
be
called
O(t
-
t'),
where
t'
is
the
time
at
which
the
cell
last
fired.
The
only
restrictions
on
O(t
-
t')
are
that
it
be
continuous
and
that
it
reach
the
resting
value
in
a
finite
time
r.
In
particular,
O(t
-
t')
need
not
be
monotonic,
thus
allowing
for
rebound
depolarization,
etc.
Let
R(t,
t')5t
be
the
proportion
of
those
cells
which
fired
during
the
interval
(t',
t'
+
at)
which
are
still
in
the
relative
refractory
state.
Clearly,
these
cells
will
have
a
threshold
of
O(t
-
t').
If
the
net
excitation
is
designated
by
x(t)
and
the
sigmoid
response
function
for
cells
with
this
threshold
by
S[x(t),
O(t
-
t')]
then
the
equation
which
governs
the
evolution
of
R(t,
t')
wil
be:
d
=
-S[x(t),
O(t
-
t')]R.
(A
1)
dt
This
equation
accounts
for
the
loss
of
cells
from
the
relative
refractory
state
through
refiring.
Equation
A
1
may
be
solved
formally
for
R(t,
t').
As
the
initial
condition
is
that
R(t',
t')
=
E(t'),
the
result
is
R(t,
t')
=
E(t')
exp
{-
S[x(t),
0(t"
-
t')]
dt
}.
(A
2)
Using
this
result,
it
is
evident
that
the
contribution
of
the
firing
of
refractory
cells
to
the
total
activity
in
the
population
at
time
t
is
just:
t
S[x(t),
O(t-t')]R(t,
t-)
dt'.
The
fraction
of
cells
which
have
completely
recovered
from
firing
is:
1
rE(
t)-I
R
(
t,
t')
d
t',
where
the
term
r.E(t)
gives
the
fraction
of
cells
which
have
just
fired
and
are
therefore
ab-
solutely
refractory.
Putting
all
these
results
together
we
arrive
at
the
equation:
T
=
-E
+
f
S[x(t),
O(t
-

dt'
+
[1

s[x(t),
Oo]
(A

where
R(t,

is
given
by
equation
A

This
is
the
equation
for
a
population
of
excitatory
cells
having
both
absolute
and
relative
refractory
periods.
The
second
term
on
the
right
gives
the
contribution
to
E(t)
of
relatively
refractory
cells,
while
the
third
term
gives
the
contribution
of
cells
which
are
totally
sensitive.
Note
that
for
r
=
0,
i.e.
for
a
relative
refrac-
tory
period
of
zero
duration,
equation
A
3
reduces
to
the
same
form
as
equation
7
in
the
text
This
shows
that
equation
A
3
is
indeed
the
proper
extension
of
our
model
to
account
for
relative
refractoriness.
