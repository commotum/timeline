# DynamicCity: Large-Scale 4D Occupancy Generation from Dynamic Scenes (2025)
Source: c24509-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper's primary contribution is a framework for generating large-scale dynamic 4D occupancy scenes, i.e., modeling a higher-dimensional spatiotemporal domain.
- It uses a DiT-based framework for 4D occupancy generation, and DiT is explicitly a transformer-based diffusion model, indicating a transformer adaptation for 4D scene generation.

## Evidence extracts
- "After obtaining HexPlane embeddings, DynamicCity leverages a DiT-based framework for 4D occupancy generation." (p. 4)
- "DiffusionTransformers (DiT) [26] are diffusion-based generative models using transformers to gradually convert Gaussian noise into data samples through denoising steps." (p. 4)
