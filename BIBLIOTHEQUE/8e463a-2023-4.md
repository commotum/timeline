# ALCUNA: Large Language Models Meet New Knowledge (2023)
Source: 8e463a-2023.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces the KnowGen process for constructing artificial entities and uses it to define the ALCUNA benchmark, whose goal is evaluating LLMs on new knowledge understanding, differentiation, and association.
- Grounds its evaluation around ALCUNA, an artificial biological entity knowledge dataset specifically crafted to measure how models respond when confronted with knowledge that did not appear during their training.

## Evidence extracts
- "We propose an approach called KnowGen that generates new knowledge by altering existing entity attributes and relationships, resulting in artificial entities that are distinct from real-world entities. With KnowGen, we introduce a benchmark named ALCUNA to assess LLMs’ abilities in knowledge understanding, differentiation, and association." (Abstract)
- "2) we apply our method to produce an artificial biological entity knowledge dataset, ALCUNA, as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of models in face of new knowledge." (Section 1 Introduction)
