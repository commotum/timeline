          Figure 4: Heatmap visualization of activation profiles across three layers of the MIND model for easy,
          medium, and hard input categories. Each subplot represents a different input complexity, showing how
          activation intensities vary from the first to the third layer. This visualization highlights the model’s capacity to
          increase the depth of processing for more complex inputs while conserving resources for simpler ones.
          Figure 5: Activation patterns across four layers of a standard 4-layer CNN when processing a random input
          image. Each subplot represents the activation map of a layer, illustrating the progressive feature extraction
          from basic textures in the first layer to more abstract representations in deeper layers.
