                                     Using the Ptr-Net model for n = 5, we obtained an accuracy of 80.7% and triangle coverage of
                                     93.0%. For n = 10, the accuracy was 22.6% and the triangle coverage 81.3%. For n = 50, we
                                     did not produce any precisely correct triangulation, but obtained 52.8% triangle coverage. See the

                                     4.4     Travelling Salesman Problem
                                     Weconsidered the planar symmetric travelling salesman problem (TSP), which is NP-hard as the
                                     third problem. Similarly to ﬁnding convex hulls, it also has sequential outputs. Given that the Ptr-
                                     Net implements an O(n2) algorithm, it was unclear if it would have enough capacity to learn a
                                     useful algorithm solely from data.
                                     As discussed in Section 3.3, it is feasible to generate exact solutions for relatively small values
                                     of n to be used as training data. For larger n, due to the importance of TSP, good and efﬁcient
                                     algorithms providing reasonable approximate solutions exist. We used three different algorithms in
                                     our experiments – A1, A2, and A3 (see Section 3.3 for references).
                                     Table 2 shows all of our results on TSP. The number reported is the length of the proposed tour.
