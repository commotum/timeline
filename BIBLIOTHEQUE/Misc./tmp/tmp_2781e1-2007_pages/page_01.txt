                         The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been thought to serve as an ‘executive’ that controls the
                         selection of actions and cognitive functions more generally. However, the mechanistic basis of this
                         executive function has not been clearly speciﬁed often amounting to a homunculus. This paper

                         in motor control and action selection, where the BG provide a ‘Go’ versus ‘NoGo’ modulation of
                         frontal action representations. In our model, the BG modulate working memory representations in
                         prefrontal areas to support more abstract executive functions. We have developed a computational
