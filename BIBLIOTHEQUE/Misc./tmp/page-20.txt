                   Learning program synthesis with self-improving language models: A case study on ARC-AGI
         basic properties like matrix dimensions, then applied a "transduction" strategy to directly map these computed properties to
         hardcoded outputs.
         This hybrid approach presents several issues:
         Impact on Majority Voting: Such solutions can severely compromise our majority weighting strategy. Instead of learning
         generalizable patterns, the model essentially copies and pastes training outputs from the prompt, which skews the voting
         mechanismtowardpotentially incorrect solutions.
         Limited Generalization: The hardcoded conditional structure (as shown in the example) creates brittle solutions that only
         workfor specific input dimensions encountered during training, failing to capture the underlying logical patterns that define
         the ARCtask.
         Detection and Mitigation: Fortunately, these problematic solutions can be easily identified and filtered out by checking
         whether any computed outputs using the solution appear in the code (solution). This simple validation step helps maintain
         the integrity of our inductive learning process.

           You are an AI assistant specialized in solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) tasks by
           reasoning and generating Python code.
           ----- Role: user --------------------
           You are an AI assistant specialized in solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) tasks by
           generating Python code.
           Your goal is to analyze input-output grid pairs. The outputs were produced by applying a
           transformation rule to the inputs. Implement the transformation rules as a Python function.
           You should only write the implemented the transformation in code.
           You must write code in triple backticks (‘‘‘python and then ‘‘‘). You must write a function
           called ‘transform‘ which takes a single argument, the input grid as ‘list[list[int]]‘, and
           returns the transformed grid (also as ‘list[list[int]]‘).
           You should make sure that you implement a version of the transformation which works in general
           (at least for all given input-output pairs and test input pairs).
