develop, from the decoding of the commands to the firing up of
muscles. Central cognition can operate in supervisory control over
these as well, using the products of decoding as well as whatever
the motor system leaves in working memory (as elaborated by other
encoding productions). Central cognition has a chance to issue
new commands, providing mid-course corrections or aborting an
action.

You might wonder why, in terms of this picture, the encoding
productions cannot further elaborate the objects that central cogni-
tion is working on. But the answer is clear, for the productions that
rain down during the elaboration phase are indistinguishable from

encoding and decoding productions. That is, within an elaboration
| phase it is open season, and whatever productions of any kind that
Hl can fire will fire. The essential point is that the decision mechanism
detects the quiescence of the products of cognitive productions as
| the signal to move into the decision phase and ignores the continu-
ing pitter-patter (or torrent) of encoding and decoding.
H The total cognitive system can be viewed either functionally or
| structurally. The top half of Figure 4-16 shows the functional view.
| Init, perception is really P + E. P is the sensory component and E
is the perceptual encoding of it.” The motor system is really D + M.
| D is the decoding and ‘ocal-control component and M is the ac-
{ tuatorg. Then C is a supervisory system. The bottom half of the
| e /o~figuee shows the structural view. Here, P and M are composed of
! unspecified collections of mechanisms, quite different in some ways
at least from the apparatus of cognition—it must transduce energy
to representations, on the one side, and it must take real effortful
actions, on the other, E + C + Dall are similar stuff, productions,
distinguished by their content. The two diagrams group the compo-
nents for the total system quite differently.

The importance of these two alternative views is revealed by an
interesting hypothesis. It is a genuine hypothesis but it cannot yet
be put to the test in Soar, because the total cognitive system is not
yet fully developed operationally. The hypothesis concerns the

9. The temptation is strong to call the P module the senses, but the distinction
between the senses and perception is so complexly grounded that the issues are impossi«
ble to disentangle and labeling as senses versus perception is best avoided. The interface
between Pand E (that is, what P delivers for E-productions to elaborate) is an essentially
open issue at this point in terms of the Soar architecture.
