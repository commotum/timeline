ping and recoding). The construction of chunks must respect the
homogeneity of production conditions and actions. The obvious
scheme would be to construct extra chunks to do the mapping,
but other schemes are possible. Finally, the decision apparatus
must maintain common control, though there is nothing that pre-
vents some of the local production systems from being like
the E-productions of the total cognitive system. What remains con-
stant in all this is an information-processing system that in all of its
subcomponents works as a freely responding recognition memory.
The point is to deny the inference from functional homogeneity to
structural homogeneity.

The second assertion is the chunking-learning hypothesis. All
long-term learning occurs by chunking. The units of learning are
