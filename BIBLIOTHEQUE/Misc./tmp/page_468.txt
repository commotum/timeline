independent of anything concerned with language, such a module
might be indicated for imagery (Kosslyn, 1980). Nothing says that a
system (here Soar) should not have multiple processing modules.
Positive reasons can come from considerations of processing or
from how subsystems were created in the first place.

Fodor (1983, p. 37) characterized modules as systems that are
domain specific, innately specified, hard-wired, autonomous, and
not assembled. Most of these properties are not easily determined
for systems known only through their behavior, such as language.
So in arguing for language to be modular, he refined this list to be:
domain specificity, mandatory operation, fimited central access to
intermediate states, fast operation, informationally encapsulated,
shallow outputs, neural specificity, breakdown specificity, and
fixed ontogeny. One way to explore the relation of Soar to modular-
ity is to ask where the comprehension-operator scheme resides on
these various dimensions. Unfortunately, the list is rather a long
one. For some of the items, in particular the last three, no charac-
terization of Soar seems possible. These seem to have relatively
less weight in any event. For the other six something can be said,
though even here we must be brief. The question is not to what
extent modularity, as delineated by Fodor, characterizes human
mental operations, but what Soar looks like if considered along the
dimensions that characterize modular systems.

On domain specificity, Fodor notes that all language processors
are domain specific in that they process language. This doesn’t help
much, so he points to the eccentricity of the domain (its special
characteristics), to which the processor (the module) becomes
highly tuned. For language, the eccentricity is universal grammar
and the intricacy of current syntactic systems constitutes the tun-
ing. Although, per above, we can't say much about universal gram-
mar, chunking is precisely a system for constructing specific mech-
anisms tuned to the features of an environment. In Soar, the
generality of cognition is not that every situation must be treated
generally, but that generality is always possible when knowledge is
missing (impasses) and that the construction of special-purpose
mechanisms (chunks) works to avoid future breakout.

On mandatory operation, Fodor focuses on the fact that one
must treat received speech as speech—that the option exists of
turning away, but not of hearing it differently (as nonspeech).
Soar’s recognition memory is, of course, also mandatory in the
