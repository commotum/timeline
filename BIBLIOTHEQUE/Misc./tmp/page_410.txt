about the people who have specific properties (namely, those given
by the end terms of the premises). If these are in the model, they
can be read off, but they might not be. Such a failure will be appar-
ent from inspection. Then it may be necessary to augment or mod-
ify an initial model before a conclusion can be constructed. The
source of knowledge for doing this is the premises, so they may
need to be consulted again. If the premises are no longer perceptu-
ally available, some representation of the premises must remain
available in the internal representation. Hence, in addition to a
model of the situation described, it is necessary to have a model of
the premises as well (an utterance model).

These constraints of the task and of annotated models dictate the
qualitative features of sy!logistic reasoning. Reading the premises
leads to the construction of models of both the premises (the utter-
ance model) and the situation they describe (the situation model).
The situation model will not completely capture all the information
available in the premises, either because models lack the necessary
representational scope or because the comprehension process
failed to extract all the available information. If a conclusion cannot
be constructed from direct inspection of the model, more informa-
tion is extracted from the premises until a conclusion can be read
off.

This is enough structure to make contact with the third source of
constraint—the Soar architecture. Mental models are just the states
in problem spaces, and as such they are constructed and manipu-
lated by operators in those problem spaces, but we can go further.
Lack of knowledge leads to an impasse and therefore to recursive
problem solving to resolve the impasse. An incomplete model of the
premises is clearly a situation in which knowledge is lacking. Soar
will then reach an impasse whenever a conclusion cannot be di-
rectly constructed and resort to problem solving in another problem
space to try to resolve that impasse. In this subspace, it should go
back to the premises and try to extract information that can be used
to augment the situation model.

From these constraints we may determine the types of problem
spaces needed to do syllogistic reasoning. There must be a problem
space that can process incoming premises and construct annotated-
model representations of their linguistic structure and of what they
describe. There must be a problem space that can construct a con-
clusion about a situation based on a model of that situation. There
