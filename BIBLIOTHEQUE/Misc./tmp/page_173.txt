1. Problem spaces represent ail tasks
* Problem-solving architecture (no pracess substrate)

2, Productions provide all long-term memory (symbols)
+ Search control, operators, declarative knowledge

3. Attribute/value representation is the medium for all things

4. Preference-based procedure used for afl decisions
» Preference language: accept/reject, better/indifferent/worse

5. Goals (and goal stack) direct all behavior
* Subgoals created automatically from performance-time impasses
» Operators perform the function of deliberate goals

6. Chunking of all goal-results {impasse resalutions) occurs
continuously

result is that the theory gives up the constraint on central symbolic
cognition that these systems could provide. The loss is serious—it
assures that theories will never cover the complete arc from stim-
ulus to response, which is to say, never be able to tell the full story
about any particular behavior.

The reason cognitive psychology does not pay attention to these
mechanisms is neither lack of awareness nor lack of desire. We
all understand, especially when we take an evolutionary perspec-
tive, how intimate is the relation of perception, cognition, and
motor behavior. Cognition no doubt grew out of systems largely
devoted to perceptual-motor activity. Indeed, the view of mind-as-
controller in the second chapter is responsive to such a general
view. The difficulty is that the total system is too complex to handle
all at once, and the sorts of considerations that go into perception
and motor action seem too disparate to integrate. So the strategy is
divide and conquer.

By describing central cognition first, I am committing this same
sin in this section. I will rectify the situation, as least somewhat,
before completing the chapter. But, in fact, the perceptual and
motor systems of Soar are still nascent. This chapter stays as close
as possible to what is firm and actual about Soar.

Figure 4-1 lists the main characteristics of central cognition in
Soar. The rest of Section 4.1 presents the first five of these, which
constitute the architectural structure that permits Soar to perform
