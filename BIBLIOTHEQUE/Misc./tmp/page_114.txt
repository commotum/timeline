large space into larger operators (macro-operators) is a way of shift-
ing knowledge from the test into the generator. Removing operators
known to be irrelevant is another way. Thus organizing the Op-
erators within many small problem spaces is a way of packaging
knowledge for efficient problem solving.

Another important aspect of problem spaces is the condition that
Operators be freely applicable, that is, that a desired state be ac-
ceptable as the solution to the problem, no matter what operators
were used and in what order, as long as they are operators of the
space. Thus, the states preserve a certain set of properties over the
applications of the operators; it is these properties that are guaran-
teed to hold and do not have to be tested by the test for a desired
state. This free-application condition ties directly to the ability of a
system to search for solutions simply and efficiently. If the exact
sequence of operators were important, then the sequences would
have to be monitored, memory devoted to storing the sequence,
and processing devoted to managing that memory—search would
become a complex affair. In these terms, it is easy to see why
operators can have conditions of applicability associated with
