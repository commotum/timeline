                                     Figures 5 as well as Tables 3 and 4 provide additional results for modular multiplication in the
                                     two-set setting.

                                     each averaged over 6 models. Data budget 100M (left) and unlimited (right), training budget 600M. Note: the
                                     bottom right of the left graph correspond to single-set 10M-models: for p = 0.1 and S = 10M, the small and
                                     large set are selected with the same probability.

                                     of models (random initializations) that achieve 50 +% and 90% accuracy for several data budgets and sizes of
                                     the more frequent sets S, and probabilities p. The baseline of single-set traning from Section 3 is given in the
