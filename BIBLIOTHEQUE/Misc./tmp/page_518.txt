506 = Unified Theories of Cognition

attempt to express these other theories in a way that will allow them
to combine with other parts of cognition. As we have noted, the
same explanatory mechanisms can operate with theories or ar-
chitectures that seem quite distinct. What holds for Soar holds for
other unified theories as well. The aim is to bring theories together,
so we should operate cooperatively, not competitively.

(4) Be prepared to modify unified theories of cognition, even
strongly and in radical ways. They are not monolithic, though the
whole does bring constraints to bear that make modification a stir-
ring—even exciting—proposition, and one for the young and ener-
getic. Let me illustrate. We have (circa 1989) essentially completed
the move from Soar4 to SoarS, the latter incorporating the single-
state principle (Chapter 5). This has required substantial reorgani-
zation of the basic structure of Soar—working memory, the pro-
cessing of preferences, the actions of productions—although it
does so in a way that leaves the picture in this book almost un-
changed. Installing it has been like jacking up a house and moving a
new foundation under it. It has taken us a couple of years to make it
happen. The ripples will still be felt for another year—indeed, we
expect the conceptual consequences of this change to become a
ground swell.

The question of the fundamental power of the match (Chapter 5)
provides another illustration, though one that is still in midflight. It
reinforces both the possibility of radical change and the long time
scales involved with extensive investigation and preparation. The
story has several parts. One is a conversation I had during the
William James lectures with Danny Hillis and Dave Waltz of Think-
ing Machines, makers of a massively parallel computer called the
Connection Machine (Hillis, 1985). Was it possible to abandon the
production system entirely and replace it with something like
the memory-based reasoning scheme they have explored on the
Connection Machine, which seems to fit its structure very well
(Stanfilt & Waltz, 1986)? We could identify clearly the role of the
production system in Soar as an associative recognition memory
with a certain modularity for chunking. Maybe, if we just preserved
those two properties, we could wheel out the productions and
wheel in a memory-based reasoning system, thus employing a much
simpler nearest-neighbor match. We explored this path and discov-
ered a number of difficulties (Flynn, 1988). A second part of the
