                         I must have shadows on the way                      The sun was all we had.  Now, in the shade
                         If I am to walk I must have                         All is changed. The mind must dwell on those
                         Each step taken slowly and alone                    White fields, that to its eyes were always old;
                         To have it ready made                               Those ancient gleams, convoluting
                                                                             The way they lay among the huge roots,
                         And I must think in lines of grey                   The great dark tomes of reverie,
                         To have dim thoughts to be my guide                 The plumed labyrinth of the sea.
                         Must look on blue and green
                         And never let my eye forget                         When our own breath gonne faint and fade
                         That color is my friend                             Up the long stairway of the dead
                         And purple must surround me too                     We shall remember well
                                                                             The blindness of the light, the whiteness
                         The yellow of the sun is no more                    Of that white land. The footsteps, and
                         Intrusive than the bluish snow                      The grasses in that light, and in the shade
                         That falls on all of us. I must have                The menacing life.
                         Grey thoughts and blue thoughts walk with me
                         If I am to go away at all.                          We played, too, once, in the warmest rooms.

                         There is a way in the world.                        And wood and town in legend shadowed-
                         That way a man may live in a small town             Once more to return. The one content
                         His lifetime and see no man come,                   Has in it every happiness, more brave
                         Never the stir of men about a market,               For being purposeless; and so
                         Never the bobbing of covered carts,                 Those island gardens, deep in the mind,
                         Never the creak passed on the stair                 Make of remoteness familiarity
                         Closing some other life; an old man                 And of the unspoken name a friend.
                         Can prosper in that town, can prosper
                         When his store is seen to close, his wife           -------- Generated Poem 4 --------
                         Fades in his house, and the world shouts in vain
                         That no one comes to hear him                       Nobody will come to this place.  It is a road that leads nowhere.
                         Where his small bell tolls.                         The solitude is deep.  The mountains are high.
                         In that small town                                  But they are desolate, and they turn the traveler’s face
                         Everything is known.                                Towards the North.  All the sounds of the world are far away.
                         The ways of the young men are known,                When the wind rises above the trees,
                         And the ways of the young women                     The boughs bow to the ground.
                         As they walk to the Spring;                         Even the birds that inhabit the tangle of weeds
                         The rumors are all known,                           That is the roadside cover, are silent. One listens,
                         The quarrels, the hurt, the envy                    But hears no roar of the forest.  One is alone.
                         Of the men and the women.                           One will be taken.
                         Till a day comes                                    One will be taken.
                         That way out of the world                           There is no utterance, there is no conversation,
                         That leads to a wood.                               But one is uneasy all the same....
                         Young, the young man                                There is a thin blue mist,
                         Walks, a lover now,                                 A darkness rising like smoke,
                         Knows the streets as they are and is of them.       And within that darkness
                                                                             A possession of the heart.
                         Comes to the wood.                                  One will be taken....  It was here, and it will be here again-
                                                                             Here, under this sky empty and full of light.
                         There, in the wood, among trees,
                         He sees shadows on the way, hears voices,
                         hears the wind and the rustling of leaves;
                         Through an open glade
                         He sees a shape and the shape hears:
                         It waits as he waits,
                         Waits as the shadows wait,
                         As the voices wait;
                         Shadows on the way, voices in the wind.
