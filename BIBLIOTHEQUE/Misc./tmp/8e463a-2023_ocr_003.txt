as entities, the classes to which they belong, their
attributes and the relations between them. And in-
spired by organisms: organisms can produce organ-
isms with new properties naturally through heredity
and variation. Can knowledge also be "inherited"
and "varied" in a broader context? Different enti-
ties of the same class have different properties as
well as commonalities. Generally speaking, enti-
ties of the same class are similar to some extent,
while they have some different properties. By anal-
ogy with biological terminology, we refer to this
characteristic of knowledge of similar entities as
"hybridizability". This inspires us to use different
entities of the same class to fuse their properties,
simulating the process of biological inheritance and
variation, to generate new entity knowledge.

In the following we will formally define and
describe how knowledge is "inherited" and "varied"
in our approach.

2.2 Knowledge Formalization

Based on the design of the ontology, We repre-
sent knowledge from the viewpoint of Entity. En-
tity e € € is a distinct and identifiable object or
individual in the world. Each entity can possess
various attributes a € A, which describe the prop-
erties of the entity with a value v € V. At the
same time, each entity can participate in relations
r € R with other entities. Both the attributes and
relations of entity e can be represented as a set
of property triplets: {(e,a,v)} = Ta(e) C Ta
and {(e,r,e’)} = Tr(e) C Tr. Entities with
similar characteristics may be aggregated into a
class C Cc €&. For convenience, we denote the
same properties across all entities in class C' as
T(C) = Ta(C) UTR(C). Without any special
description, the triplet T (e) of entity e refers to its
unique properties.

For example, Figure 1 shows an example in the
form of such structured knowledge, where both
Alpaca and Vicuna are existing entities belonging
to the class Camels and Alcuna is an artificial entity
generated by us. Alpaca has attributes such as
"Body mass" and relations such as "Eaten by", and
can be formed into triplets such as (Alpaca, Body
mass, 60kg) and (Alpaca, Eaten by, Cougar).

2.3 Construction of New Entities

Focusing on knowledge in the form of ontology, we
aim to construct artificial entities reasonably to ac-
celerate the process of new knowledge generation
in the real world. When creating an artificial entity

within a specific class, it must adhere to certain
common properties shared by other entities in the
same class. Furthermore, it is essential for the arti-
ficial entity to possess some unique properties that
differentiate it from existing entities. To address
these requirements for individuality and common-
ality, we propose a fast and effective method to
construct an artificial entity that fuses attributes
and relations of entities within the same class.
Initially, we select an existing entity e? from a
specific class C to serve as the parent entity for
our artificial entity € and consider other entities
within the same class C' as sibling entities of par-
ent, denoted by sib(e?) = {e1,...en}. Our goal is
to construct an artificial entity that exhibits high
similarity to the parent entity and conforms to the
commonality of the class (heredity) while incorpo-
rating properties from the sibling entities or reason-
ably changing property values (variation). As an
example, in Figure 1, the artificial entity Alcuna
inherits the "Diet" and other attributes from the
parent Alpaca, while the "Body mass" is varied.
Besides the above operations of heredity and
variation, we construct new entities with additional
extension and dropout of the properties of the new
entities, in order to mimic human progressive cog-
nitive processes of entities. As the example in
Figure 1 shows, we extend the attribute of "First
appearance” from Vicuna to Alcuna, and drop out
the "Life span" from the parent entity Alpaca.
The whole method can be seen in Algorithm 1.
A detailed description of KnowGen with natural
language and expressions is shown in Appendix A.
The entities constructed in this way are not only
reasonable but also convenient for us to assess the
model’s cognitive ability to associate and differen-
tiate new knowledge with the existing knowledge.

2.4 Question Answering as Evaluation Task

Based on the constructed artificial entities, a natural
form of evaluation is to ask questions to LLMs in
the context of new knowledge. In specific, we lever-
age an attribute triplet (é, a, v) for generating a one-
hop question q(é, a, v) by specifically asking about
the object v, given the subject é€ and attribute a.
With a chain of relation triplets To = (é,r, e1) >
(€1,71,€2) > ... > (€n-1,7N-1, EN), We Con-
struct a multi-hop question g(7¢) asking about the
tail object ey, given the head subject é and rela-
tions {r,7r1, ...,7N—1}-

We propose that LLM requires the knowl-
edge understanding, knowledge differentiation and
