PREFACE

The work described in this report was supported as a part of
the internal research program of the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc.
The concepts discussed had their origins in some independent research by
the author in the field of physiological psychology, in which the aim has
been to formulate a brain analogue useful in analysis. This area of
research has been of active interest to the author for five or six years.
The perceptron concept is a recent product of this research programs
the current effort is aimed at establishing the technical and economic

feasibility of the perceptron.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since the advent of electronic computers and modern servo
systems, an increasing amount of attention has been focused on the
feasibility of constructing a device possessing such human-like functions
as perception, recognition, concept formation, and the ability to genera~
lize from experience. In particular, interest has centered on the idea
of a machine which would be capable of conceptualizing inputs impinging
directly from the physical environment of light, sound, temperature, etc.
-- the "phenomenal world" with which we are all familiar -- rather than
requiring the intervention of a human agent to digest and code the

necessary information.

A primary requirement of such a system is that it must
be able to recognize complex patterns of information which are phenomen=
ally similar, or are experientally related -=- a process which corresponds
to the psychological phenomena of "association" and "stimulus generalization",
The system must recognize the "same" object in different orientations, sizes,
colors, or transformations, and against a variety of different backgrounds.
The recognition of "similar" forms can be carried out, to a certain extent,
by analytic procedures on a digital or analog computer, but it is hard to
conceive of a general analytic program which would, for example, recognize
the form of a man seen from any angle, and in any posture or position,
without actually storing a large library of reference figures against
which the percept could be compared. In general, identities of this
sort must be learned, or acquired from experience, and if the system is
to be economical, the number of functional units in the storage system,
or memory, should be much less than the number of forms or memories to
be retained, It is this last requirement which seems to be incompatible
with the nature of conventional computer systems. Moreover, if a memory
with hundreds of thousands or millions of patterns stored in it must be

scanned sequentially in order to identify an object, the time required

-l-


--- Page 04 ---
by conventional systems becomes excessive. The proposed system must
not only economize on storage space: it must be able to categorize
or identify an object "directly" -- i.e., it must locate the relevant

memories without resorting to a sequential search procedure,

Recent theoretical studies by this writer indicate that
it should be feasible to construct an electronic or electromechanical
system which will learn to recognize similarities or identities
between patterns of optical, electrical, or tonal information, in a
manner which may be closely analogous to the perceptual processes of
a biological brain. The proposed system depends on probabilistic
rather than deterministic principles for its operation, and gains its
reliability from the properties of statistical measurements obtained
from large populations of elements, A system which operates according
to these principles will be called a perceptron. A model which is
designed to accept optical, or "visual" patterns as inputs will be
called a photoperceptron. One which accepts tonal patterns, or
"auditory" inputs, will be designated a phonoperceptron, and we might
also consider the possibility of electro= or radioperceptrons, with
corresponding sensory devices, It is also useful to distinguish
between momentary stimulus perceptrons and temporal pattern perceptrons
- the latter having the ability to remember temporal sequencesof events,
rather than transient momentary images, such as would be obtained from

a collection of isolated frames cut from a strip of movie film.

The present discussion will concentrate on a momentary
stimulus photoperceptron, which seems to be the most elementary device
which could be built to demonstrate the general principles of this
type of system. It is suggested that the proposed model should be
built, not only to demonstrate the workability of the perceptron
concept, but as a research tool for further study of the principles
empLloyed.s

II. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF A PHOTOPERCEPTRON

We might consider the perceptron as a black box, with
a TV camera for input, and an alphabetic printer or a set of signal
lights as output. Its performance can then be described as a process
of learning to give the same output signal (or print the same word)
for all optical stimuli which belong to some arbitrarily constituted
class, Such a class might be the set of all two-dimensional trans-
positions of a triangle over the field of view of the TV camera, or
the set of rotational positions of a 3-dimensional form. The forms of
a stimulus pattern which are to be identified as equivalent can each
be represented as a unique set of illuminated points in the TV raster,
All of the "equivalent" forms constitute a transposition set, which we
will call T.

It is possible to teach the system to discriminate two
such generalized forms, or "percepts", by presenting for each form a
random sample from the set of its possible transformations, while
simultaneously "forcing" the system to respond with Output 1 for Form 1,
and Output 2 for Form 2. For example, we might require the perceptron
to learn the concepts "square" and "circle", and to turn on Signal
Light 1 for "square", and Signal Light 2 for "circle", We would then
proceed to show the system a large set of squares of different sizes,
in different locations, while holding Light No. 1 on, thus "forcing"
the response. We would then show a similar set of circles, while
holding Light No. 2 on. If we then show the perceptron any square or
any circle, we would expect it to turn on the appropriate light, with
a high probability of being correct. The penalty that we pay for the
use of statistical principles in the design of the system is a probabi-
lity that we may get a wrong response in any particular case <= i.e.,

a wrong response that is inherent in the nature of the system, rather

-3°


--- Page 06 ---
than due to a malfunction of one of its components. It appears that
this probability may be reduced, however, to a quantity no greater
than the typical probabilities of an error due to malfunctions in

electronic equipment.

The system has three main components, as indicated in
Fige 1:

(1) The S-System (Sensory System) can be represented as a
set of points in a TV raster, or as a set of photocells, Each raster=
point in the S-system is connected to a number of units in the A-system
(Association System), to which impulses are transmitted when the S-point
is "on" (illuminated). Any particular S-A connection may be either
positive (carrying positive or "excitatory" signals to the A-unit) or
negative (tending to inhibit or suppress activity of the A-unit). A
given point in the S-raster, for example, might be positively connected

to ten A-units, and negatively connected to another ten units,

(2) The A-System (Association System) performs the switching
functions between input and output. Each A-unit receives impulses from
a number of S=points, and transmits outputs to one or more Response
Units (R-Units). The A-Units are characterized by the fixed parameter 8,
the threshold value which corresponds to the algebraic sum of input
pulses necessary to evoke an output, and the stochastic variable vs, the
Noutput value", which may be any physically measurable characteristic of
the output pulse, such as amplitude, frequency, or delay-period. The
value of an A-unit's output will vary with its history, and acts as a

counter, or register for the memory~function of the system.

(3) The R-System (Response System) consists typically of a
relatively small number of units, which may operate type-bars or signal
lights, and which are activated when the mean or net value of the signals

received from the A-System exceeds a critical level @,20 In addition to

=


--- Page 07 ---
printing or displaying an output signal, each response unit feeds back
impulses which inhibit, or cut off the activity of all mutually exclusive
Reunits and the A-units which might activate them, These inhibitory feed-=
back connections guarantee that only one response out of a mutually
exclusive set can be triggered at one time. The response circuits are
designed in such a manner that if impulses arrive at two R-units simul-
taneously, the unit whose inputs have the greatest mean (or net) value
will respond first, cutting off the other through its inhibitory connections
before it can be trigcered. An entire set of mutually exclusive R-units
thus acts like a multiestable flip-flop, in which only one stage can be
"on" at any one time. Several such mutually exclusive R-units may exist
in parallel, as, for instance, the ten alphabets necessary to provide

for printing a ten letter word. In such a case, the system is organized

as in Fig. 2, with a distinct A-set corresponding to each Reset.

In Fig. 3, a more detailed breakdown is shown illustrating
the logical composition of a perceptron designed to produce a three-=
binary-digit number as an output. Each binary place in the number is
represented by an R-set of two members, zero and one. In Figure 3,
circles have been used to represent sets of functional units, and
rectangles to represent single units, The figure illustrates the effect
of inhibitory connections when the response "101" is "on", All shaded
areas of the diagram would be under inhibition while this response was
active. Note that the intersection of an active A-set with an inhibited
A-set is not inhibited, i.e., inhibitory connections go from each Reunit

only to those A+subsets which do not contribute connections to it.

The entire organization of a system of this sort can be
represented by a single table, or matrix of connections between units.
The system of Fig. 3, for example, might be represented by a table such
as that of Fige le

Some general principles of organization should be clear
from this table.

(1) The table is organized into three independent sections,
one for every independent set of responses. Each of these sections

consists of an SeA matrix and an A-R matrix.

(2) Within the matrix of S-A connections for each response
set, it is desirable that each column should have a unique permutation
of positive and negative connections,

(3) The numbers of positive and negative connections are the
same in every colum of the matrix.

(hi) Each A-set connects to only one Reset.

(5) Each row of an A-R sub-matrix should have a unique

permutation of connections.

(6) All elements of an A-R sub-matrix which do not represent
excitatory connections are filled in with inhibitory connections from

R to A, provided the A's and R's are of the same set,

Electronic schematics are shown in Fig. 5 for a typical
A-unit and an R-unit which would meet the logical requirements of the
model, The value of the A-unit is controlled by an integrator, which
gains a slight increment every time the unit is active, and which governs
the gain of the output pulse-generator, In such a system, the amplitude
of the output pulse is equivalent to the value, The gas tube in the
input line triggers the A-unit when the value of 9 is exceeded, provided

the gate is not closed by signals from the R-units.

The input network to the R-units may be designed either

the inputs, but an averaging system would be preferable, particularly
if the number of simultaneous inputs expected is small. A voltage is

III. PRINCIPLES OF STIMULUS DISCRIMINATION

In the previous section, we have described the physical
characteristics of the perceptron, without attempting to justify the
prescribed organization. In this section, we will outline the basic
principles on which such a device operates, and introduce some criteria
for evaluating its performance. We will not attempt to derive equations
in this presentation, but the basic equations will be found in Appendix
I, The essence of the perceptron's logic is a stochastic process in the
A-set, whereby the subset of units connecting any particular stimulus
pattern to any particular response gains an increment in its aggregate
value every time that that particular stimulus and response occur
simultaneously. The Association System can be thought of as a number
of overlapping populations of pointgwhose mean values are measured by
the Reunits. Each R-unit measures the mean value of active points in
that particular subset, or class, of points which is connected to it,

If the sets of A-units which transmit impulses to the responses are
large enough, we can be reasonably sure that there will be a non-zero
subset of points transmitting impulses to any particular response for
every stimulus pattern which might be presented,

In a system such as we have described, there will tend
to be a different set of A-units activated by every distinct stimulus
pattern which might occur, If we did not include some proportion of
negative (inhibitory) impulses from the S-points, then a large, complex
pattern would always activate any of the A-units which might be activated
by its component sub-patterns, or by any illuminated area encompassed
within the larger pattern, Under such conditions, the ability to make
independent associations to parts and wholes of complex patterns, or to
discriminate different sizes of illuminated areas would be lost. The
inclusion of inhibitory impulses from the S-points, however, guarantees

that the set of A-units responding to a parti will generally contain

-12.


--- Page 15 ---
some members which will be inhibited when the "whole" is presented, The
sets of A-units activated by two different stimuli, selected at random,
will nonetheless tend to overlap; i.e.; they will contain some proportion

of common elements, P..

It is convenient to use the notation Asor to denote the
subset of A-units which is activated by Stimulus s and which transmits
impulses to Response Unit r. Thus Aa ok means the set of A=-units which
is activated by Stimulus Pattern 1, and which transmits impulses to
Response , Similarly, Ay 304,8,12 means the set of A-units which are
each activated by Stimulus Patterns 1 and 3, and each of which transmits
to the Response Units 4, 8 and 12. This will be a subset of AL ye and
will also be a subset of As As 93 etce. Thus, if we consider a system
with only two responses, and limit ourselves to two unrelated stimulus
patterns, chosen at random, each of which activates 50% of all A-units,

we would expect to find non-zero subsets in the following proportions:

Ala 25% of all A-units
Ana 25% of all A=units
Al 201 12.5%

Al 2 25%

Ayo 25%

Ay 2.2 12.5%

Aa, P 12.5%

Ay 4,2 12.5%

Ay 201,2 6.25% of all A-Units

In this system, the subsets Ay oe1 and AL 2.2 represents the units which
ace ace

-13-


--- Page 16 ---
are common to both stimuli, Po the proportion of those elements
responding to one stimulus which also respond to the second, is

therefore equal to 0.5.

If the stimulus Sy is presented, the subsets Ay 1 and

Alo (including Ay 2.1? Ay 2.2? AD ,2) will be activated and impulses
will be transmitted to both Responses 1 and 2, Since the entire
system is constituted to yield a "flip-flop" effect, however, one or
the other response will prevail, and will suppress the association
sets which do not contribute to its own excitation. Thus, if the

Ay 9 set happens to have a greater mean (or net) value than the set
Ay ? Response No. 2 will become dominant, and Response No. 1 will be
suppressed, This will lead almost immediately to a condition in which
only the subsct Ayo (inelLuding Ay 2.2? Ay 12? and Ay 2.1,2) remains
active, all others being suppressed. For as long as this condition

continues, the elements of this subset will accumulate an increment to

their value, while the elements of the suppressed subsets will remain
unchanged, Thus, the next time the same stimulus (S,) is presented,

that subset of association units (A which is excited by this

1.2)

stimulus and tends to evoke R, will probably have a mean value greater

than that of the association system as a whole, due to its selective

"reinforcement" on the previous presentation. The same response, Ros
will, therefore, have a greater probability of occurring again, The

system has thus learned to associate the stimulus S, to R,, and it

1 2?
will tend to fix that connection more firmly on each successive trial,

If a different stimulus, Sos is then presented, it will
tend to pick up some of the same A-units as Sy -< specifically, those

units in the common set, AY 2.19 and A Hence, part of the value
3 e

1,2.2°
increase which was gained by the set A, 9 will carry over to the set

Ay 93 creating a slight bias towards Response No. 2. Thus, the overlap,
or communality, between the two sets, leads to a statistical interaction

between the associations formed, which may occasionally cause errors in

-1))-


--- Page 17 ---
performance. If the sets responding to different stimuli each represent
a small fraction of the total number of A-units, then the interaction
will be small, and the probability of interference between different
associations will be slight, since the random biases introduced will
tend to cancel one another and can easily be overcome by the value-gain
which is concentrated in the correct subset. Appendix II contains an
illustrative example of the process by which associations are formed,

in a system with 6); A-units.

At this point, we should note that while the communality
between subsets has cost us a penalty of interference between associations,
it has gained something far more important. For if we were to design a
system of, say, 100 A-units, in which sets of 10 units respond to every
stimulus, and if we were to insist that there be no communality between
sets, then we would be limited to a total of only ten stimuli which the
system might distinguish. If, on the other hand, we admit an expected
communality of 10%, the limiting number of stimuli which the system
might identify becomes equal to the number of combinations of 100 things
taken ten at a time -- a total of 1.73 x 10! possible combinations.

This number, however, should not be taken to indicate the practical
capacity of the system, because long before this number of associations
has been learned, the system will have been"saturated", in the sense that
the expected loss of previously acquired associations (through interaction
effects) will exactly balance the expected gain of new associations. As
this equilibrium condition is approached, it will become harder and hard~
er to "teach" the system new associations without knocking out old ones,
and if we try to re-establish the old ones, we will find that we have

lost others in the process.

A more useful criterion for the capacity of the system

is the probability that a stimulus which has been associated to one of

two responses will retain its proper "preference" after the system has

-15-



--- Page 18 ---
been saturated to a given level -- i.e., after some number of associations
has been learned by the system. This probability is formally equivalent
to the probability of establishing a correct discrimination between any
two A-sets on the basis of their mean values, ad will be called P,. The

d
results of some calculations of Pa are presented in Table 1, This table

shows the probability of a correct preference for one of two responses,
in a system which has learned N, associations to each response. The table

has been computed by equation 5, in Appendix I and is subject to the

conditions indicated there, Ny is the number of A-units connected to

each R-unit. The entries in the table represent the normal curve ordinates
of the probability, Pas rather than the probabilities themselves. Thus
with 1000 A-units connected to each R-unit, and a system in which 1% of

the Aeunits respond to stimuli of a given size (iceo, P= o01), the prob-

a
ability of making a correct discrimination with one mit of training, after

10° stimuli have been associated to each response in the system, is equal

to the 2.23 sigma level, or a probability of 0.987 of being correct. In
the table, the communality between A-sets for different responses has been
taken to be zero, i.e., each A-unit transmits to one and only one response
unit. To correct for varying degrees of communality (Po) between the
sets connected to different responses, the figures presented should be
multiplied by 1-Pons and Ny should be divided by the expected number of
output connections per Aeunit. The advantage of overlapping the Resets
(in the manner indicated in Fig, 3) is similar to the advantage of over-
lapping the A-sets for different stimuli; it permits a vast increase in
the number of alternative responses which can be handled, at the cost of
a relatively unimportant degradation in the probability of a correct
response,

From Table 1, the potential efficiency of a system of this
sort can readily be seen. By overlapping the A-sets for different
responses (ices, permitting Por to be greater than zero) a great number

of mutually exclusive responses can be included in any one set, and by


--- Page 19 ---
including several independent sets, words can be built up, or percepts
can be analyzed according to several independent attributes simulta-
neously, A crude estimate indicates that a system with two to three
thousand A-units should be capable of maintaining a vocabulary comparable

to the English language, if connection parameters were properly optimized,

In order to maximize system capacity, and to reduce the
learning process for new objects, it would be desirable to reduce the
set of transformations, T, of a particular stimulus pattern by center-
ing the pattern in the field of view of the input camera. By including
an independent Reset with feedback to a set of camera~aiming servos,
the system can readily be made to train the camera on any forms occur-
ing in peripheral locations in the field, without actually discriminating
the particular forms, For this purpose, it would be necessary only to
learn to distinguish the presence or absence of stimuli in different
locations in the field, associating the presence of a pattern in the
lower left, for example, with a control response moving the camera in
this direction, The system would then be able to "fixate" any pattern
which might prove significant, in much the same mamer as the human eye,
limiting its "recognition learning" to a relatively limited central

field, analogous to the fovea in human vision.

that an equal number of stimuli have been associated to each response,
with a fixed amount of reinforcement for each association formed. An
equation which relaxes these restrictions has not been developed, but
Monte Carlo studies are being planned to investigate the importance of
the assumptions, An additional assumption, for which corrections can

readily be made, is that Ng will be cosiderably greater than 1,

is given by the simultaneous solutions of the following three equations,
subject to the limits indicated. If a set of constraints does not permit
a solution within these limits, this indicates that the constraints are

APPENDIX II

AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE DISCRIMINATION METHOD

Fig. 6 shows a system with 6) A-units, indicating the
particular units (chosen at random) which respond to each of six
stimulus patterns, The 32 units in the left half of each block are
connected to Ry» and the 32 units in the right half of each block are
connected to Re Ry and R,
with zero overlap between their corresponding association sets. When
Ry is active, the Ry 5 is active, the Ry
set is suppressed, Let us consider an experiment in which S55 Soe and
S$, are all to be associated to Ry» while 5) Sys and Se are all to be

3

associated to Rye Thus the active units shown in the left half of the

Sy diagram will each gain one unit of "value" due to the 5, -R, associa-

represent mutually exclusive responses,

set is suppressed, and when R

tion, and, similarly, the active units in the left halves of the So and
53 diagrams will gain a wit of value for each association in which
they participate. The active mits shown on the right side of the
diagrams will gain in value for the Sy Ses and 5¢ associations. After
all six associations have been formed, the value distribution will be

as shown in Fige 7ae If we then superimpose the S, configuration (show

1
by underlining in Fig. 7a) we can add up the net value for the Ry set
and for the Ry set, that would be evoked by such a presentation. We
find a bias of 18 to 6, in favor of Ry; which means that the Ry response

would occur, suppressing R If we add up the bias in the same manner

2°
for each of the other "stimulus patterns", we find that the biases are

as follows:

-25-


--- Page 28 ---
Expected

L "Response
Sy 18 Ry
S, 17 13 Ry
S, 21 1h Ry
S), 12 Ly R,
Se 9 15 R,
Sy, 10 18 Ry

Thus, we see that each of the associations which we tried to form has
actually been established, in spite of the fact that the Ry associations
have added to the value of the Ry subset for all stimulus patterns, and
the Ry associations have similarly added an increment to the Ry subsets
of all stimuli. The expected communality proportion, in this model, is
equal to 5/16, which, together with the small number of A-units, would
cause us to expect rather poor performance from the system. It is
interesting to note that, even under these conditions, all six associa-=
tions have been retained correctly.

To make sure that we have not accidentally selected a
biased set of patterns, which lend themselves to the particular
associations we have considered, let us try reversing each one of the
3 to Ros
the other three stimuli to Ry» by the same procedure that we used
before. In this case, the resulting value distribution is given by

associations, i.¢e, we will now associate Sys Sos and § and

-26-


--- Page 29 ---
Fig. 7b, and the R/R, biases are as follows:

RR, Hebaomss
sy 10 15 Ry
So 11 19 Ry
8, 10 18 Ry
3), Ly. 10 Ry
Sy 14 13 Ry
86 1h 10 Ry

Note that every response has reversed itself correctly, even though

the ratio in the case of Sy is very close.

It has been confirmed by a limited model-sampling study
of transformations of stimuli in a 0x0 raster, with specified connections
to a set of A-units, that anA-unit typically shows a bias to respond to
one type of stimulus pattern more than others, For example, a particular
A-unit might respond to 20% of all possible transpositions of a square,
and perhaps to 1%, or even 0% of the set of transformations of a circle.
A bias of this sort is shown clearly in our model, where the A-unit in
the fifth row and second column is seen to respond to each of the first
three stimuli, and to none of the last three, One way of accounting for
the discrimination phenomenon is to point out that a stimulus from the
transformation set, Tj, is more likely to excite A-units which are
biased towards the set qT, than units which are biased towards some other

set, Tye But the units with a qT, bias will have a corresponding value~

-27-


--- Page 30 ---
bias towards the appropriate response, since they have been "re~
inforced" predominantly by stimuli from the qT set, and relatively
little by conflicting stimuli. Thus, the presentation of a stimulus
to a "saturated" system can be seen as a biased sampling of A-units
which have a stronger linkage to the appropriate response than to

any of the inappropriate ones.

PROPOSAL
YOUR ACTION A PERCEIVING AND RECOGNIZING AUTOMATON
(PROJECT PARA)

I. SUMMARY

Establishment of a new research program at Cornell Aeronautical
Laboratory, Inc. is proposed, with the objective of designing, fabricating,
and evaluating an electronic brain model, the photoperceptron. The proposed
pilot model will be capable of "learning" responses to ordinary visual
patterns, or forms. The system will employ a new theory of memory storage,
(the theory of statistical separability), which permits the recognition of
complex petterns with an efficiency far greater than that attainable by
existing computers, Devices of this sort are expected ultimately to be
capable of concept formation, language translation, collation of military
intelligence, and the solution of problems through inductive logic.

The development and construction of a pilot model is expected
to require the wark of three professional people, a digital computer, and
an associated technical staff for eighteen months,

II, INTRODUCTION

With this proposal, a description of an electronic automaton,
the Cornell Photoperceptron, is submitted. This is the outcome of a
program of theoretical studies on the feasibility of an advanced brain
model, which is to be capable of pattern perception and generalization,
The author's work on the "theory of statistical separability", upon which
the perceptron is based, was begun at Cornell University about five years
ago, and has been continued under the sponsorship of the Systems Research
Department of Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc.
