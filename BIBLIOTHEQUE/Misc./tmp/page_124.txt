Human Cognitive Architecture

3

The basic concepts of intelligent systems—representation, knowl-
edge, symbols, and search—apply as much to machines as to peo-
ple, but human beings, of course, are unique in many ways. The
constraints that shape the human mind, laid out in Figure 1-7, in-
clude some that are quite specific to the human situation: humans
are constricted of neural technology, they are grown embryologi-
cally, they arose through evolution, they must be highly autono-
mous but social. Perhaps even development is specifically
biological.
> Our ultimate goal is a unified theory of human cognition. This will
be expressed, I have maintained, as a theory of the architecture of
human cognition—that is, of the fixed (or slowly varying) structure
that forms the framework for the immediate processes of cognitive
performance and learning. Thus, we need to set out that architec-
ture. We will do so in stages. In this chapter I will attempt to derive
some basic aspects of the human cognitive architecture, attending
only to the way the human is situated in the world. This will lay the
groundwork for proposing in the fourth chapter a specific architec-
ture in detail. (Though, even there, some aspects will remain open.)
As an alternative presentation strategy, the architecture could be
laid out as a total system. This would more closely approximate the
axiomatic ideal. An advantage of a description presented in two
stages, in addition to its possible didactic virtues, is that it separates
what can be claimed about the human cognitive architecture on
general grounds from what must be justified by detailed experimen-
tal data. This is a definite advantage for this book, given that the
specific architecture is only an exemplar.
Thus, this chapter will be devoted to a quite general argument.
As a first given, it will take neural technology to be the technology
