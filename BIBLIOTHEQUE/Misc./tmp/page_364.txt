352 = Unified Theories of Cognition

mature formulation came at the hands of Leo Postman (1961) and
Benton Underwood (Underwood & Schulz, 1960), was of a single
memory. Actually, the emphasis was not on memory at ail, but on
learning. The theory was of a single learning process (stimulus-
response associations), which implied a single memory. The central
explanatory mechanism was that of interference between associa-
tions, either with those that came before (retroactive) or with those
that came after (proactive).

The notion of a distinct short-term memory system emerged in
the mid-fifties (Broadbent, 1954; Miller, 1956). Following almost
immediately came the evidence for a very short-term perceptual
buffer for vision (Sperling, 1960), often called the icon. If a buffer
existed for vision, there should also be one for other sensory modal-
ities, and one was posited almost immediately for audition (the echo
box), although good evidence for it didn't arrive until later (Dar-
win, Turvey, & Crowder, 1972). Each memory was defined by a
collection of distinct phenomena that permitted its inferential
identification. This plethora of memories can be taken as a
sufficient cause for the shift of view from learning to memory,
which occurred in this period. In fact, coincident with it is the
conceptual impact of computers, in which memory plays a striking
and obvious role. The causal arrow runs the other way to some
extent—from the operationalization of memory in computers to
using that conceptual structure to begin the characterization of hu-
man behavior in terms of its memory. In any event, this all coin-
cides with the beginnings of the modern cognitive revolution—and
constitutes psychology’s unique response to it.

Throughout the sixties occurred the elaboration of memory struc-
ture and its functional characterization. The processing sequence
was seen as from sensory buffers to STM to LTM, with information
transferring between the memories. STM was seen as a device for
limiting attention (Broadbent, 1958). It was of small capacity, 7 + 2
chunks, not bits, the latter being at the time the coin of the realm for
measuring information capacity (Miller, 1956). STM decayed rap-
idly, with a half-life of about 7 seconds without rehearsal (Brown,
1958; Peterson & Peterson, 1959}. The code in STM was acoustic
(or articulatory, it was hard to tell which), in contrast with the
physical sensory code in sensory buffers and the semantic code in
LTM (Conrad, 1964). Before the sixties were over, complete math-
ematical models of the memory structure had emerged (Atkinson &
