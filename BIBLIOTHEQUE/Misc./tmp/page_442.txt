Along the Frontiers

We arrive at the last chapter. Where do matters stand on the case
for unified theories of cognition and what they promise for cognitive
science? I have not argued the case abstractly but have chosen to
exhibit a candidate unified theory, Soar. This seemed the only way
to communicate what such a thing would be and how having one
might make a difference. It needs repeating once more. In this book
Tam not proposing Soar as the unified theory of cognition. Soar is,
of course, an interesting candidate. With a number of colleagues, I
am intent on pushing Soar as hard as I can to make it into a viable
unified theory. But my concern here is that cognitive scientists
consider working with some unified theory of cognition. Work with
Act*, with Caps, with Soar, with CUTC, a connectionist unified
theory of cognition.' Just work with some UTC. That is the mes-
sage of this book and the end toward which all its chapters are bent.

To continue restating basics, a unified theory of cognition is by
definition a theory of mind. A theory of mind, however, is not by
definition a theory of the computational and informational pro-
cesses that constitute the mind. The psychological theories that
preceded the cognitive revolution—behaviorism, Gestalt psychol-
ogy, and psychoanalysis—establish the existence of multiple alter-
natives. In addition, a significant amount of current philosophic
discourse seeks to challenge the computational view and to search
for alternatives, although the field is not overloaded with specific
well-developed candidates (see Costall & Still, 1987). The general
presumption of the computational basis of mind is, however, the
basic premise of cognitive science and it is adopted without ques-

1, L was going to propose a connectionist unified theory of everything, but that
seemed a little cute.
