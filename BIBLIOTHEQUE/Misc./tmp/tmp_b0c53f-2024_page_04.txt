                            2.1   Point Cloud-based 3D Object Detection
                            There exist two primary point-cloud representations in 3D object detection, i.e.,
                            point-based and voxel-based ones. In point-based methods [28,29,37,39,55],
                            point clouds are first passed through a point-based backbone network [30], in
                            which the points are gradually sampled and features are learned by point cloud
                            operators. F-Pointnet [29] first employs PoinNet to detect 3D objects based
                            on the frustums lifted by 2D proposals. PointRCNN [37] direct generates 3D
                            proposals from point-based features with foreground segmentation. VoteNet [28]
                            clusters objects from the surface points using a deep Hough voting method.
                            Other point operators based on the point graph [39,55] and the range view [10]
                            have also been developed for point cloud processing.
                               Point-based methods are primarily limited by their inference efÏciency and
                            the absence of contextual features in a continuous space. On the other hand,
                            voxel-based approaches [5,16,18,49,52,58,60] transform the entire point clouds
                            into regular grids through voxelization, showcasing superior efÏciency and con-
                            text representation. VoxelNet [60] proposes a voxel feature encoding (VFE) mod-
                            ule and combines it with 3D convolutions to extract voxel features in an end-to-

                            a significant reduction in both time and memory. PointPillars [18] demonstrates
                            anefÏcient model by stacking voxels into vertical columns, subsequently process-
                            ing them with naive 2D convolutions. There are also efforts [16,35] that explore
                            hybrid representations of point-based and voxel-based networks, demonstrating
                            a better trade-off between speed and accuracy. However, a common limitation
                            across these methods is their reliance on small convolution kernels with restricted
                            receptive fields, making them less adept at capturing the global context for 3D
                            object detection.
                               In this paper, we shed light on the voxel-based methods and introduce a
                            Scattered Linear Attention module that enables dynamic modeling among vox-
                            els within each window with linear complexity, thereby efÏciently extracting
                            window-based contextual features.
                            2.2   Transformer on Point Cloud
                            Inspired by the significant success of self-attention in NLP [46] and CV [7,45],
                            Transformers have been adapted for 3D vision due to their ability to cap-
                            ture long-range dependencies. The Point Transformers [27,57] employ attention
                            to modulate point clouds for classification and segmentation tasks. PCT [12]
                            presents an optimized offset attention module, which, when combined with the
                            implicit Laplacian operator and normal estimation, becomes more adept at
                            point-cloud processing. Some methods like [8,22] opt for voxels or key points
                            to optimize latency. 3DETR [25] proposes a query-based 3D object detection
                            scheme. CT3D [33] enhances the region-based network using a channel-wise
