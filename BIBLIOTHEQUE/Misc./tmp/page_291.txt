Indeed, SRC phenomena are pervasive in all immediate-response
situations.

Our concern here is not with SRC's practical importance but its
use as an example of an immediate-response situation that is some-
what more complex than the SRT and CRT situations analyzed so
far. If we accept the analysis used for the simpler tasks, it should be
possible to analyze SRC phenomena within Soar. That there is
indeed something to be analyzed can be seen in Figure 5-10. Al-
though it might not require explanation why the corresponding case
is least expensive (in time), the issue is not at all clear between the
mixed case and the opposite case.

Until recently the state of the art in SRC research was a body of
much empirical data plus two qualitative propositions: the more
complex the mapping, the more incompatible; and simplicity is
defined by population stereotypes. These permitted intuitive as-
sessment of the comparative compatibility of sufficiently obvious
situations. In 1983, Paul Rosenbloom proposed a quantitative the-
ory of SRC, which was followed up by Bonnie John (John, Rosen-
bloom, & Newell, 1985; John & Newell, 1987). This theory was in
the style of the Model Human Processor (MHP) developed for ap-
plication to human-computer interaction (HCI) by Card, Moran,
and Newell (1983) and described briefly in Chapter 1 (Figures 1-9
and 1-10), The MHP supports a technique for predicting the time to
do a routine cognitive skill by writing an explicit algorithm for the
mental operations that are performed, in a language composed of
Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules (hence called
GOMS analysis). GOMS had been applied to text editing where the
operations take ~10 sec. For the SRC task, the GOMS analysis was
refined to use very rapid internal operators in an explicit algorithm
for doing the mapping from the stimulus to the response. This quan-
