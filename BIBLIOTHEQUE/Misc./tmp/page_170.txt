Human Cognitive Architecture = 157

all these system levels. In fact, almost every aspect of the analysis
has substantial uncertainty associated with it. That is no reason for
not engaging in such speculation. The potential gains are very great,
namely to get some general guidelines for the cognitive architecture
regardless of any specific proposal. Moreover, taken with the right
attitude, such speculation is almost totally benign. An argument has
been laid out. It links together several general aspects of the human
cognitive system. If some facts contravening the conclusion can be
found, that is interesting. They can be taken back through the argu-
ment to find where the argument was wrong. That will be instruc-
tive, because the argument can be taken as the obvious line of
reasoning. Thus, the form of the argument is important and needs to
be shaped up. For instance, one can attempt sensitivity analyses,
such as Figure 3-10, to make it easy to find the sofipots.

In the following chapters such concerns are put aside. Any candi-
date architecture for human cognition must exhibit these character-
istics. The architecture must be a further specification of the outline
sketched here.
