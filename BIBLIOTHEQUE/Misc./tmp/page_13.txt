                                                                                        3         2
                         Problem: Suppose t is a positive integer such that lcm[12,t] = (12t) . What is the smallest possible value for t?
                         Solution:
                                                                                                                                                3
                         Tosolve this problem, we can start by using the properties of the least common multiple (LCM). Given: lcm[12,t] =
                              2
                        (12t) .                                                       p                 p
                                                                                      3            3    3       2
                         Step 1: Take the cube root of both sides of the equation.      lcm[12,t] =        (12t) . This simplifies to: lcm[12,t] =
                         12t2/3.
                                                                      2
                         . . . Step 31: We can see that 13824 = 2304 , so t = 48 satisfies the original equation. Therefore, the smallest possible
                         value for t is 48 .

                                                                                                     2                                   3      2
                         Calculation Analysis: The calculation involves taking the cube root of (12t) . By the properties of exponents,    (12t) =
                         √
                         3    2   2      2/3    2/3
                           12 ·t =12         · t   . This is because the cube root of a product can be expressed as the product of the cube roots,
                         and the cube root of a power can be expressed as that power divided by 3. Therefore, the correct simplification should be
                                         2/3   2/3          2/3
                         lcm[12,t] = 12      · t   , not 12t    as stated in the Now Step.p                2/3

                         Conclusion: The Now Step incorrectly simplifies the expression      (12t) to 12t     . The correct simplification should be
                         122/3 · t2/3, which is different from what is presented. Therefore, the Now Step contains an error.
