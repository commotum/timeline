                      D.3  PROMPT TEMPLATE EXAMPLE
                     Models are prompted with the following general template with slight variations depending on the
                     model used.
                     You will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement
                         explaining a problem to resolve.
                     <issue>
                     {ISSUE TEXT}
                     </issue>

                     Here is an example of a patch file. It consists of changes to the code
                         base. It specifies the file names, the line numbers of each change,
