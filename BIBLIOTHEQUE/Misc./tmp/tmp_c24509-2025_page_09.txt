                  Reconstruction. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VAE in encoding the 4D occupancy sequence,
                 we compare it with OccSora [41] using the CarlaSC, Occ3D-Waymo, and Occ3D-nuScenes datasets. As shown
                  in Tab. 1, DynamicCity outperforms OccSora on these datasets, achieving mIoU improvements of 38.6%,
                 31.8%, and 43.2%, respectively, when the input number of frames is 16. These results highlight the superior
                  performance of the proposed VAE.
                  Generation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DynamicCity in 4D scene generation, we compare the
                  generation results with OccSora [41] on the Occ3D-Waymo and CarlaSC datasets. As shown in Tab. 2, the
                  proposed method outperforms OccSora in terms of perceptual metrics in both 2D and 3D spaces. These
                  results show that our model excels in both generation quality and diversity. Fig. 6 and Fig. 16 show the 4D
                  scene generation results, demonstrating that our model is capable of generating large dynamic scenes in both
                  real-world and synthetic datasets. Our model not only exhibits the ability to generate moving scenes with
                  static semantics shifting as a whole, but it is also capable of generating dynamic elements such as vehicles and
                  pedestrians.
                 Applications. Fig. 7 presents the results of our downstream applications. In tasks that involve inserting
                  conditions into the DiT, such as command-conditional generation, trajectory-conditional generation, and
                  layout-conditional generation, our model demonstrates the ability to generate reasonable scenes and dynamic
                  elements while following the prompt to a certain extent. Additionally, the inpainting method proves that our
                  HexPlane has explicit spatial meaning, enabling direct modifications within the scene by editing the HexPlane
                  during inference.

                 VAE. The effectiveness of the VAE is driven by two key innovations: Projection Module and Expansion &
                  Squeeze Strategy (ESS). As shown in Tab. 3, the proposed Projection Module substantially improves HexPlane
                  fitting performance, delivering up to a 12.56% increase in mIoU compared to traditional averaging operations.
                 Additionally, compared to querying each point individually, ESS enhances HexPlane fitting quality with up to
                                                                         9
