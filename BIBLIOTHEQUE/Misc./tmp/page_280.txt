Immediate Behavior = 267

removes some function from having to be performed between the
stimulus and response, and lets it occur in advance. Generally, such
advancements do not provide alternative decompositions of behav-
ior. The speeded nature of the task and adequate preparation im-
plies that the minimal time arrangement will occur.

Other questions about uniqueness need to be asked. Can the
functions be carried out in different orders (given the Soar architec-
ture)? For example, is D-C-A-M-I-P-T-E possible? The answer is
no. T will always occur in advance. The initial sequence of P-£ is
dictated by the architecture, as is the final sequence of D-M. A
always occurs after P-E, if it has not occurred in advance of the
task. The remaining possibility is C-J versus J-C. But C always has
to precede /, since / terminates the act of cognition on the response.
Thus, since the function of C (comprehension of the input) is neces-
sary, it must be performed before J.

How about variation in how the functions are implemented in
productions and operators? Different kinds of uncertainty must be
distinguished. The first is our scientific uncertainty about the
boundaries between parts of the system. In our present state, we
are unable to determine sharply the boundary between P and E, [
and D, and D and M. We do know, however, that even though we
do not know the actual boundary, it is fixed and does not vary with
task or person.

A second kind of uncertainty is variation depending on the task
and on the properties of the study population. There can be uncer-
tainty between E and C, since they both involve the analysis of the
stimulus. What analysis goes in F and what in C? The key discrimi-
nation is task dependence. The stimulus analysis carried out by E is
totally task independent—E involves automatic encoding and can-
not be augmented or changed for a specific task. All task-dependent
stimulus analysis occurs within cognition. However, what is task
independent can depend on the population. Some populations rec-
ognize the letters of the Hebrew alphabet perceptually; many
others do not.

A third kind of uncertainty is that multiple organizations are pos-
sible, given the types of knowledge of the people performing the
task and the lack of detailed knowledge on the part of people ana-
lyzing the performance (the scientists). For instance, there can be
uncertainty between C and /. Multiple functions must be accom-
plished—verifying the relevance of the stimulus, encoding the
