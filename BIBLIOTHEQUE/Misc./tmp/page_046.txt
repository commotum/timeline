Unified Theories of Cognition = 33

P7. Uncertainty Principte. Decision time 7 increases with uncertainty
about the judgment or decision to be made:

Tele,

where # is the information-theoretic entropy of the decision and te
= 150 [0-157] ms/bit. For 7 equally probable alternatives (called
Hick’s Law),

H = log: (n + 4}.
For n alternatives with different probabilities p,; of occurrence,

H = E)p; loge (1/p; + 1).

P8. Rationality Principle. A person acts so as to attain his goals ~
through rational action, given the structure of the task and his in-
uts of information and bounded by limitations on his knowledge
and processing abitity:

Goals + Task + Operators + Inputs
+ Knowledge + Process-limits > Behavior

P9. Problem Space Principle. The rational activity in which people en-
gage to soive a problem can be described in terms of {1} a set of
states of knowledge, (2} operatars for changing one state into an-
other, (3} canstraints an applying operators, and (4) control knowl-
edge for deciding which operator to apply next.

take longer than another, or how many seconds it would take to
perform a given editing task. Indeed, we wrote chapter II of the
book, which introduced the MHP, in the image of a physics text-
book—as a series of little problems for which it was possible to
calculate the answers.

The MHP is certainly an attempt at a unified theory of cognition,
within the range of behavior elicited by the computer-interaction
situation. In some ways that situation is quite narrow, but in other
ways it is extremely broad, with elements of perception, memory,
decision making, problem solving, motor behavior, and cognitive
skill all occurring in the same task. The MHP is much looser than
