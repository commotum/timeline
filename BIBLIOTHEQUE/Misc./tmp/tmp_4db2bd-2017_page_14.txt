                                      information about global incidence of functions in source code available. For completeness, here we
                                      showplots of raw computation times of each search procedure to solve a given number of problems.
                                      Fig. 5 shows the computation times of DFS, of Enumerative search with a Sort and add scheme, of
                                      the λ2 and Sketch solvers with a Sort and add scheme, and of Beam search, when searching for a
                                      program consistent with input-output examples generated from P = 500 different test programs of
                                      length T = 3. As discussed in Sect. 5.1, these test programs were ensured to be semantically disjoint
                                      from all programs used to train the neural networks, as well as from all programs of shorter length
                                      (as discussed in Sect. 4.2).

                                      The“steps” in the results for Beam search are due to our search strategy, which doubles the size of
                                      the considered beam until reaching the timeout (of 1000 seconds) and thus steps occur whenever
                                                                                 k                         2
                                      the search for a beam of size 2 is ﬁnished. For λ , we observed that no solution for a given set of
                                      allowed functions was ever found after about 5 seconds (on the benchmark machines), but that λ2
                                      continued to search. Hence, we introduced a hard timeout after 6 seconds for all but the last iterations
                                      of our Sort and add scheme.

                                      Asbrieﬂy described in Sect. 4.3, we used the following simple feed-forward architecture encoder:
                                               • For each input-output example in the set generated from a single ground truth program:
                                                      – Padarrays appearing in the inputs and in the output to a maximum length L = 20 with
                                                         a special NULL value.
