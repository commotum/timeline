Intendedly Rational Behavior » 379

the medieval scholars. The terms in a syllogism can be arranged in
four different ways, which are called the four figures, as shown in
the middle of Figure 7-6. Taking all the variations, there are four
forms for first premises times four forms for second premises times
four figures, which yields 64 distinct syllogisms. A conclusion of a
syllogism is a valid inference in one of the four forms that relates
the end terms, A and C. Nine different conclusions are possible for
agiven syllogism, namely, four different forms times two different
orders (AC or CA), plus no valid conclusion (NVC). As shown at
the right of Figure 7-6, the number of valid conclusions for a single
syllogism can vary from none up to four. The NVC response is
correct most of the time (37/64), and only 27/64 of the cases have
some valid conclusion.

The syllogism task sits at the very beginnings of the range of
intendedly rational behavior. A person familiar with syllogistic rea-
soning—for example, someone doing many of them in the course of
an experiment—will take ~ 10 sec, the top of the cognitive band but
hardly an extended task. The time will be substantially longer when
the task is unfamiliar, but then much of the effort is involved in
understanding the task.

The central psychological phenomena concerning syllogisms are
their difficulty and the strong variation in difficulty as a function of
the specific syllogism. Many people, even educated people, do not
get the correct result. Consider the two examples in the figure. Four
groups of 20 peopie tried these two syllogisms in the course of go-
ing through all the 64 different syllogisms (Johnson-Laird, 1983;
Johnson-Laird & Bara, 1984}. Almost everyone got the easy ex-
ample (on the left), 19/20 in each group, but the syllogism on the
right was an entirely different story, 0/20, 2/20, 12/20, and 14/20 for
the four groups.® The first two groups are from an open-admissions
Italian city university and the last two are from a relatively elite
private university in the United States, so there are differences in
the general intellectual level of the two populations even though
both are made up of college students. These central results have
been replicated repeatedly, so there is no doubt that some syllo-

gisms are reliably difficult.
Although it could not be described as ever occupying the main-

6. Both syllogisms were phrased in concrete terms (as the example on the left) rather
than abstract terms (as on the right).
