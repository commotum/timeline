                              Discussion. This example asks for 1 and 0 to be treated as boolean values for the          sharex and
                               sharey arguments of the        pyplot.subplots function. The current code raises an error. In
                              the generated patch, the model adds 1 and 0 as acceptable values. However, the gold patch adds
                              the acceptable values into a list   ["all", "row", "col", "none", False, True] . It also
                              removes the     Integral related warning tied to this issue. This clean up along with the clarity of
                              the   check_in_list argumentmakesthecodemoreconciseandreadable.
