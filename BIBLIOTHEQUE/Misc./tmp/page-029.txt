TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION 563

lines would then be determined by the extent to which the intensity
at any one instant could be permitted to be distorted by the inter-
symbol interference from the light intensities at neighboring times;
that is to say, the frequency-range necessary would depend upon a
blurring in time analogous to the blurring in space which is used to
set the wave-number-range for a single picture. It seems probable
that the total frequency-range required would be somewhat less for
such a system than for one in which flicker is a factor.

CONCLUSION

At the opening of this discussion I proposed to set up a quantitative
measure for comparing the capacities of various systems to transmit
information. This measure has been shown to be the product of the
width of the frequency-range over which steady state alternating
currents are transmitted with sensibly uniform efficiency and the
time during which the system is available. While the most convenient
method of operation does not always make the fullest use of the
frequency-range of the line, as is the case in double side-band trans-
mission, a comparison of the frequency-range actually used with that
which would be required on the basis of the actual information content
of the material transmitted gives an idea of what may be gained in
the cost of lines by making sacrifices in the convenience or cost of
terminal equipment. Finally the point of view developed is useful
in that it provides a ready means of checking whether or not claims
made for the transmission possibilities of a complicated system lie
within the range of physical possibility. To do this we determine,
for each message which the system is said to handle, the necessary
product of frequency-range by time and add together these products
for whatever messages are involved. Similarly for each line we take
the product of its transmission frequency-range by the time it is used
and add together these products. If this sum is less than the corre-
sponding sum for the messages, we may say at once that the system
is inoperative.
