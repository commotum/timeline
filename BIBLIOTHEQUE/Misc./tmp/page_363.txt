Memory, Learning, and Skill = 351

While there is a modicum of intellectual fun to be had in exhib-
iting the twist above, it contains a more serious point. One needs to
have a relatively detailed cognitive architecture in hand to reason
from. In his analysis, Kolers depended on inferences from a highly
generalized view of the nature of production systems. When an
actual architecture is considered, and the task performed with it,
the general inferences may be found to be wide of the mark. The
irony in this is that the explanation that Soar provides is not at
variance with the basic ideas of Kolers. Soar puts procedural learn-
ing at the heart of all learning. It is an instance of exactly the sort of
theory that I believe Paul Kolers wanted. It shows exactly how a
thoroughgoing proceduralism is compatible—indeed, inextricably
linked—with symbols and symbolic systems.

6.6. Short-Term Memory (STM)

So far we have attended exclusively to long-term memory—to see-
ing how Soar, with its uniform recognition memory, provides expla-
nations for all sorts of memory—procedural and declarative, the
latter including episodic and semantic. There is also short-term
memory. In the classical cognitive formulation (from the fifties and
sixties), the major divisions are between long-term memory, short-
term memory, and sensory buffers. Little has been done with Soar
concerning the fatter two types of memory, in part because there is
a strong interaction with perception (especially for the sensory
buffers) and in part because the natural stance in using Soar as an
AI system is to let the working memory last as long as necessary for
the tasks being performed. Nevertheless, Soar must contain im-
plicitly the outlines of a theory of these short-term memory effects.
As an architecture, it is already sufficiently unified to constrain
strongly how such phenomena would show up. As we phrased it
earlier, it must be possible to read out of the Soar architecture a
theory of short-term memory.

Tt is useful to start with a brief history of the conceptual develop-
ment of short-term memory—so brief as to be labeled a nanohis-
tory. Prehistory (prior to the mid-fifties) is a period without a notion
of a distinct short-term memory. There has always been an aware-
ness of short-term memory phenomena, such as the limited im-
mediate memory for digits, called the digit span (Woodworth, 1938;
Woodworth & Schlosberg, 1954). But the received theory, whose
