III. PRINCIPLES OF STIMULUS DISCRIMINATION

In the previous section, we have described the physical
characteristics of the perceptron, without attempting to justify the
prescribed organization. In this section, we will outline the basic
principles on which such a device operates, and introduce some criteria
for evaluating its performance. We will not attempt to derive equations
in this presentation, but the basic equations will be found in Appendix
I, The essence of the perceptron's logic is a stochastic process in the
A-set, whereby the subset of units connecting any particular stimulus
pattern to any particular response gains an increment in its aggregate
value every time that that particular stimulus and response occur
simultaneously. The Association System can be thought of as a number
of overlapping populations of pointgwhose mean values are measured by
the Reunits. Each R-unit measures the mean value of active points in
that particular subset, or class, of points which is connected to it,

If the sets of A-units which transmit impulses to the responses are
large enough, we can be reasonably sure that there will be a non-zero
subset of points transmitting impulses to any particular response for
every stimulus pattern which might be presented,

In a system such as we have described, there will tend
to be a different set of A-units activated by every distinct stimulus
pattern which might occur, If we did not include some proportion of
negative (inhibitory) impulses from the S-points, then a large, complex
pattern would always activate any of the A-units which might be activated
by its component sub-patterns, or by any illuminated area encompassed
within the larger pattern, Under such conditions, the ability to make
independent associations to parts and wholes of complex patterns, or to
discriminate different sizes of illuminated areas would be lost. The
inclusion of inhibitory impulses from the S-points, however, guarantees

that the set of A-units responding to a parti will generally contain

-12.
