I. INTRODUCTION

Since the advent of electronic computers and modern servo
systems, an increasing amount of attention has been focused on the
feasibility of constructing a device possessing such human-like functions
as perception, recognition, concept formation, and the ability to genera~
lize from experience. In particular, interest has centered on the idea
of a machine which would be capable of conceptualizing inputs impinging
directly from the physical environment of light, sound, temperature, etc.
-- the "phenomenal world" with which we are all familiar -- rather than
requiring the intervention of a human agent to digest and code the

necessary information.

A primary requirement of such a system is that it must
be able to recognize complex patterns of information which are phenomen=
ally similar, or are experientally related -=- a process which corresponds
to the psychological phenomena of "association" and "stimulus generalization",
The system must recognize the "same" object in different orientations, sizes,
colors, or transformations, and against a variety of different backgrounds.
The recognition of "similar" forms can be carried out, to a certain extent,
by analytic procedures on a digital or analog computer, but it is hard to
conceive of a general analytic program which would, for example, recognize
the form of a man seen from any angle, and in any posture or position,
without actually storing a large library of reference figures against
which the percept could be compared. In general, identities of this
sort must be learned, or acquired from experience, and if the system is
to be economical, the number of functional units in the storage system,
or memory, should be much less than the number of forms or memories to
be retained, It is this last requirement which seems to be incompatible
with the nature of conventional computer systems. Moreover, if a memory
with hundreds of thousands or millions of patterns stored in it must be

scanned sequentially in order to identify an object, the time required
