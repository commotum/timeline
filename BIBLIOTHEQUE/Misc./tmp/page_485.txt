elaborate (even Ptolemaic) schemes. It should certainly not invent
the concept torque in over-the-board play with a balance beam.'4

Given this overview, we can go through the figure again, this time
focusing on two things—first, how Soar solves the problem of get-
ting the right prediction and the right learning; and second, how
Soar solves the problem of recovering from bad learning. The two
problems intertwine so that the task that Soar performs may not
seem much like development. We will try to disentangle all these
activities at the end, but for now we will deal with the complete
behavior.

Start again at the first (left-hand) trial. Soar gets the task and
doesn't have an operator to do it, so it gets an impasse. This leads
to the G space, in which it attempts to generate an operator. A
prediction operator must encode the particular balance beam, then
compare the encoding of the left side against the encoding of the
right side of the beam, and then use that comparison to select one of
three predictions: down to the left, balance, down to the right. This
set of final, mutually exclusive actions is given by the definition of
the task, and children from age 5 up understand it with a little
instruction and interaction. Likewise, they understand that there is
a comparison of the two arms, although that is less explicitly
spelled out. Rather, the symmetry of the situation and the nature of
the final selection alternatives (down-left, balance, down-right)
would seem to account for the understanding children have of this
aspect of the task. The encoding of the situation, of course, is
simply part of the general way humans deal with their environment.
Thus, the knowledge of encode -> compare — select is built into the
operators of the P space.

The attempt to generate an operator leads Soar down into a com-
parison space (C) to make the comparison of the two sides. The
comparison space actually does the comparison; to get the chunk
requires going into an implementation subspace for it, called CU.
Making some comparison, on this initial trial, is straightforward;
and there is no criteria to guide it other than completing the task.
Once the comparison exists, the problem for Soar is to get it hooked
up to one of the three alternatives, as an appropriate response. In

of course, an initial untaught learning event, but this had the character of scientific
discovery—reflecting, observing, hypothesizing, experimenting.
