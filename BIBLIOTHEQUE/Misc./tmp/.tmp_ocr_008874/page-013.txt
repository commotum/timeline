seen that the maximum number of current values which can be
employed is determined by the maximum power which it is per-
missible to use.

In the case of land line telegraph circuits operated with direct
currents, it is well known that quadruplex circuits are much more
seriously affected by fluctuations and interference than are circuits
employing only two current values. (A quadruplex telegraph circuit
employs four current values for transmission in one direction.) In
general, it may be said that the possibilities of improving ordinary
direct-current operated telegraph circuits in this manner do not
appear particularly promising.

In the case of wireless transmission over great distances all three
of the above factors are important in limiting the number of current
values which can be effectively employed. In the first place, as is well
known, large variations take place in the efficiency of the transmitting
medium so that the received signals vary considerably in magnitude
from time to time. Secondly, the interference, at least at certain
seasons, is great enough to make it difficult to distinguish between
the current values even when the usual method which employs only
two current values is employed. Thirdly, the received power is
limited because of the great attenuation suffered by the wireless
waves.

In the case of carrier transmission, it may be that there will be a
field for the use of more than two current values. The relative
cheapness of the line circuits, however, will tend to limit the amount
by which it will be economical to increase the cost and complexity
of the receiving apparatus. Moreover, it should be borne in mind
that no allowance has been made for the effect on the line speed of
increasing the number of current values, this being considered outside
the scope of the present paper.

Changing an existing network of telegraph circuits so as to employ
a code with three instead of two current values would require new
types of telegraph repeaters as well as new sending and receiving
apparatus, and new operating methods. It is considered to be out-
side of the scope of this paper to go into a discussion of the details of
this matter.

“SINE Wave" SYSTEMS

Considerable interest and discussion has been created by sug-
gestions which have been made to use so-called ‘‘sine wave” systems
of telegraphy. In view of this, a brief discussion of these systems
is given below.
