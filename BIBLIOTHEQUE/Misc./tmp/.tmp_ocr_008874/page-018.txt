CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING TELEGRAPH SPEED 341

It follows at once that, provided

and provided the duration T of the signal is sufficiently short, the
arrival dot is given approximately by the leading term

A") f "H(x)dee

and that this approximation becomes increasingly close as the speed
of signaling is increased, i.e., as the duration T of the dot is decreased.

The conclusions from the foregoing may be stated in the following
propositions:

I. If the speed of signaling is sufficiently high the arrival signal
representing the elementary dot is independent in shape of the form
of the impressed signal, and is proportional in amplitude to the time
integral or ‘area’ of the impressed signal.

It will be evident, however, that if no restrictions are imposed on
A’ (t) and f (#), the foregoing proposition requires, in general, that
the duration T of the dot shall be so small as to make the series expan-
sion rapidly convergent from the start. This, however, requires a
speed of signaling very considerably greater than that actually neces-
sary in practise in order that the foregoing proposition shall hold
to a good degree of approximation, at least for the types of impressed
dot signals specially considered in the present paper. To show this,
it is necessary to establish two less general propositions, valid for
the types of impressed signals under consideration.

Il. If the impressed signal f (¢) is everywhere of the same sign,
then a value 7 exists, such that 0</7/<T/2, and such that

T
S(t-+T/2) =A'(t-+7) i f(x)dx (3)

This proposition follows from the mean value theorem.
III. If f (¢) is everywhere of the same sign, and if further it satisfies
the conditions of symmetry,

f (x) =f (T—x), (wST/2)

then a value + exists, such that 0<7<7/2 and such that
; T
S(t-4T/2) =1/2[A"(t-+7) +41 S(x)dx (4)

This last equation also follows from the mean value theorem. Fur-
thermore, the conditions stated in proposition III are satisfied by
