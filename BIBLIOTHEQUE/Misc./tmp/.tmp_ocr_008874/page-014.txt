CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING TELEGRAPH SPEED 337

A brief analysis of what are the fundamental features of these
systems will be given and, based on the results which have been de-
veloped in the preceding discussion, comparison will be made of these
systems with systems based on other principles. A particular effort
will be made to clear up what appears to be fundamentally incorrect
assumptions which underlie the arguments which have been advanced
in favor of these ‘‘sine wave’ systems.

Crehore-Squier System. The use of a sine wave envelope to im-
prove the characteristics of telegraph signals was advocated by Crehore
and Squier.1. The words ‘United States’ formed by means of a
wave of this type are shown in Fig. 3d. The code employed is the
same as the ordinary Continental Morse, the only difference being
that the signal elements consist of half-cycle sine waves.

In what has preceded, it has been shown that a half-cycle sine
wave has a smaller area than a rectangular wave rounded off by pass-
ing through an electrical network and, consequently, the sine wave
is inferior to the latter from the standpoint of the received signals.
From the standpoint of interference into other circuits, it has also
been pointed out that the half-cycle sine waves contain more high-
frequency components than properly rounded off rectangular waves.
Consequently more interference into other circuits will be produced
with the wave made up of signal elements consisting of half-cycle
sine waves.

Squier System Applied to Submarine Cables. A more recent sug-
gestion of Squier® gives the wave shown in Fig. 3a. This wave
resembles the one advocated by Crehore and Squier in that each
signal element consists of a half-cycle sine wave. As has been pointed
out, there is no advantage gained by this.

The difference between the two systems lies in the fact that the
wave in Fig. 3a uses three absolute values and crosses the axis once
every half cycle. The code is the same as the Continental, a space
being indicated by a half-cycle sine wave of one unit amplitude, a dot
by a half-cycle sine wave of two units amplitude and a dash by a
half-cycle sine wave of three units amplitude.

By referring to the figure, it will be seen that the resulting wave
resembles a continuous sine wave, except for the fact that successive
half cycles differ in magnitude. For this reason, the code may be
termed an “unbroken-reversals’”’ code.

In considering the application of this code to submarine cable
telegraphy, it is convenient to make use of an analysis which is carried
