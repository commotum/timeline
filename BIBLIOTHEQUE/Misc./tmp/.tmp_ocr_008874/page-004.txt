CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING TELEGRAPH SPEED 327

When a telegraph circuit is worked at a line speed as high as will
be permitted by the available frequency range, the shape of the
received signal will be practically independent of the shape of the
transmitted signal, and further, the magnitude of the received signal
will be approximately directly proportional to the area included
within the impressed voltage wave.

The area included within the impressed voltage wave being of
principal importance so far as the wave received at the distant end
is concerned, the areas under the three voltage waves shown in Fig. 1
will next be examined. The areas under waves A and C will be found
to be substantially equal while the area under the wave B is only
about 0.6 as great. Consequently, it should be expected that waves
A and C will be about equally good from the standpoint of the received
signals, while wave B will be poorer, producing received signals only
about 0.6 as great in magnitude. If the maximum voltage (or power)
impressed at the sending end is limited to some given value, the rec-
tangular wave is seen to be the optimum, since this wave has the
maximum area. While the area shown under curve C is approxi-
mately equal to that under the rectangular wave, the effect produced
when a number of signal elements of the same polarity and magni-
tude are sent in succession is such that the maximum voltage trans-
mitted will exceed slightly the corresponding voltage for the case
of the unmodified rectangular wave due to overlapping of adjacent
signal elements.

The above comparison of the three waves of Fig. 1 from the stand-
point of received signals holds not only for signal elements, but also
for complex waves comprising a number of elements. Since for the
speeds under corisideration the received currents for different shapes
of signals applied at the sending end are substantially of the same
form, differing, at most, in magnitude, it follows from the principle of
superposition that any complex signal, whether built up of elements
of one shape or another at the sending end, will produce substantially
the same wave form at the receiving end, the differences in the shapes
of the elements at the sending end producing differences principally
in magnitude of the received waves.

Consideration will next be given to the relative interference which
the different wave forms of Fig. 1 will produce in the frequency range
assigned to other circuits. Since interference into other circuits
results from having the telegraph signal elements contain frequencies
which spread into the ranges assigned to other circuits, it is evident
that the wave will be the best from the standpoint of interference
which contains the least amount of these outside frequencies. By
