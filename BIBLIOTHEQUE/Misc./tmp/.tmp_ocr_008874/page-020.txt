elements per character, then the total number of characters which
can be construed equals m”". In order that two such systems should
be equivalent, the total number of characters that can be distin-
guished should be the same. In other words,
m” =const. (1)
This equation may also be written
n log m=const. (2)

The speed with which intelligence can be transmitted over a circuit
is directly proportional to the line speed and inversely proportional

to the number of signal elements per character provided that the
relations above are satisfied. Hence, we may write

We=s/n (3)

where s is the line speed. Substituting the value of » derived from
the equation above, this equation becomes

w= log m (4)
const.
which may also be written
W=K logm (5)

In applying this formula to practical cases it will be found im-
possible to comply strictly with the condition expressed by equation
(1). As an example, consider the comparison between a_three-
current-value code where each character is made up of three signal
elements, and a two-current-value code where each element is made
up of five signal elements. It is obvious that the speed with which
characters can be transmitted in the former case is five-thirds the
speed in the latter case for a given line speed. In other words the
ratio is 1.67:1 whereas the formula gives the ratio 1.58:1. It should
be noted, however, that the former code possesses only 27 characters
whereas the latter possesses 32. In other words one character of the
latter code represents the transmission of more intelligence than one
character of the former. Thus the figure 1.67 for the relative speeds
of transmission of characters and the figure 1.58 for the relative speeds
of transmission of intelligence are not incompatible.

It will be noted that the formula has been deduced for codes having
characters of uniform duration and that it should not be expected
to be anything but an approximation for codes whose characters are
of non-uniform duration. To establish the formula for the latter
case it would be necessary to make an assumption as to the relative
frequencies of the various characters. It seems reasonable to sup-
