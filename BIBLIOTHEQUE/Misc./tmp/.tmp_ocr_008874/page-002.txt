CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING TELEGRAPH SPEED 325

employing direct currents will next be considered. This will be fol-
lowed by a consideration of the more complicated case of trans-
mission over long submarine cables.

It will be shown that the waves produced by sending rectangular
signal elements through suitable electrical networks which round
them off before they are impressed on the transmitting medium are
probably best in most cases. Comparsion will be made between
waves shaped by sending rectangular signal elements through suitable
networks and waves made up of half cycles of a sine wave, bringing
out the inferiority of the latter.

Direct-CuRRENT TELEGRAPH TRANSMISSION OVER A
DIsTORTIONLESS LINE

Before proceeding with this discussion two terms, which will be
used in this paper, and which are considered to be of fundamental
importance, will be defined—“‘signal element” and ‘‘line speed.” It
is usually possible, especially when sending is done mechanically,
to divide the time into short intervals of approximately equal duration,
such that each is characterized by a definite, not necessarily constant,
voltage impressed at the sending end. The part of the signal which
occupies one such unit of time will be called a “signal element.”
For example, the letter a in ordinary land telegraphy will be said to
be made up of five signal elements, the first constituting a dot, the
second a space and the next three a dash. The “line speed,” as
used in this paper, equals the number of signal elements per second
divided by two. In ordinary land telegraphy the line speed is equal
to the dot frequency when a series of dots separated by unit spaces
is transmitted.

The discussion will first be limited to the case of direct-current
telegraphy over a distortionless line. This case is the simplest, and
in addition the results will aid in understanding the more complex
cases. It may aid in obtaining an understanding of this case to
assume that the distortionless line is made up simply of series and
shunt resistances.

A distortionless line, such as the one which has been assumed,
will transmit all frequencies with equal efficiency from zero upward.
In considering applying direct-current telegraph to this line, it will be
assumed that the telegraph circuit will have assigned to it only a
limited range of frequencies from zero upward, the remaining fre-
quency range being assigned to some other uses, such as ordinary
telephone and carrier telephone and telegraph. It will also be as-
