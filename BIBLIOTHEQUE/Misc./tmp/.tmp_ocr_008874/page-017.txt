the intelligence-carrying component contains no outstanding narrow
range of frequencies to which tuning can be applied should make
obvious the error in this assumption.

The other assumption is that a wave, which is ideal for the trans-
mission of power, is also ideal for the transmission of intelligence.
As a matter of fact, the transmission of intelligence inherently involves
rapid and unpredictable changes in the current, whereas the trans-
mission of power is best brought about by steady current, either
direct or alternating. These two conditions are, of course, incom-
patible.

APPENDIX A

Use has been made of the following two principles:

1. In a telegraph circuit in which the line speed is near the maxi-
mum, the shape of the received dot is substantially independent of
the shape of the impressed dot, and

2. The magnitude of the received current is approximately pro-
portional to the area under the transmitted voltage curve.

The following general discussion of these principles has been fur-
nished by J. R. Carson.

Let the arrival curve, due to suddenly impressed unit battery be
denoted by A (é); then the received signal S (t), due to the elementary
dot impressed signal f (¢) is given by?

S() = i “(x)A"t—x)dx (1)

the upper limit of integration being ¢ for £<T and T for t27. The
latter case will alone be considered since the conclusions arrived at
in this case are conservative.

Expanding A’ (f—<) in (1), we get
