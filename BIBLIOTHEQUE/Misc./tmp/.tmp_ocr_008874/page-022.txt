the spacing between the dots. The result of this is to increase the
number of Fourier components in a given frequency range and to
decrease the magnitude of each. If this process of increasing the
space between the dots is continued indefinitely, we approach the
condition of an isolated dot. Moreover, as we approach this condi-
tion, the number of components in a given frequency range increases
indefinitely and the magnitude of each decreases indefinitely. This
limiting result is known as the Fourier integral for the wave in question.

APPENDIX D

A table has been given in the paper in which the relative efficiency
of various codes in transmitting intelligence is listed. The deriva-
tion of that table will now be given.

The comparison will include the following codes based on two
current values: American Morse, Continental Morse, and the so-
called ‘ideal’? two-current-value code. It will also include the fol-
lowing codes based on three current values: Continental Morse
and an “‘ideal"’ three-current-value code.

The assumption is made that the text is made up of five-letter-
words, no allowance being made for punctuation. The following
table gives the length of the spaces assumed in terms of signal elements.

It is assumed that the dashes in the two-current-value codes are of
three signal elements duration, except for the letter / in American
Morse which is assumed to occupy five signal elements. It may be
that in practice, the dashes are somewhat shorter than has been
assumed but the resulting error is not great. In connection with the
relative spacings between letters and words assumed for the Conti-
nental and American Morse codes, it is also questionable whether
they accord strictly with practise. It may be that these spacings are
on the average more nearly equal than the table indicates. However,
this assumption affects only the relative speeds obtainable with the
American Morse and the Continental Morse and does not materially
affect the comparison between codes based on two current values on
the one hand and codes based on three current values on the other.

The term “ideal” has been applied to two codes which will next
be explained. These codes are constructed on the same principles
