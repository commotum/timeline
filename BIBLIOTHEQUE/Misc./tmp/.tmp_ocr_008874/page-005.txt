making use of a method which is discussed in Appendix C, the fre-
quency components of the three waves illustrated in Fig. 1 have been
computed and are shown in Fig. 2. The frequency marked 1/2 T
in the drawing equals the line speed. T in this connection has the
same value as in Fig. 1. The letters in this figure refer to the corre-

sponding waves in Fig. 1, A being the components of an isolated
rectangular wave, B the corresponding components for the half-cycle
sine wave, and C those for the rectangular wave after it has been
transmitted through the network D in Fig. 1. It is seen from Fig. 2
that the rectangular wave form A contains the greatest amount of
currents of higher frequencies and is, therefore, the poorest from
the standpoint of interference. The half-cycle sine wave contains
less.of these higher frequencies although, as will be seen, the high-
frequency components are far from negligible. The wave C is the
