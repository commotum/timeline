accounts of the sales, then collecting and paying sales taxes. We
want to do all these things vicariously (in our heads), in interaction
and sequence. The more things that are demanded, the tighter are
the constraints on finding some kind of material with the right dy-
namics. Finding feasible representations gets increasingly difficult
with a richer and richer variety of things to be represented and
Ticher and richer kinds of operational transformations that they
undergo. More and more interlocking representation laws need to
be satisfied.

This could simply be the way the world is in fact—a narrower
and narrower eye of the needle through which to thread successful
organisms with higher representational capabilities. That could
have led to a world in which different higher organisms had largely
disjoint representational capabilities. There is more than a little
suggestion of this in the variety of the biological world, with its
plethora of ingenious evolutionary solutions to problems of species
success. The classical story that ethologists have told of the adap-
tive character of lower organisms seems to fit this picture (Tin-
bergen, 1969). Unfortunately, not all adaptations require Tepresen-
tations, and the examples, from the digger wasp to the stickleback,
are not sorted out to make it easy to see exactly what is representa-
tional and what is not.

It might have been this way, but it is not. Instead there exists an
alternative path to obtain highly complex adaptive systems, which
can be called the Great Move, Instead of moving toward more and
more specialized materials with specialized dynamics to support an
increasingly great variety and intricacy of representational de-
mands, an entirely different turn is possible. This is the move to
using a neutral, stable medium that is capable of registering variety
and then composing whatever transformations are needed to satisfy
the requisite representation laws. Far from representational con-
striction, this path opens up the whole world of indefinitely rich
representations.

Figure 2-7 illustrates this path. It should certainly seem familiar,
although its familiarity should not prevent the appreciation of its
significance. The representational medium is a list structure, with
sublists for the stacks of blocks, in order, Starting with the table T,
Let us go around the representation path again. We start with the
encoding of the external situation into a list structure with 7, B, and
A for one stack and 7, C for the other. Movement of the hand is
