titative theory is quite successful at predicting the times humans
take to do an SRC task. Its interest here is that it permits us to show
an important way to proceed with Soar as a unified theory of cogni-
tion—to incorporate another successful theory, rather than replace
it by proposing an entirely new theory.

Let us start with the qualitative structure of the theory. The
mapping of stimulus to response must be done between representa-
tions. There will be a representation of the stimulus situation as it
appears to the person, and this representation must be operated
upon to produce a representation that is now in terms of the output
situation. Thus we get encode — map — respond. The mapping is
done by applying one operator after another. It must occur very
rapidly but it still must be done in a controlled fashion, for the
mapping is determined by instructions for the task and can be
changed at any time. In Soar terms the mapping must be done by
operators (minimal ones to be sure) and not by encoding or decod-
ing productions, which admit no control. Hence the mapping is
serial,

We wish to convert this general theory into Soar terms, which
means that we must specify the mapping algorithm. Figure 5-11
