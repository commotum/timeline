must be problem spaces that can go back to the premises, extract
more information, and refine the situation model,

These problem spaces provide arenas in which task-relevant pro-
cessing can go on. The movement between these spaces depends on
the impasses that occur. The processing that occurs within each of
these spaces depends on the search-control knowledge available.
Some of that knowledge flows directly from the task definition,
such as inspecting the situation models for the end terms. But other
choices may occur where it will not be clear which one of the
possible things to do. In particular, there is no way to avoid putting
together the conclusion part by part. The parts are known because
it must be like a premise, with a subject, an object, a sign, and a
quantifier. But which part should be obtained first? Perhaps it
makes no difference, in which case the choice can be indifferent.
But it might make a difference. The effect might be only how long it
takes to find out the right choice; for example, some parts (say the
sign) can't be determined before others (say the object), so choos-
ing wrong causes a dead end. But the effect might be an error,
because no knowledge exists to tell whether a particular part is
correct or not. (After all this is the process of determining a valid
conclusion; it cannot use knowledge of whether it gets a valid con-
clusion to check whether it is right!)

These effects are the consequences of choosing. The situation
that faces the reasoner is one of multiple choices without the knowl-
edge to select. This implies a Soar tie impasse, but an impasse only
provides the opportunity to seek the knowledge. Given that the
knowledge is actually unavailable, the reasoner is led to another
choice situation but still lacks adequate knowledge to make the
choice. Note that the situation is different from the blocks-world
example in Chapter 4. There, responding to a tie impasse by looking
ahead allowed Soar to contact some solid knowledge about the
desired situation. Here, looking ahead is certainly possible and oc-
curs, but no contact is made with a sure source of knowledge (what
is a valid inference) because no such knowledge exists in the rea-
soner. The question is whether any knowledge could be available to
the reasoner such that accessing that knowledge is better than
choosing indifferently among various open options when they ar-
rive. In fact, there is one plausible heuristic. The conclusion arises
from the premises and thus it must in some general way be deter-
mined by the nature of the premises. It is better, then, to restrict
