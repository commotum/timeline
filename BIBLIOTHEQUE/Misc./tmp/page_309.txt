Typing Speed (gross words per minute)
Figure 5-18. Motor operator versus typing speed (John, 1988).

saw earlier in the analysis of SRC (Figure. 5-11) how those times
correspond to some numbers for Soar (280 ms and 60 ms, respec-
tively), Use of our own parameters would change the results mar-
ginally but would force us to redo the entire analysis for all the
tasks.

We have not posited a time constant for motor operation (D +
M), because, in fact, it isn't constant. People vary in their typing
speed from ~10 to ~100 words per minute. At the slow end, many
additional operations of perception and cognition are involved in
hunting and pecking, making behavior more complex than the
model of Figure 5-17, But as skill increases the simple pipeline
model becomes an increasingly good approximation. Given this
model, changes in typing speed (corresponding to changes in typing
skill) imply changes in the constants of the model, Neither percep-
tion nor cognition are likely candidates for substantial change. This
leaves changes in motor-operation time as the major parameter in
changes in typing speed.

We can use the model to plot the typing speed that arises from
each duration of the motor operation (Figure 5-18). The main use of
this graph is to obtain the motor-operation time for a person whose
typing speed is known, an individual-difference parameter that is
often available. The figure also provides some interesting general
knowledge. Knowing that maximum typing speed is ~120 words/
min, we know that the motor operator never gets faster than
