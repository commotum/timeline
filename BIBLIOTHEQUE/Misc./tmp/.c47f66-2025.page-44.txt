                             GPT-4o (Standard Setting): To determine which option best relates to the poem 'So Mexicans Are Taking
                             Jobs Away From Americans' by Jimmy Santiago Baca, let's analyze the given options in the context of the
                             poem:A.Thegovernmentismakingmarginalizedpeopletheenemy.Thisoptionseemsrelevantasthepoem
                             discusses how the blame is placed on Mexicans for taking jobs, which is instead a reflection of deeper socio-
                             economic issues. The poet points out the misplaced blame and the real struggle of marginalized people. B.
                             The writer uses images from nature in the cold dessert. This option does not appear to be relevant to the
                             poem.Thepoemdoesnotmentionnatureoracolddesert.C.TheMississippiRiverandAbrahamLincolnare
                             mentioned. These specific references do not appear in the poem. Therefore, this option is not relevant. D. The
                             would-be-thief was motivated by blue suede shoes. This option seems to reference another context that is not
                             related to this poem. Reviewing the poem once more confirms that Option A is the most accurate relation to
                             the content of the poem: it highlights how marginalized people are being unfairly blamed. Answer: A
                             GPT-4o (Vision Setting): Question: No. 18: Which of the following options best relates to the poem 'So
                             Mexicans Are Taking Jobs Away From Americans' [Image 1]?Options:(A) The government is making
                             marginalized people the enemy.(B) The writer uses images from nature in the cold dessert.(C) The
                             Mississippi River and Abraham Lincoln are mentioned.(D) The would-be-thief was motivated by blue suede
                             shoes. To solve this question, read the poem carefully. The poem \"So Mexicans Are Taking Jobs from
                             Americans\" by Jimmy Santiago Baca talks about the struggle of Mexican workers and how they are blamed
                             for taking away jobs from Americans. It speaks to issues of marginalization, economic hardship, and systemic
                             injustice. Option A states, \"The government is making marginalized people the enemy.\" This option relates
                             to the overall theme of the poem, as it discusses how Mexican workers are unfairly targeted and blamed for
                             economic problems. Option B is incorrect because it talks about images from nature in a cold desert, which is
                             not relevant to the poem’s content. Option C is incorrect because the Mississippi River and Abraham Lincoln
                             are not mentioned in the poem. Option D is also incorrect because there is no mention of a thief or blue suede
                             shoes in the poem. Answer: A
