                                        1.  PLAIN  KOLMOGOROV  COMPLEXITY
              18
              given any n finds a program generating Vn.  A detailed study of enumerable sets 
              can be found in every textbook on computability theory, for instance, in [184].
                   Proof.  Let us prove the theorem.  First, we need to show that the set 
                                      {(n,x) I X £ Sn} = {{n.x) I C(x) < n},
              where n is a natural number and x is a binary string, is enumerable.
                  Let  D be the optimal decompressor used in the definition of C.  Perform in 
              parallel the computations of D on all the inputs.  (Say, for к = 1, 2,...  we make к 
              steps of D on к first inputs.)  If we find that D halts on some у and returns x, the 
              generating algorithm outputs the pair  (l(y) + l,x).  Indeed, this implies that the 
              complexity of x is less than l(y) + 1, as у is a description of x.  Also it outputs all 
              the pairs (l(y) + 2, x), (l(y) + 3, x) ■ ■ •  in parallel to the printing of other pairs.
                  For those familiar with computability theory, this proof can be compressed to 
              one line:
                                       C(x) < n       3y (l(y) < n A D(y) — x).
              (The set  of pairs  (x, y)  such  that  D(y)  — x  is  enumerable,  being  the  graph  of 
              a  computable  function.  The  operations  of intersection  and  projection  preserve 
              enumerability.)
                  The converse implication is a bit  harder.  Assume that  Vn  is an enumerable 
              family  of finite  sets  of strings  and  | Fn|  <  2n.  Fix  an  algorithm  generating  the 
              set  {(n,x)  I  x £  Кг}.  Consider the description mode Dy  that deals with strings 
              of length n in the following way.  Strings of length n are used as descriptions of 
              strings  in  Vn.  More specifically,  let  xk  be the  fcth string in  Vn  in  the order  the 
              pairs  (n, x)  appear while generating the set  {(n, x) \ x £ Vn}.  (We assume there 
              are no repetitions, so xo, xi, X2, ■ ■ ■ are distinct.)  Let yk be the kth string of length 
              n in lexicographical order.  Then yk is a description of Xk, that is, D(yk) = Xk-  As 
              |V^|  < 2n, every string in Vn gets a description of length n with respect to D.
                  We need to verify that the description mode Dy defined in this way is com­
              putable.  To compute Dy(y), we find the index к of у in the lexicographical ordering 
              of strings of length l{y).  Then we run the algorithm generating pairs  (n,x)  such 
              that x £ Vn and wait until к different pairs having the first component l(y) appear. 
              The second component of the last of them is Dy(y).
                  By construction, for all x £ Vn we have Cdv{x) ^ n.  Comparing Dy with the 
              optimal description mode, we see that there is a constant c such that C(x) < n + c 
              for all x £ Vn.  Theorem 7 is proven.                                                     □
                  The intuitive meaning of Theorem 7 is as follows.  The assertions “the number of 
             strings with a certain property is small”  (is less than 2г) and “all the strings with a 
             certain property are simple”  (have complexity less than i) are equivalent provided 
             the  property  under  consideration  is  enumerable  and  provided  the  complexity  is 
             measured up to an additive constant (and the number of elements is measured up 
             to a multiplicative constant).
                  Theorem 7 can be reformulated as follows.  Let f(x) be a function defined on all 
             binary strings and which takes as values natural numbers and a special value +oo. 
             We call /  upper semicomputable, or enumerable from above, if there is a computable 
             function  (x, к)     F(x, к) defined on all strings x and all natural numbers к such
             that
                                         F(x, 0) ^ F(x, 1) ^ F(x, 2) ^        •
