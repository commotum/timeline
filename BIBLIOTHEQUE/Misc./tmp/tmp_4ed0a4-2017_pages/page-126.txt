                    4.7.  CONDITIONAL PREFIX  COMPLEXITY  AND  COMPLEXITY  OF  PAIRS      111
                For  each  n  consider  the  function  mn(x,y)  which  is  obtained  from  m(x,y) 
            by 2-n-trimming:  the sum  ^ ym(x,7/)  is  forced  to  be  at  most  2~n.  Note that 
            Ylym(,x^y)  — тп(х)  (up  to  O(l)-factors),  so  mn(x,y)  =  m(x,y)  for  n  =  K(x). 
            Then we consider the function
                                   (x,y,z)^  ^2     mn(x,y)mn(x,z)
                                             n^K(x)        2~n
            It is an upper bound since it contains the term with n = K(x).  On the other hand,
                              mn(x, y)mn(x, z)  ^             ^ ymn(x,y)Y2zmn(xiz)

                                                    x  n^K(x)        X
            (As before, we omit the 0(1) terms and factors; they lead only to the 0(1) factor 
            in the final inequality.)
                 114 Show that the inequality of Theorem 26  (p. 48)  is true for prefix com­
            plexity with О(Imprecision:
                            2K(x,y,z) ^ K(x,y) + K(x,z) + K(y,z) + 0(1)
            for all strings x,y,z.
                (Hint:  Add the basic inequality
                                  K(x,y,z) + K(z) ^ K(x, z) + K(y,z) 
            to the inequality K(x, y, z) < K(x, у) + К(z).)
                1115 I Prove that there exists c such that for every string x and for every positive 
            integer n there exists a string у of length n such that
                                        K(x, y) ^ K(x) + n — c.
                (Hint: For every z and n there exists a string у of length n such that K(y \ z) > n.)
                A similar statement can be formulated for n-bit extensions of a given string x 
            (its version for plain complexity makes Problem 46 on p. 42).
                Theorem 71.
                              max{K(xy) \ l(y) = n} ^ K(x\n) + n — 0(1).
                In other words, for some c and all x and n we can append n bits to x in such a 
            way that the complexity becomes at least K(x\n)+n — 0(1) (this is not exactly the 
            increase in the complexity since we compare K(xy) with K(x\n) and not K(x)).
                PROOF.  In terms of a priori probabilities, this inequality says that
                               2n min{m(xy) \ l(y) = n} ^ m{x \ n) ■ 0(1).
            The  left-hand  side  does  not  exceed  ^~2{m(xy)  \  l(y)  =  n}  (the  sum  may  only 
            decrease if we replace all summands by the least one).  But the latter sum is (as a 
            function of x and n) a lower semicomputable semimeasure, so it remains for us to 
            compare it with the maximal semimeasure m{x\n).                               □
                I  116 I Show that a bit weaker statement with K(x) — K(n) instead of K(x \ n) 
            (in the right-hand side) can be derived from the statement of Problem 115.
