                                           5.7.  THE  RANDOM  NUMBER П                              167
             section we try to understand this phenomenon providing a direct proof for it (and 
             as a byproduct we improve the results of this section).
                  5.7.6.       The Solovay property as a property of the sum.  First, let us note 
             that  the  Solovay  property  is  invariant  under  computable  permutations.  Indeed, 
             consider some computable permutation 7r.  It changes the a priori probability only 
             by a constant  factor:  m(r(i))  =  0(т(г)).  Then let us consider grouping.  Since 
             we want to allow infinite groups,  let  us consider  a computable series          j aij  °f 
             non-negative rational numbers.  Then
                      a =      aij = (aoo + ctoi + •••) + (aio + сщ + -- -) + ''' =       ^г,
                            i,j                                                         i
             where Ai =        a^.
                  We want to show that Ai and          are slowly converging series (in the Solovay 
             sense)  at the same time.  Note that slow convergence is permutation-invariant, so 
             it  is well defined for two-dimensional series.
                  However,  some clarifications  and  restrictions  are  needed.  First,  J^Ai  is not 
             in general a computable series, it is only a lower semicomputable one.  We extend 
             the  definition  of the  Solovay  property  to  lower  semicomputable  series:  for  such 
             a series we still have Ai  =  0(m(i)),  and we require this bound to be 0(l)-tight 
             infinitely  often.  Second,  such  a general  statement  is  not  true:  imagine  that  all 
             non-negative terms are in the first group Ao  and  all Ai,A2,...  are zeros.  Then 
                Ai does not have the Solovay property while ^  aij could have it.  The following 
             result  (essentially from [67]) provides the needed restrictions:
                  Theorem  112.  Assume that each group Ai  contains only finitely many non­
             zero terms.  Then the properties Ai/m(i) —> 0 and aij/m(i,j) —>• 0 are equivalent.
                  Here m(i,j) is the a priori probability of pair (i,j)  (its number in some com­
             putable numbering; the probability does not depend on the coding up to an 0(1)- 
             factor).  The convergence means that for every e > 0, the inequality а^/т(г, j) > e 
             is true only for finitely many pairs (г, j).
                  P roof.  Let us recall first that m(i) = J2j m(hj) up to a 0(l)-factor.  (Indeed, 
             the sum in the right-hand side is lower semicomputable,  so it  is  0(m(i))  due to 
             maximality;  on  the  other  hand,  already  the  first  term  т(г,0)  is  £l(m(i)).)  So 
             if aij/m(i,j)  tends to  zero,  the ratio  A i/J2jm(i,j)  does the same  (only finitely 
             many pairs have aij > em(i,j) and they appear only in finitely many groups).
                  It is more difficult to show that Ail mi —>• 0 implies aij/m(i,j) —> 0.  (Here we 
             need to use that only finitely many terms in each group are non-zero.)  For this it is 
             enough to construct some lower semicomputable rh(i,j) such that aij/ih(i,j) —> 0, 
             somehow using the fact that Ai/m(i) —> 0.  The natural idea would be to split m(i) 
             between m(i,j) in the same proportion as Ai is split between a^.  However, for this 
             we need to compute Ai (and not only to lower semicompute it).  It would be easy if 
             we knew how many terms among ецо, an,... are non-zero, but in general this is a 
             non-computable information.  (For the special case of finite grouping this argument 
             indeed works.)
                  So we use another approach.  For some constant c we may let m(i,j) be ca^- 
             while this does not violate the property J^j ^ ih j) ^ m{i).  (As m(i) increases, we 
             let m(i,j) increase when possible.)  If indeed Ai/m(i) —>• 0, for every constant c we
