          486             2.  FOUR  ALGORITHMIC  FACES  OF  RANDOMNESS
          Note also that
           (5)                    A{k-l) = A0{k)UAl{k).
              If i(k)  = ап(^)  (i.e.,  the kth guess was correct),  Player’s capital increases ac­
          cording to the formula
          (6)               V{k) = V(k - 1) + v{k) • ß{Ai(k){k))
          This  formula guarantees  that  the  game  is  fair,  i.e.,  the  expected  change  of the 
          capital  at  the  fcth  step  equals  zero.  However,  an  unpleasant  surprise  is  possible 
          when we apply this rule:  the value р(Ацкфк)) in the denominator may be equal 
          to 0.  In this case (which was not possible for the uniform distribution nor for any 
          positive  distribution  where  all  balls  have  positive  measures)  a special  additional 
          stopping rule is used.
              Additional stopping rule.  This is used when it happens (for the first time) 
          that p,(A(k)) — 0 (cf. equation (2) above).  Assume that p(A(k — 1)) ф 0, p(A(k)) — 
          0.  The last move made was the kth move, when Player made a prediction i(k).  If 
          the prediction turns out to be correct (i.e., i(k) = an^), then the game is stopped 
          and Player’s capital  is  declared to  be infinite  V(k)  =  +oo,  and Player wins  the 
          game.  If the prediction turns to be incorrect, i.e.,  i(k) ф an(/ф  then the game is 
          also stopped, but in this case the capital of Player remains unchanged (and fixed), 
          so Player does not win the game.
              This rule takes care of the problem of a zero denominator in (6).  Indeed,  (6) 
          is applied only if i(k) = an(ky  In this case А^кфк) = A(k), according to (3).  So if 
          we get a zero denominator, it means that p(A(k)) = 0.  But in this case we apply 
          the additional stopping rule instead of (6).  (Or we could say that we apply (6) and 
          declare that we get +oo when dividing positive number ß{Ai_i^(k)) by zero.)
              The definitions of a strategy, a computable strategy, a strategy that performs 
          only valid moves remain (up to these changes) the same as for the special case of 
          the uniform distribution.
