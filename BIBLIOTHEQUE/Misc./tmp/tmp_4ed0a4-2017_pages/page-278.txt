                      9.3.  MISES-CHURCH  RANDOMNESS  265
          {Hint-.  This problems differs from the preceding theorem, because now we take 
        into account only ^-aligned blocks.  However, the same argument works.)
          The sequences where each combination of letters (of every fixed size) has the 
       same limit frequency (as claimed by Theorem 168), were considered independently 
        of Mises; they are called normal
          255 Let us change the definition of normality of a bit sequence a and require
       that  for  every  m  the sequence  of m-bit  strings,  obtained  by  splitting  a  into  m- 
       bit  blocks,  contains every m-bit string with limit frequency 2~m.  Prove that this 
       definition is equivalent to the original one.
          {Hint:  The difference is that now we consider only aligned m-bit occurrences 
       instead of all occurrences.  Still we can prove equivalence considering not only m-bit 
       blocks but also M-bit blocks where M is a large multiple of m.  Assume that aligned 
       M-bit blocks appear with right frequencies.  Then for a fixed position inside each 
       long M-bit block (modulo M) all short m-bit blocks appear with right frequencies, 
       and short blocks that cross the boundaries between large blocks are rare (m <C M). 
       In  the other direction,  assume that  non-aligned frequencies are OK.  Most  M-bit 
       blocks are good in the sense that frequencies of short blocks inside them are almost 
       right.  Bad blocks are exponentially (in M) rare in terms of non-aligned frequencies. 
       Aligned frequencies could be at most M times bigger, and the factor M is absorbed 
       by the exponent.)
          The reals whose binary representations are normal sequences, are called normal 
       in base 2; similarly one can define reals that are normal in base b.  If a real is normal 
       in base b for every integer b, it is called absolutely normal
          256 Prove that the same reals are normal in base b and in base bk.
          (Hint:  Use the preceding problem.)
          One can prove that the class of normal in base b reals depends on b, but this is 
       a non-trivial number-theoretic result [161], and we will not prove it here.
          257  Let  us  consider  a bit  sequence ш  as a binary  representation of a real
       a G [0,1].  The tails of oj form a sequence of points in [0,1] which is the orbit of a 
       under the mapping x (->■ {2x} where {u} stands for the fractional part of u.  Show 
       that oj is normal if and only if this orbit is uniformly distributed in  [0,1].  (The 
       latter means that for every interval the fraction of points that are in this interval 
       has a limit proportional to the length of the interval.)
          258  Prove that multiplication by an integer factor preserves normality:  If a
       is normal in base 2 and к is an integer, then ak is normal in base 2.  (The same is 
       true for other bases.)
          {Hint:  Use the preceding problem.  Applying the nth iteration of the mapping 
       x и  {2x} to some real u, we get {2nu}.  For every integer к the number {2n{ku)} 
       is obtained from {2nu} by the transformation у i-> {ky}.  It remains to prove that 
       this mapping preserves the uniform distribution property.)
          One can prove that normality is also preserved when we divide a number by 
       some integer (and therefore, when we multiply a number by an arbitrary rational 
       number).  This was shown by D. Wall [218]  (see also  [88]), but the proof is non­
       trivial and we do not provide it here; see [182] for the proof.
          We know that Mises-Church random sequences are normal, but one can also 
       find a computable normal sequence.  For example, if we write numbers 1, 2,3,... in
