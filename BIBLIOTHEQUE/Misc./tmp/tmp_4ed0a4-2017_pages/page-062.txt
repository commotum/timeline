                                              2.3.   COMPLEXITY  AS  THE  AMOUNT  OF  INFORMATION                                                         47
                           Now we move to triples of strings instead of pairs.  Here we have an important 
                    tool that can be called relativization:  most of the results proved for unconditional 
                    complexities remain valid for conditional complexities (and proofs remain valid with 
                    minimal changes).  Let us give some example of this type.
                           A theorem about the complexity of pairs (p. 31) says that
                                                     C(x, y) < C(x) + 2 log C(x) + C{y) + 0(1).
                    Replacing all complexities by conditional ones  (with the same condition z  in  all 
                    cases), we get the following inequality:
                                             C(x,y\z) ^ C(x\z) + 2\ogC(x\z) + C(y\z) + 0(1).
                    By conditional complexity of a pair x,y relative to z we mean, as one can expect, 
                    the  conditional  complexity of its  encoding:  C(x,y\z) = C([x,y\\z).  As for  un­
                    conditional  complexity,  the choice of encoding is  not  important  (the  complexity 
                    changes by 0(1)).
                           The proof of this relativized inequality repeats the proof of the unrelativized 
                    one:  we combine the description p for x (with condition z) and the description q for 
                    y (with condition z) into a string pq that is a description of \p, q]  (with condition z) 
                    relative to some suitable conditional decompressor.
                           This is nothing really new.  However, we may express all the conditional com­
                    plexities in terms of unconditional ones:  recall that C(x,y\z) = C(x,y,z) — C(z) 
                    and C(x\z) — C(x, z) — C(z), C(y\z) — C(y, z) — C(z) (with logarithmic precision). 
                    Then we get the following theorem:
                           Theorem 24.
                                                 C(x. y, z) + C(z) < C(x, z) + C(y. z) + O(logn) 
                    for all strings x, y: z  of complexity at most n.
                           Sometimes this inequality is called the basic inequality for complexities.
                           The same relativization  can  be  applied  to  Theorem  21  (p.  37)  that  relates 
                    the  complexity of a pair and  conditional complexity.  Then we get the following 
                    statement:
                           Theorem 25.
                                                     C(x,y\z) = C(x\z) + C(y\x,z) + O(logn) 
                    for all strings x, y, z  of complexity at most n.
                           PROOF.  We can follow the proof of Theorem 21, replacing unconditional de­
                    scriptions by conditional ones  (with  г  as  the condition).  Doing this,  we replace 
                    C(y\x) by C(y Ix, z).  One can say that now we work in three-dimensional space 
                    with coordinates x,y,z and apply the same arguments simultaneously in all planes 
                    parallel to the xy plane.
                           If this argument does not look convincing, there is a more formal one.  Express 
                    all the conditional complexities in terms of unconditional ones:
                                                                C(x, y\z) = C{x, y, z) - C{z),
                    and for the right-hand side
                                       C(x\z) + C(y\x,z) = C(x,z) — C(z) + C(y,x,z) — C(x,z).
                    We see that both sides coincide (up to O(logn)).  (A careful reader may note that 
                    this simplified argument gives larger hidden constants in 0(logn)-notation.)                                                          □
