             176                          5.  MONOTONE COMPLEXITY
                 {Hint:  If such a cover exists for some a, for a greater o' the same intervals have 
             smaller measure,  and the decrease is more significant  for smaller intervals.  Note 
             that we can delete all short strings from the cover,  due to our assumption  (each 
             element is covered infinitely many times).)
                 We return to the notion of effective Hausdorff dimension in Section 9.5 where 
             its relation to effective martingales is explained.  We show there how to translate 
             the proof of Theorem 120 into the martingale language.
                        5.9.  Randomness with respect to diifferent measures
                 5.9.1.  Changing the measure.  The notion of randomness evidently depends 
             on the underlying measure.  For example, the strong law of large numbers guarantees 
             that sequences that are ML-random with respect to the Bernoulli measure Bp have 
             limit frequency p, so for different p we get disjoint sets of random sequences.  Still 
             from the viewpoint of computability theory the properties of ML-random sequences 
             (with respect to a computable measure P) do not depend on P—except for some 
             trivial cases.
                 The trivial case we have in mind is the following one:  if a computable measure 
             // has an atom, i.e., if some sequence (a singleton) has positive //-measure, then this 
             sequence is random  (it cannot be an element of a //-null set).  Such a sequence is 
             always computable.  This is a corollary of Theorem 79(h) (p. 123), but has also the 
             following simple proof.  Assume that {w} has a positive probability e with respect 
             to  a computable distribution //.  Let us consider //-measures of the sets     where 
             X is a prefix of w.  These measures decrease as x becomes longer,  and their limit 
             is £.  Wait until some of them become less than  l.le.  If x is such a prefix,  only 
             one of the strings t0 and xl has //-measure greater than 0.9e, and this prefix can 
             be effectively  found since //  is  computable.  So  the sequence can  be  computably 
             extended starting from this point.
                 To  avoid  this  special  case,  we  consider  only  atomless  measures  where  each 
             individual  sequence  has  measure  0.  If /q  and  //2  are  two  computable  atomless 
             measures,  then the sets of ML-random sequences with respect to /q  and //2  are 
             essentially the same from the computability viewpoint:
                 Theorem  121.  Let /q  and //2  be two atomless measures.  Then there exists a 
             bijection between the sets of ML-random sequences with respect to /q  and //2  that 
             in both directions is a restriction of a computable mapping of type £ —>•£.
                 In other words, there exist oracle machines M12, M21 with the following prop­
             erties:  if an oracle is a sequence ш that is ML-random with respect to /q, then 
             is an infinite sequence that is random with respect to //2, and vice versa; these two 
             mappings are mutually inverse (on random sequences).
                 Proof.  Following [225], consider first a special case when one of the measures 
             (say, //2) is the uniform measure on [0,1].  We want to construct a one-to-one cor­
             respondence between sequences that are /q-random and uniformly random points 
             in  [0,1].  As usual,  we split  [0,1]  into two intervals:  the left interval 7To  of length 
            /q(L>0), and the right interval 7Ti of length /q(f2i).  Each of the intervals 7To and 7Ti 
            is then split in a similar way, etc.  Then for each sequence uj consider a real number 
            that is a common point of all 7rx  for all prefixes x of cj.  Since /q  has no  atoms, 
            such a common point is unique.
