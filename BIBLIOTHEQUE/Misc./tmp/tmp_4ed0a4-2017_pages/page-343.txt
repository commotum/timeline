                                     10.8.    COMBINATORIAL INTERPRETATION: THE GENERAL CASE                                                 331
                   (the  sums  in  the  left-hand  side  and  the  right-hand  side  are  disjoint:  all  7’s  are 
                   different from all J ’s, and the coefficients А/ and ßj are positive).
                         How can we translate  this  inequality  into  a  combinatorial  statement?  The 
                   examples above suggest the following translation:
                                 Consider a set A c X\ x • • • x Xn.  Let n7 be arbitrary positive 
                                 numbers such that Пмл' =
                                                                i                  j
                                 Then A can be covered by some Bj such that
                                                                       mB,(I) < n7.
                   Unfortunately, we can prove this statement only with logarithmic factors (though 
                   one can hope that the stronger statement, say with 0(l)-factors, is also true).  Here 
                   is the weaker version:
                                 For some constant d, for every X\,... ,Xn, for every finite A c 
                                 X\ x • • • x Xn and for every family of positive numbers n7 (one 
                                 number for each I in the left-hand side) such that
                                                              Пмл'=
                                                                i                  j
                                 there is a cover of A by sets Bj such that 
                                                               mBl(I) <             •  (log|i4|)d.
                         Theorem 213.  This statement is true for some coefficients А/  and ßj if and 
                   only if
                                                    Y  AiG(x,) < Y                             + O(logJV)
                  for all N and for all strings aq,..., xn of complexity at most N.
                         PROOF.  Assume that the inequality for complexities is true.  Let us show how 
                   a given set A can be split into parts of the required size.  First of all, we may assume 
                  without loss of generality that the elements of A are tuples of strings (x\,..., xn), 
                   and the length of all strings is bounded by N = log \A\ (we have enough strings for 
                  that).
                         Let us assume for now that the set A is simple (it has complexity O(logiV)). 
                  Then all its projections are simple,  so the complexities of every element of some 
                  projection is bounded by the logarithm of its size (with 0(log iV)-precision).  Then 
                   for every element  (aq,..., xn) G A, we have
                                                          C(xj) ^ logm^(J) + O(logiV)
                  for all J.  Adding all these inequalities with coefficients ßj, we conclude that
                                             ^2 ßjC(xj) ^ log ( l \m A( j y f  +O(l0gJV).
                                               J                           '   J                '
                  Now we use the inequality for complexity (which we assume to be true)  and the 
                   condition for nj, and we conclude that
                              ^2 ^iC(xi) < bg ( П  n ) 1 ) + °(loS N) = ^2 Xi loS ni + О (log N)
                                I                         ^  I         '                          I
