         and the decompressing program finds any typical element of that set, the person 
         contemplating the picture will hardly notice any difference.
            We should remember that this is just an analogy and we should not expect that 
         mathematical theorems on Kolmogorov complexity of two-part descriptions will be 
         directly applied in practice.  One of the reasons for that is our ignoring the compu­
         tational complexity of decompressing programs and ignoring compressing programs 
         at all.  It might be that it is this ignoring that implies paradoxical independence of 
         some minimal models on the string x mentioned earlier.
