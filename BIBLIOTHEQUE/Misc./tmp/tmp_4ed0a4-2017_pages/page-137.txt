                                                 5.3.   A  PRIORI  COMPLEXITY AND ITS PROPERTIES                                                      123
                           (b)  KA (X) < l(x) + 0(1) for each x.
                           (c)  KA (x) < K(x) + 0(1) for each x.
                           (d) Let £o,£i, • • •  be a computable sequence of incompatible binary strings  (i.e., 
                    none of them is a prefix of another one).  Then
                                                      KA (Xi) = K{Xi) + 0(1) = K(i) + 0(1).
                           (e)  K(x) ^ KA (x) + 2 logl(x) + 0(1).
                           (f)  Moreover, K(x) ^ KA (x) + K(l(x)) + 0(1).
                           (g)  and even more, K(x\l(x)) < KA (x) + 0(1).
                           (h)  A  sequence  of zeros  and  ones  is  computable  if and  only  if the  a priori 
                    complexity of its prefixes is bounded.
                           (i)  If f  : £ —> Nj_  is  a computable continuous mapping,  then
                                                                  K(f(x))^KA(x) + 0( 1) 
                   for each string x such that f(x)  is defined  (is not equal to _L).
                          Proof,  (a) The measure of a subset of a set does not exceed the measure of 
                    the set itself.
                           (b) The function p(x) = 2 ~1^  is a lower semicomputable semimeasure.  There­
                    fore p(x) ^ ca(x) for some c and all x.
                          (c)  The  machines  that  output  a  binary  string  (as  a  whole)  and  then  halt, 
                    form a subclass of the machines that generate output bits one by one.  Therefore, 
                    m(x) ^ ca(x) where m is the discrete a priori probability (as defined in Chapter 4).
                          It  is  instructive to rephrase this argument using semimeasures.  Let m'(x) be 
                    the sum of m(y) taken over all strings y that have prefix x (including x itself).  Here 
                    m is the discrete a priori probability.  Modify m! , and let m'(A) be equal to 1.  Then 
                   m! is a semimeasure on the binary tree and therefore m(x) < m'(x) = 0 (a(x)).
                          (d) Let Xi be a computable sequence of incompatible binary strings.  The func­
                   tion i H a(xi)  (where a is the continuous a priori probability) is a lower semicom­
                   putable semimeasure on N.  Indeed, it is lower semicomputable; the events “output 
                   starts with xf  are disjoint,  and therefore the sum of their probabilities does not 
                   exceed 1.  Therefore K(i) < К A (xf) + 0(1).
                          On the other hand, K(xi) = K(i) + 0(1), since i can be algorithmically trans­
                   formed into Xi and vice versa; finally, KA (xi) ^ K(xi) + 0(1) according to (c).
                          (e)  Let  a  be the universal continuous semimeasure.  Consider the function и 
                   defined  as  u(x) — a(x)/l(x)2.  It  is  lower  semicomputable.  Moreover,  since  the 
                   sum of a(x) over all strings x of length n does not exceed 1  (these strings are all 
                   incompatible), we get
                                                   £«<*> = £   £                                             =
                                                     X                 n  l(x)=n                   n
                   so we get the desired inequality.
                          (f)  This can be proved in a similar way.  This time we let u(x) = a(x)m(l(x)) 
                   where m is the a priori probability on N (as defined in Chapter 4).
                          (g)  Consider the function
                                                              u(x, n)             a(x),  if l(x) = n, 
                                                                                       0,  if l(x) /  n.
