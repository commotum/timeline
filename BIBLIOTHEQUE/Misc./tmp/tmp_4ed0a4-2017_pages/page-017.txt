        xviii           BASIC NOTIONS AND NOTATION
        information in random variables £ and rj and is denoted by I(£:rj).  A similar no­
        tation I(x:y) is used in algorithmic information theory.  As I(x:y) is commutative 
        only up to a small error term, we usually say  “the information in x about y”  and 
        define this notion as C(y) — C(y\x).
