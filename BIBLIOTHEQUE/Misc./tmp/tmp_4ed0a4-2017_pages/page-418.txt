                                             13.4.   EXAMPLES AND THE PROOF OF THEOREM  238                                                   409
                   there is no indication which of these two possibilities happens, so in fact we exhibit 
                   a solution to the problem
                                            (((.t -*y)^y)^ (X V y)) -»> {(x ->• y)V(y -> x)).
                   This is enough to get the required bound for the complexity.
                         Here is the idea.  Let p  be a solution to ((x —>■ y) —> y)  —>■ (x V y).  We need to 
                   convert either x  to y  or y  to x.  Both x  and y  can be used to construct a solution 
                   for (x  —> y) —> y;  indeed, y  can be converted into a program that maps everything 
                   to y,  and  x  can be used  to  convert  (x  —> y)  to  y.  Then we can apply p  to this 
                   solution and get a solution to ж V y, i.e., x  or y.  If it happens that we get the other 
                   string (not the one we started with), we succeed in transformation of x  to у  or vice 
                   versa.  But why may we hope to be so lucky?
                         We apply a tool from computability theory.  Fix a pair of disjoint coinputably 
                   enumerable sets А, В  C N that cannot be separated by a decidable (=computable) 
                   set.  The latter means that every decidable set that contains  A  has a non-empty 
                   intersection with В  (and vice versa).
                         For  every  natural  i  and  for  every two  strings  u,v,  we  consider  the  program 
                   qi(u,v)  that works as follows (its input s  is considered as a program):
                                 qi(u,v) on input s:
                                           i £ A: output v,
                                           i  £ B: output  [s](w);
                                           [s](u) — v:  output v — [s](w).
                   This means that g?(u, v)  enumerates A, В  and applies s to м in parallel,  waiting 
                   until one of the three events (listed before the colons) happens, and then performs 
                   the described action.  Note that the first and second conditions are disjoint  (since 
                   A  and В  are disjoint); the third condition is not disjoint with the first two, but the 
                   action is the same anyway.
                         The construction guarantees the following properties:
                         (1)  if i £ A,  then for every и  the program qi(u, y) is a solution to (x  —> y) —> y\
                         (2) if г £ В,  then for every v  the program qi(x, v) is a solution to (x  —>■ y) —> y.
                         (3)  for  every i the program qi(x, y)  is a solution  to (x  —»■ y)  —»■ у.
                   Therefore,  in  all three  cases \p](qi(u, v))  is a solution to  x V  у (by  our assumption
                   on p).
                         Now we can present programs rq  and Г2  and prove that either rq  maps x  to 
                   у  or Г2  maps у  to x.  The program rq  applies p  to qi(x,v)  for all i £ В  and for 
                   all strings v  in parallel, and waits until p  produces an output of the form [1, z]  for 
                   some z]  then rq  outputs 2.  Similarly, Г2  applies p  to qi(u,y)  for alii £ A  and for
                   all u,  and waits  until p  gives output  [0, z]  for some 2; then Г2  outputs 2.
                         The properties of qi  mentioned above guarantee the correctness of the output; 
                   it  remains to show that at least one of the events will happen.  Assume that it is 
                   not the case and [p](qi{x,v))  always starts with 0 (for all i £ В  and for all v) and 
                   \p](qi(u,y))  always starts with  1  (for all i  £  A  and for all u).  In particular,  this 
                   happens for v = у  and и = x.  Recall that  \p](qi(x,y))  is defined for all i,  and in 
                   this way we can compute a separator for A  and B,  a contradiction.                                                         □
                         The formula used in this theorem already looks quite complicated.  However, 
                   for Theorem 238 we need to go even farther and consider some generalizations of 
                   the problem ((x  —» £/) —» y)  —»• (x V y).
