         The left-hand side is
                                          JV,
         so this is possible only if

                                I
         as we claimed.
           The other direction is much less trivial.  We want to show that if the inequality 
         is true for entropies, it should be true for complexities with logarithmic error.  Here 
         some strings x\,..., xn  are given,  and we need to  construct  a family of random 
         variables whose entropies (and the entropies of their combinations) are close to the 
         complexities so we can apply the inequality for entropies.  This can be done by a 
         typization trick suggested by A. Romashchenko: We consider the set of all tuples of 
         strings x\ ,..., x'n whose complexities and conditional complexities are bounded by 
         the corresponding complexities of xi,... ,xn, and take a random element of this set 
         (with uniform distribution).  See below Section 10.6 (Theorem 212) for the details.
           Further results are related (in different ways) with the combinatorial interpre­
         tation of inequalities.  Let us start with a simple inequality
                        C(xi,x2) ^ C(xi) + C(x2) + O(logiV)
         and try to  understand its  combinatorial meaning.  Let X\  and X2  be finite sets 
         whose elements x\  G X\  and x2  G X2  are considered as messages.  Assume that 
         we have a set A c X\  x X2 whose elements are possible pairs of messages.  Then 
         we  have  \A\  possibilities  for  the  pair  (here  \A\  stands  for  the  cardinality  of A). 
         For the first component the number of possibilities is equal to the size of the first 
         projection of A (the set of x\  such that  (xi,x2)  G A for some x2).  Denoting this 
         number by m(l) and a similar number for the other coordinate by m(2), we can 
         write a combinatorial version of the same inequality,
                           log \ A\  ^ logm(l) + logm(2)
         or
                                |A| < m(l)m(2)
         (the size of a set is bounded by the product of sizes of its projections, an evident 
         observation).
           To  see  a  less  trivial  example,  consider  the  inequality  for  complexities  from 
         Theorem 26 (a similar inequality for entropies is considered in Problem 230):
               2C(xi,x2,x3) ^ C(xi,x2) + C(xi,x3) + C(x2,x3) + O(logiV).
         Using our analogy, we guess that for an arbitrary subset A of the Cartesian product 
         X\ x X2 x X3 the following inequality holds:
                    21og|A| ^ logm(l,2) + logm(l, 3) + logm(2,3),
         where m(i,j) is the number of elements in the projection of A onto X{ x Xj  (see 
         Figure 30) or
                           \A\2  < m(l, 2)m(l, 3)m(2,3).
         And indeed this is true; moreover, this inequality can be deduced from the inequality 
         about complexities using the following simple argument.  For an integer N consider 
         the set AN; we represent elements (xi,x2,x3) G A as columns of height 3, so every
