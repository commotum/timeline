                                   12.12.  MINIMAL  SUFFICIENT STATISTICS                    391
                 (Hint:  For each x consider a vector containing all P[X = x \ в = t] for all values 
             t of the random variable в.  Then iV is a sufficient statistic if and only if every two 
             arguments with the same values of N correspond to proportional vectors.)
                 The search  for  minimal  sufficient  statistics  can  be  described  as  follows:  We 
             consider random variables X' such that H{X'\X) — 0  (i.e.,  functions of X)  and 
             select  those for which the value H{B\X')  is minimal.  Then we minimize H(X') 
             among the selected random variables.
                 Now we try to find an algorithmic information counterpart of this procedure. 
             Let us consider two strings A (which corresponds to в) and В (which corresponds 
            to  X).  We want to select some part В'  of information in  В for which C{A\B') 
            reaches  the  minimal possible value  C(A\B).  Among those  B'  we  then want  to 
            select one with minimal C(B') so it can be considered as an algorithmic version of 
            minimal sufficient statistics.
                 This setting can be explained in terms of information transmission using Fig­
            ure  49.  Here  B'  (a function  of В)  is  sent  via a channel  of capacity  g,  and  the 
            conditional  description  of A  given  B'  is  sent  via  a  channel  of capacity p.  The 
            minimal statistics problem can be now stated as follows—minimize q for minimal 
            possible p « C(A \ В).
                 Let us consider some more general questions.  For which p and q is the informa­
            tion transmission request  (for given A and В)  fulfillable?  The necessary cut-flow 
            conditions are (with logarithmic precision) C( A) ^ p + q and C( A | B) ^ p.
                 331 Find cuts that give these conditions.
                 For some pairs A, В these necessary conditions turn out to be sufficient.
                 332 Show that if A and В have extractable common information (e.g., A and 
            В are overlapping substrings of some incompressible string), then these necessary 
            conditions are also sufficient.
                 {Hint:  The condition C(A\B) ^ p guarantees that we can send the part of A 
            outside В along the left channel,  plus some other part of A,  and the rest can be 
            sent along the right channel—the condition C(A) ^ p + q guarantees that there is 
            enough capacity.)
                 However,  as we will see,  in the general case the necessary conditions are not 
            sufficient.  To provide an example in which this happens, let us fix the complexities 
            and conditional complexities of A and B.  We agree that A and В have complexity 
            2n, and the pair (A. В) has complexity 3n.  (So the conditional complexities C(A | В) 
            and C(B\ A) are about n.)  Figure 50 shows necessary conditions p + q ^ 2n and 
            p ^ n for this case.
                 Now let us try to find some values of p and q when the request is guaranteed 
            to  be  fulfillable  (whatever A  and  В  are,  assuming they have complexities as we 
            agreed).  We can send the string A along the left channel, so the request is feasible 
            for p — 2n and q = 0 (and, of course, for all bigger p and q).  Another possibility is 
            to send В completely along the right channel, so the request is feasible for p = n, 
            q = 2n (and for bigger p and q).  In this way we get two quadrants with vertices 
            (2n,0) and (n, 2n).  Moreover, if we delete (say, the last) к bits from В (which we 
            assume to be incompressible),  then the conditional complexity C(A\B)  increases 
            at most by к, so the request is feasible for q = 2n — k, p — n + k.  So in the dark 
            grey region on Figure 51  (denoted there by G) the request is always feasible.
