              1 1 2             4.  A  PRIORI  PROBABILITY  AND  PREFIX  COMPLEXITY
                  4.7.4.        Plain  and  prefix  complexities  revisited.  We  have  already  seen 
              some  bounds  for  prefix  complexity  in  terms  of plain  complexity  (Theorem  65). 
              There are many other relations between them.  For example, the following observa­
              tion (made by Levin) shows that plain complexity can be defined in terms of prefix 
              (conditional) complexity.
                  Theorem 72.  Plain complexity C(x) can be defined as the value of i such that 
              K{x\i)  = i.  More precisely,  K(x\C(x))  =  C(x) + 0(1);  on the other hand,  if 
              K(x\i) = i + 5, then C(x) = i + 0(S).
                  Proof.  We already noted (see Problem 44 on p. 40), that C(x) < C(x\C(x)) 
              with 0(l)-precision.  On the other hand, K(x\C(x)) < C(x) with the same preci­
              sion.  Indeed, the minimal (plain) description for x can be considered as a prefix-free 
              one if its length is given as a condition.  So the first statement is proven.
                  It remains to note that K(x\i) changes slowly (as i changes):  changing i by d, 
              we change this complexity by O(logd).  So the equation K(x\i) = i has a unique 
              (up to 0(1)) solution; when i deviates by some p from this solution, the difference 
              between i and К(x \ i) is proportional to p.                                               □
                  As noted recently by B. Bauwens, this statement can be used to relate plain and 
              prefix complexity.  Let us start with a special case of a formula for the complexity 
              of a pair:
                            K(x) = K(x, K(x)) = K(K(x)) + K{x I K(x), K(K(x))).
              This is true with 0(l)-precision.  If we ignore terms of order 0(K(K(K(x)))), the 
              pair  (K(x), К(K(x)))  in the condition can be replaced by K(x) — K(K(x)), and 
             this replacement gives us
                            K(x) -  K(K(x)) = K(x\K(x) -  K(K(x))) + 0(K{3\x))
              (where K^(x) stands for the ith iteration of К).  It remains for us to apply the 
             previous theorem, and we get the following result by R. Solovay [188]:
                  Theorem 73.
                                      C(x) = K(x) - K(K(x)) + 0(К^(х)).
                  This result can be rewritten as
              (*)                     K(x) - C(x) = K(K(x)) + 0(K{3\x)).
             Solovay noted also that we can replace К by C in the right-hand side of (*), i.e., 
             that
                                      K(x) - C(x) = C{C{x)) + 0(C(3)(x)).
             In fact,  0(K(3\x))  and  0(C^3\x))  denote the same precision,  and the equality 
             K(K(x)) — C(C(x)) holds with this precision.
                  Let us explain why.  First of all, the already proved formula (*) for K(x) — C(x) 
             implies that
                                IK(K(x)) - K(C(x))\ < K(3\x) + 0(logR(3\x))
             and
                                IC(K(x)) - C(C(x))\ < K^(x) + 0(logK^3\x))
