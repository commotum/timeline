                       1.2.  ALGORITHMIC  PROPERTIES   29
          We have shown only several (simple) examples that show how Kolmogorov com­
       plexity is related to computability theory (also called recursion theory).  This area 
       is now actively growing, so we refer the interested reader to two recent monographs 
       [147] by A. Nies and [49] by R. Downey and D. Hirschfeldt.
          Theorem 15 selects some very special objects among all objects of complexity n 
       (in fact, one object up to equivalence is described above).  At first glance, this seems 
       strange:  our  intuition  says  that  all  random  (incompressible)  strings  of length n 
       should be indistinguishable,  and any special property of a string could be used to 
       compress it.  However, we have found a very special random string 7n of length n. 
       This paradox can be explained as follows:  the individual properties of 7n do allow 
       us to find a short description for 7n, but we need the oracle for O' to decompress 
       that description.
          We will come back to this question in Section 5.7, which discusses “the number 
       of wisdom”  fl, and in Section 14.3, which studies two-part descriptions.
          Finally, let us note that although all the objects in Theorem 15 are equivalent, 
       they have very different lengths.  The lengths of (a),  (b),  (e)-(i) are about n while 
       the length of (c) and (d) grows faster than every computable function of n.
