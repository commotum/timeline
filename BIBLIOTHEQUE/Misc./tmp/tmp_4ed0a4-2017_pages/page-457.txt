          the second one, which can be called the optimality deficiency and is defined as
                             ö(x\A) =log#A + C(A)-C(x),
          shows how far the two-part description of x using A is from the optimum.  How are 
          these two numbers related?  First let us make an easy observation.
             Theorem 260.  The randomness deficiency of a string x of a finite set A does 
          not exceed its optimality deficiency (with logarithmic precision,  as usual; here l(x) 
          stands for the length of x) :
                              d(x\ A) < 5{x\ A) + 0(log/(x)).
             Proof.  We need to prove that
                   logФА -  C(x\A) < logфА + C(A) -  C(x) + 0(logl(x)).
          Canceling the term log фА, we get an inequality
                           C(x) ^ C(A) + C(x\A) + 0(logl(x)).
          Its right-hand side is the complexity of the pair (x, A) with accuracy О (log C(x, A)), 
          and it is larger than C(x) with accuracy О (log C(x | A)).  Note that the bound we are 
          proving should hold with 0(log/(x))-precision,  and 0(logC'(x| A))  — 0(log/(x)).
                                                                         □
             This argument shows that the difference between these two deficiencies is close 
          to C(x, A) — C(x), i.e., to C(A\x) with precision 0(\ogl(x) + logC(A)), and this is 
          0(log/(x)) if C(A) = 0(C(x)).  (There is no sense in considering the explanations 
          that are much more complex than the object they try to explain, so we will always 
          assume that C(A) = 0(C(x)).)
             It is easy to give an example of a hypothesis whose optimality deficiency exceeds 
          significantly its randomness deficiency.  Let x be a random string of length n, and 
          let  В  be  the  set  of all  strings  of length  n  plus  some  random  string  у  of length 
          n — 1  that  is  independent  of x.  Then  C(B\x)  is close to  n,  and the  optimality 
          deficiency is about n, while the randomness deficiency is still small (including у in 
          the set of all strings of length n does not much change the randomness deficiency 
          of x in that set).  In this example, the hypothesis В looks bad from the intuitive 
          viewpoint:  It contains an irrelevant element у which has nothing in common with 
          the x that we try to explain.  Eliminating this y, we improve the hypothesis and 
          make its optimality deficiency close to its randomness deficiency (which is small in 
          both cases).
             Recall that we have proved Theorem 256 which shows that the situation in this 
          example is general:  If for a given hypothesis В for a string x the difference between 
          the optimality deficiency 5{x\B)  and randomness deficiency d(x\B) is large (this 
          difference is about C(B\x), as we have seen), then one can find another hypothesis 
          A of the same size and of the same (and even smaller by C(B\x)) complexity such 
          that S(x\ A) does not exceed d(x\B).
             Therefore, the question whether for a given string x there exists a set A with 
          C(A)  <  a  and  d(x\A)  <  ß  (asked  in  the  definition  of  (a, /3)-stochasticity),  is 
          equivalent  (with logarithmic precision)  to the question of whether there exists a 
          set  A  with  C(A)  <  a  and  S(x\A)  <  ß.  That  is,  the set  Px  contains  the  same 
          information about x as the set Qx of pairs  (a, ß)  for which x is  (a,/3)-stochastic, 
          but using different coordinates.
