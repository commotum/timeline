           (it is also true up to a constant factor).  Multiplying these two inequalities, we get 
           the inequality             n—1    n—1
                                      ГИ^п ^  ~
                                      i=0    i=0
           which is obvious anyway  (without any constant).  Due to our assumptions about 
           Ti  (separation from 0)  and Si  (the convergence of ^2 Sf),  the last inequality is an 
           equality  (up to a 0(l)-factor).  Indeed,  the product  П(1 ~ Ы)  is strictly positive 
           (assuming that 0 < hi < 1) if and only if ^  hi < oo.
               Now the main point:  Since the product of two inequalities is an equality, then 
           each  of them  is  also  an  equality  (up  to  a  0(l)-factor).  Then  the  randomness 
           criterion  (Theorem 90) guarantees that on is random also with respect to p'  (and 
           also p", but this does not matter).  So the statement (a) is proven.
               For statement  (b)  we postpone the proof since it works for the more general 
           case of dependent trials, and we will prove it soon in this more general version; see 
           Theorem 197 below.                                                     □
              The classical version of Kakutani’s theorem can now be proven as a corollary:
               276 Let Vo,V\,P2, ■ ■ •  and Po,p[,P2 , ■ ■ •  be sequences of reals in  (e, 1 — e)  for 
           some £ > 0.  Consider the measures p and p' that correspond to independent trials 
           with success probabilities pi and p', respectively.  Prove that:
               (a) if XXPi ~Pi)2 < oo, the classes of null sets with respect to p and p' are the 
           same;
               (b)  if YliVi — Pi)2  = oo, then p and p' are orthogonal  (there exists a set that 
           has measure 0 with respect to one measure and measure 1 with respect to the other 
           one).
               (Hint:  Use Theorem 196 in a relativized version.  Note that for every null set 
           one can find an oracle that makes the measures computable and makes this set an 
           effectively null one.  For (b) consider the set of random sequences.)
              Now we formulate this more general statement.  Let p be a measure on Q, and 
           let p(x) = p(£lx) be the corresponding function on binary strings.  If p(x) > 0 for 
           some X,  we can consider the conditional probabilities of 0 and  1  after x,  i.e.,  the 
           ratios p(0\x) — p(x0)/p(x) and p( 1 \ x) = p(xl)/p(x)  (their sum is 1).  For the case 
           of independent trials these values depend only on the length of x (and were denoted 
           earlier by pi).
              If,  in  addition to p,  some sequence on €  Q, is fixed,  we may consider the con­
           ditional probabilities of 1  after each term of this sequence, i.e., the sequence of pi 
           defined as
                        Pi = p (l|w 0 • ■ -Wi-i) =p(w0 • • -^_11)/р(а;о ■ --Wi-i)
           (they  are well  defined  if p  is  not  equal  to  zero  on  the  prefixes  of cu).  The  next 
           result  [207]  shows  that  these  probabilities  for  a  given  sequence  do  not  depend 
           much on the measure that makes this sequence random:
              Theorem  197.  Let w  be  a sequence  that  is  ML-random  with  respect  to  two 
           computable measures p and p!.  Assume that the conditional probabilities pi  and p\ 
           along ua  constructed using p and p'  are all in the interval (e, 1 — e) for some e > 0. 
           Then
                                       ^ ( P i- P ’i)2 < oo.
