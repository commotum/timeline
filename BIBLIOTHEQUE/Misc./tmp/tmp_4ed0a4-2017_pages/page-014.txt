                                     Basic notions and notation
                   This section is intended for people who are already familiar with some notions 
              of Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic randomness theory and want to take 
              a quick look at the terminology and notation used throughout  this book.  Other 
              readers can (and probably should) skip it and look back only when needed.
                   The set of all integer numbers is denoted by Z,  the notation N refers to the 
              set of all non-negative integers (i.e.,  natural numbers), R stands for the set of all 
              reals.  The set of all rational numbers is denoted by Q.  Dyadic rationale are those 
              rationale having the form m/2n for some integer m and n.
                   The cardinality of a set A is denoted by \A\.
                   When the base of the logarithmic function is omitted, it is assumed that the 
              base equals 2, thus logx means the same as log2 x (as usual, ln:r denotes the natural 
              logarithm).
                   We use the notation  [x\  for the integer part of a real number x  (the largest 
              integer number that is less than or equal to x).  Similarly,  \x]  denotes the smallest 
              integer number that is larger than or equal to x.
                   Orders of magnitude.  The notation /  ^ g+ 0(1), where /  and g are expressions 
              containing variables,  means that for some c the inequality /  ^ g + c holds for all 
              values of variables.  In a similar way we understand the expression /  ^ g + 0(h) 
              (where h is non-negative):  it means that for some c for all values of variables, the 
              inequality /  ^ g + ch holds.  The notation f  — g + 0(h)  (where h is non-negative) 
              means that for some c for all values of variables we have \f — g\ ^ ch.  In particular, 
              /  = 0(h) holds if l/l ^ ch for some constant c; the notation /  = Q(h) means that 
              l/l  ^  ch for some constant  c > 0  (usually /  is positive).  The notation /  = 0(fi) 
              means that c\h ^ |/| ^ C2/1 (again, usually /  is positive).
                   В denotes the set  {0,1}.  Finite sequences of zeros and ones are called binary 
              strings.  The  set  of all  binary  strings  is  denoted  by  E.  If A  is  a  finite  set  (an 
              alphabet),  then An  denotes the set of all  strings  of length n  over the  alphabet A, 
              that is,  the set of all sequences of length n, whose terms belong to A.  We denote 
              by A* the set of all strings over the alphabet A  (including the  empty string A of 
              length 0).  For instance, E — B*.  The length of a string x is denoted by l(x).  The 
              notation ab refers to  the  concatenation  of strings  a  and  b,  that  is,  the  result  of 
              appending b to a.  We say that a string a is a prefix of a string b if b = ax for some 
              string x.  We say that a is a suffix of a string b if b = xa for some string x.  We say 
              that a is a substring of b, if b = xay for some strings x and у (m other words, a is 
              a suffix of a prefix of b or the other way around).
                   We also consider infinite sequences of zeros and ones, and Q denotes the set of 
              all such sequences.  The set of infinite sequences of elements of a set A is denoted 
              by A°°, thus D, = B°°.  For a finite sequence x we use the notation Qx for the set of 
              all infinite sequences that start with x  (i.e., have x as a prefix).  Sets of this form
