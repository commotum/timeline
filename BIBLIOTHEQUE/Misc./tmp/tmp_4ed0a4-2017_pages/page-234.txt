                    (since  conditional  entropy  is  non-negative).  Thus  we easily  obtain the  following 
                    statement:
                           Theorem 143.  Let £ be a random variable with a finite range,  and let f  be a 
                    function defined on that range.  Then
                                                                          я(/(£)) < #(£),
                    where /(£) is a random variable that is a composition of f  and £ (i.ef is applied 
                    to the value o/£).
                           In terms of distribution the transition from £ to /(£) means that we combine 
                    several values into one that sums up the corresponding probabilities.
                           Proof.  Indeed, the random variable (£,/(£)) has the same distribution as £, 
                    and its entropy cannot be less than the entropy of the second coordinate.                                                            □

                           PROOF.  Let us use once more that the logarithm is a strictly convex function: 
                    the inequality
                                                                 b g
