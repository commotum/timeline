                                                 10.6.  TYPIZATION TRICK                                  327
              In particular,  this is true for the initial tuple  (xi,... ,xn),  so we get the required 
              bound for the cardinality.
                   Let us show now that the set A(xi,..., xn) is c-uniform for some constant c the 
              depends polynomially on N.  For that let us consider both sides of the inequality
                      m(l, 2,..., n) ^ ra( 1) ■ m(211) • m(311, 2) • ... ■ m(n | 1,2,..., n — 1).
              The logarithms of the factors in the right-hand side do not exceed the corresponding 
              complexities:  m( 1) ^ 2c^Xl\ since by construction we have C(y\) < C(x\) for every 
              tuple (yi,... ,yn) G A(x\,... ,xn)  (to be exact, one should write 2c(Xl)+1, but all 
              our estimates have logarithmic precision anyway).  For the same reasons we have 
              m(2|l)  ^ 2c^X2^Xl>)  and so on.  We conclude that the logarithm of the right-hand 
              side does not exceed
                     C(x i) + C(x2 \xi) + C(x3 \xi,x2) H------1- C(xn \xi,.. • ,xn_i) + 0(1),
              and this  sum is  equal  to  C(xi,... ,xn) + 0(\ogN).  But  we know  also  that  the 
              logarithm of the left-hand side is at least C(xi,..., xn) — О (log N), so the difference 
              between logarithms is O(logiV) and both sides differ at most by a polynomial (in 
              N) factor.  As a byproduct we conclude that
                              C{xi Ixi,... ,x»_i) = logm(i 11, • • • ,i -  1) + O(logiV), 
              and a similar argument (with the permuted indices and grouped terms) shows that 
                                         C(xj\xi) = log m(J 11) + O(logiV) 
              for every disjoint I and J.                                                                  □
                   The construction used in the proof may be called a typization trick:  starting 
              from a tuple, we construct the set where this tuple is typical.
                   Now it is easy to finish the proof of the promised result:
                   Theorem 212 (A. Romashchenko).  Every linear inequality
                                                     i
              that is true for arbitrary random variables £i,...,£n>              a ^s0   true for strings  of 
              complexity at most N with О (log N) -precision,
                                               £>/*■(6) « 0(logJV).
                                                 I
                   Here the constant hidden in О (log AT) depends on n (and grows exponentially 
              as n increases) but not on the strings Xi,..., xn.
                   PROOF.  The reverse implication (every inequality that is true for complexities 
              is also true for entropies) was proven in Section 10.1.
                   Now  we  are  ready  to  go  in  the  other  direction.      Assume  that  this  linear 
              inequality  is  true  for  entropies.   Consider  arbitrary  strings  xi,...,xn  and the 
              set A = A(xi,...,xn)  from the previous theorem.  Consider a random variable 
              (£i,... ,£n)  that is uniformly distributed in A.  Since the set A is jVc-uniform, the 
              entropies  are  О (log iV)-close  to  the sizes  of the corresponding sections,  as Theo­
              rem 210 says.  On the other hand, the log-sizes logm(/| J) (even for the conditional 
              case, though we need this only for J = 0 ) coincide with corresponding complexities 
              with 0(logiV)-precision (Theorem 211).                                                       □
