             constructed in that proof had complexity a and therefore its a priori probability is 
             2 ~a  (as usual, we ignore O(logn) corrections needed, now in the exponent).
                 To get an upper bound, consider the sum of m(x) over all strings of length n. 
             That sum is a real number ш ^ 1.  Let ш be the number represented by first a bits 
             in the binary representation of w.
                 Consider the following measure P on strings  of length n associated with Q. 
             Start  lower  semicomputation of m(x)  for  all  strings  x  of length  n  and  continue 
             until the sum of all obtained lower bounds for m{x) reaches Q.  Let P{x)  be the 
             lower bound for m(x) we get at that time.  If Q and n are given, we can compute 
             P(x) for all x of length n.  Therefore the complexity of P is at most a.  The sum of 
             differences between m(x) and P(x) over all strings of length n is bounded by 2~a.
                 As we saw in Problem 348, one can use arbitrary finite probabilistic distribution 
             in the definition of stochasticity (with an 0(logn)-change in the parameters), not 
             only the uniform ones.  It remains to be shown that the total a priori probability 
             of all strings x that have d(x\P) > ß is bounded by 2~a.  Indeed, for those strings 
             we have
                                           log P(x) — C(x IP) > ß.
             The complexity of P is bounded by a and therefore C{x) exceeds C(x\P) at most 
             by a.  Thus we have
                                          — logP(x) — C(x) > ß — a.
             We ignore 0(logn)-terms, so we can replace plain complexity by prefix complexity:
                                          — log P(x) — К(x) > ß — a.
             Prefix complexity can be defined in terms of a priori probability, so we get
                                           log(m(x)/P(x)) > ß — a
             for  all  x  that  have  deficiency  exceeding  ß  with  respect  to  P.  By  assumption, 
             a  <  ß  with  some  safety  margin  (enough  to  compensate  all  the  simplifications 
             we made),  so  we  may  assume that  for  all  those  x  we  have  P(x)  <  m(x)/2,  or 
             (m(x) — P(x)) > m(x)/2.  Recall that the sum of m(x) — P(x) over all x of length 
             n does not exceed 2~Q by construction of ш.  Hence the sum of m(x) over all strings 
             of deficiency (with respect to P) exceeding ß is at most 2”a+1, and this is what we 
             wanted to prove.                                                                    □
                 The notion of a stochastic object can be considered as a finite analog of the 
             notion  of an  ML-random  sequence with respect  to  a computable  measure.  The 
             following problem expresses this similarity in more formal terms.
                  349        Assume that  a sequence ш  is  ML-random with respect  to  some  com­
             putable  measure.  Prove that  for  all  n  the  n-bit  prefix  of the  sequence  ш  is  an 
             (O(logn), 0(logn))-stochastic string.  (Hint:  Use  Problem  348.)  Conclude  that 
             there is an infinite sequence that is not ML-random with respect to any computable 
             measure.  (Hint:  Adding a short prefix does not affect non-stochasticity.)
                 Historical remarks.  The first definition of (a, /3)-stochasticity was given by Kol­
             mogorov (the authors learned it from his talk given in 1981 [83], but most probably 
             it was formulated earlier in 1970s; the definition appeared in print in [174]).  Kol­
             mogorov and Shen ([174]) used the formula log |A| —C(x) for randomness deficiency.
                 The existence of non-stochastic objects (Theorem 248) was noted in [174].  The 
             first estimates of the a priori measure for the set of non-stochastic objects appeared 
             in [210].  The first tight bound 2  Q for the a priori measure of (a, /3)-non-stochastic
