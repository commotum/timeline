                  Theorem 62.  The function К is the smallest (up to an additive constant term) 
              upper semicomputable function к  (mapping binary strings to natural numbers and 
              -foo)  such that the series      2~k^  converges.
                  Proof.  The function К is upper semicomputable and the series Y^x 
             converges.  Let к be another function having these properties.  Then the function 
             M(x) — c2~k(x^  where c is  a small  enough constant  is  a lower semicomputable 
             semimeasure.  As m(x)  is  the  maximal  lower  semicomputable  semimeasure,  we 
             have M(x) = 0(m(x)), that is, logM(:r) < logra(:r) + 0(1). It follows that K(x) ^ 
             k(x) + 0(1).                                                                              □
                  In  other words,  for  every  upper semicomputable  function к  mapping binary 
             strings to natural numbers and +oo, the two statements
                                  uK(x) ^ k(x) + 0(1)” and U^2X 2~k^  < oo”
             are equivalent.
                  Note that the requirement  “the series         2~k^   converges”  is stronger than
             the requirement “the number of x such that k(x) < n is 0(2n)” used in Theorem 8. 
             Indeed, if Y^x 2~k^  ^ O, then the number of x such that k(x) ^ n is at most C2n. 
             This observation gives another proof of the inequality C(x) ^ K(x) + 0(1).
                  It  is  instructive  to  compare  plain  and prefix complexity  in two  aspects:  the 
             average complexity of strings of given length and the number of strings that have 
             complexity not exceeding a given bound.  Let us start with the first question.
                  We have seen that the plain complexity of most strings of length n is close to n 
             (p. 8 and Problem 2, p.  17).  One could expect the prefix complexity to be slightly 
             bigger.
                  Theorem 63.  (a) K(x) < l(x) + K(l(x)) + 0(1).
                  (b)      For some constant c and for all n, d the fraction of strings x such that 
             K(x) < n + K(n) — d among all strings of length n is at most c2~d.
                  Proof,  (a)  Let  m(x)  be  the  a  priori  probability  of a  binary  string  x  and 
             m(n)  be the  a priori probability  of a natural  number n.  Consider the function 
             m'(x)  =  2~nm(n)  where n is the length of x.  The sum of m'(x)  over strings of 
             length n is equal to  m(n)  hence  ^^ra^a;)  ^  1-  Since the function ml  is  lower 
             semicomputable, we conclude that m'(x)  < cm(x) for some constant c and all x. 
             Taking the logarithms, we obtain the inequality
                                             K(x) ^ n + K(n) + 0(l)
             (the constant 0(1) does not depend on n).
                  (b)  Consider the function
                                               m'(n) =          m(x),
                                                         l(x)=n
             the total a priori probability of all strings of length n.  Since m'(n)  is lower semi­
             computable and Xlnm/(n)  ^  I**  we have m'(n)  = 0(m(n)).  On the other hand, 
             the a priori probability of the string consisting of n zeros is at least cm(n) for some 
             positive constant c.  Thus we have
                                         cim(n) <  ^   m(x) ^ C2m(n).
