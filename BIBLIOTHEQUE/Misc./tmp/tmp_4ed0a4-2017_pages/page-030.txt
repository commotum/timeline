                                    SOME APPLICATIONS OF KOLMOGOROV COMPLEXITY                                           13
                     Here is an algebraic corollary of the same inequality.  For every group G and 
                its subgroups X, Y, and Z, we have
                                                Л,     r7\2  ^  \XDY\-\XnZ\-\YnZ\

                where \H\ denotes the number of elements in H.
                     Gödel incompleteness theorem.  Following G. Chaitin, let us explain how 
                to use Theorem 6 in order to prove the famous Gödel incompleteness theorem.  This 
                theorem states that not all true statements of a formal theory that is “rich enough” 
                (the formal arithmetic and the axiomatic set theory are two examples of such a 
                theory) are provable in the theory.
                     Assume that for every string x and every natural number n, one can express 
                the statement C(x) > n as a formula in the language of our theory.  (This statement 
                says that the chosen optimal decompressor D does not output x on any input of 
                length  at  most  n;  one  can  easily  write  this  statement  in  formal  arithmetic  and 
                therefore in set theory.)
                     Let us generate all the proofs  (derivations)  in our theory and select those of 
                them which prove some statement of the form C(x) > n where x is some string 
                and n is some integer  (statements of this type have no free variables).  Once we 
                have found a new theorem of this type, we compare n with all previously found n’s. 
                If the new n is greater than all previous n’s, we write the new n into the  “records 
                table”  together with the corresponding xn.
                     There are two possibilities:  either (1) the table will grow infinitely, or (2) there 
                is the last statement C(X) > N in the table which remains unbeaten forever.  If (2) 
                happens, there is an entire class of true statements that have no proof.  Namely, all 
                true statements of the form C(x) > n with n > N have no proofs.  (Recall that by 
                Theorem 5 there are infinitely many such statements.)
                     In the first case we have infinite computable sequences of strings xq,x\,X2 • • • 
                and numbers no < n\ < П2 < ... such that all statements C(xi) > щ are provable. 
                We assume that the theory proves only true statements;  thus,  all the inequalities 
                                 are  true.  Without  loss  of generality,  we can  assume  that  all Xi  are 
                C(xi) > щ
                pairwise different (we can omit Xi if there exists j < i such that Xj = Xi ; every string 
                can occur only finitely many times in the sequence xq,x\,X2 ... since щ —> oo as 
                i —> oo).  The computable function k, defined by the equation k(xi) = щ, is then an 
                unbounded lower bound for Kolmogorov complexity.  This contradicts Theorem 6.
