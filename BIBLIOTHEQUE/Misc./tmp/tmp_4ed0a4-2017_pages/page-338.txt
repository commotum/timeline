            326          10.  INEQUALITIES FOR ENTROPY, COMPLEXITY AND SIZE
                This property will be used in the next section when we start from a tuple of 
            strings,  construct  a c-uniform  set,  and  then  consider  the  corresponding  random 
            variables.
                                       10.6.  Typization trick
                The following theorem starts from an arbitrary tuple of strings xi,... ,xn and 
            constructs an almost uniform set A in some Cartesian product X\ x X2 x • • • x Xn 
            of finite sets Xi such that \ogm(J\I) « C(xj\xj) with logarithmic precision:
                Theorem 211 (A. Romashchenko).  For every n there exists a constant d such 
            that the following holds: For every N > 1 and for every tuple x\,... ,xn of strings of 
            complexity at most N there exist finite sets X\,..., Xn and an Nd-uniform subset 
            A C X\ x • • • x Xn such that
                                   |logm(J|/) -  C(xj\xj)\ ^dlogN 
           for all disjoint subsets I,J C {1,..., n).
                Note that the sets Xi are not really relevant here:  We can speak instead about 
            a finite set of arbitrary n-tuples with the required size of projections and sections. 
            Note also that a strange condition N > 1 is needed since for N = 1 the bound Nc 
            does not grow as c increases.
               The proof uses the notion of a complexity vector for a tuple of strings.  For-a 
           given tuple Xi,..., xn the complexity vector is the list of all complexities C(xj \xj) 
           for all pairs (/, J) of disjoint subsets of the set of indices {1,..., n}.  Note that the 
           length of this vector is exponential in n:  There are 2n — 1 unconditional complexities 
            (where J — 0 ) and a lot of conditional ones.  Let us denote the complexity vector 
           for xi,... :xn by x(xi,.. .,x„).
               Proof.  Consider  (for  given  xi,...,xn)  the  set  A(xi,...,xn)  of  all  strings 
           yi,...,yn such that
                                     х(у 1, ■ • • ,Уп)  ^   x ( x i , . ..,x„)
           componentwise.  For example, for n — 1 this is the set of all strings of complexity 
           at most C(xi).  For n — 2, we consider all pairs (£1,2:2) such that
                                   C(yi) ^ C(x1),   C{y2) ^ C(x2),
                 C{yi,y2)<C{xi,x2),  C(yi\y2) ^ C(xi\x2),  C{y2 \y1) < C(x2 \x{).
           The set A(x 1,..., xn) is guaranteed to be non-empty—it contains {x\,..., xn).  In 
           fact, it contains about 2c('Xl,---,Xn^  elements.  Indeed, this is an upper bound since 
           the complexity of all elements of this set is bounded by C(x 1,... ,xn).  It remains 
           to show that this set cannot be much smaller.
               Indeed,  knowing the complexity vector x(xi,... ,xn),  we can enumerate the 
           elements of A(x 1,..., xn).  To specify the complexity vector, we need 0(log N) bits. 
           (Note that the number of components in the complexity vector depends only on n, 
           so we consider it as a constant even though this constant grows exponentially in n.) 
           So every element of A(x 1,... ,xn)  can be described by specifying (in addition to 
           the complexity vector) its ordinal number in the enumeration, and therefore every 
           element of A(xi,..., xn) has complexity
                                    log \A{x\,... ,xn)\ + 0(\ogN).
