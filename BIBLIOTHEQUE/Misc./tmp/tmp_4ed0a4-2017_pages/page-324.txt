                             9.13.  CHANGE  IN  THE  MEASURE  AND  RANDOMNESS             311
                When going  from  left  to  right,  the  “random  with  respect  to  partial  com­
            putable martingales sequences”  are Mises-Church-Daley random  (Theorem  190, 
            p.  290);  computably random sequences are Mises-Church random (Theorem 182, 
            p.  279);  Schnorr randomness implies SLLN (Problem 92, p.  70).  But these impli­
            cations cannot be improved:  Kurtz randomness does not imply the SLLN (Prob­
            lem  92,  p.  70);  Schnorr  randomness  does  not  imply  Mises-Church  randomness 
            (Problem 271, p. 284); computably random sequences may be not Mises-Church- 
            Daley random, since in the first case the complexity may grow as O(logn)  (Theo­
            rem 182, p. 279) and in the second case this is impossible (Theorem 188, p. 287); 
            finally, randomness with respect to computable partial martingales does not imply 
            Mises-Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness, since in the first case the complexity of 
            prefixes may be sublinear  (Theorem  190,  p.  290)  while in the second case this is 
            not possible (Theorem 193, p. 293).
                Therefore in each column all the arrows are irreversible (since the consequences 
            in the right column are different for each notion in the left column;  similarly for 
            the right column), so indeed no other implications can be added to our table.
