                       This result implies one more criterion of randomness for lower semicomputable 
                 reals:
                       Theorem 109.  Let a =                       be  a  computable series of non-negative rational 
                 numbers.  The (lower semicomputable) real a is non-random if and only if for every 
                 £  >  0  one  can  effectively produce  an  enumerable  set W  C  N  of indices such that
                 (1)  J2iewri < £ and (2) ^                   со-finite,  i.e.,  contains all sufficiently large integers.
                       PROOF.  If a is not random, it can be covered by intervals with arbitrarily small 
                 total measure.  It remains to consider the set W of all i such that
                                                  [fO +  • • • +  T4_i, Го +  • • • +       +    Г{\
                 is entirely covered by one of those intervals.  In the other direction the statement  is
                 a direct consequence of Theorem 108, just let a* =  ro                             +          • • • + r*_i and hi = r* for
                 i € W (and ff = 0 for i ф W).                                                                                   □
                       This result shows again that the sum of two non-random lower semicomputable 
                 reals is not random (take the intersection of two sets W\  and W2 provided by this 
                 criterion for each of the reals), so we get a new proof of Theorem 107.
                       The trick we used to prove Theorem 108 can be reused for the following problem 
                 (this argument was communicated to us by L. Bienvenu; the original proof in [87] 
                 is much more complicated).
                        163 Let U be an effectively open subset of [0,1] that has measure less than 
                 1.  Assume that U contains all non-ML-random reals.  (For example, U can be one 
                 of the open sets that form a universal Martin-Löf test.)  Prove that the measure of 
                 U is a lower semicomputable random real.
                       (Hint:  Let  a be the measure of U.  If the cover of a with intervals of small 
                 measure is given, we can construct the cover of the minimal real outside U that has 
                 the same measure.  How can we do that? As soon as the current approximation to a 
                 gets into some interval, we imagine that it will not get out of this interval, i.e., only 
                 a small set will be added to the current part of U and will paint an equally small 
                 part  of the current  complement of U going from left to right.  If our assumption 
                 is in fact true (and this will happen at some point), then we indeed will paint the 
                 minimal element outside U.  (The painted part is a union of closed intervals,  not 
                 the open ones, but this does not matter.))
                       5.7.4.  Random  lower  semicomputable  reals  are  complete.  Now it  is
                 easy to  prove the reverse implication  [87]:  Every lower semicomputable random 
                 real is Solovay complete.
                       Let  us start  with the following remark.  Consider two lower semicomputable 
                 reals a and ß presented as limits of increasing computable sequences ai                                     a and 
                 bi  —У ß.  Let  ff  = ai+i — ai  be the sequence of increases in the first sequence.  We 
                 may use the sequence hi  to construct  a strategy for the prediction game against 
                 the second sequence in the following way.  We shift the interval  [ao,^]  to get the 
                 (closed)  interval of the same length that starts at  bo  (Figure  13).  Then we wait 
                 until  bi  at  the  right  of this  interval  appears;  let  6^  be  the  first  term  outside  it. 
                 Then we shift the interval [ai, 02] to get the interval of the same length that starts 
                 at bij ;  let  bi2  be the first bi on the right of it, etc.
                       There are two possibilities:  either
                       (1)  the observer wins in the prediction game, i.e.,  one of the shifted intervals 
                 covers the rest of bi and the next bik  is undefined; or
