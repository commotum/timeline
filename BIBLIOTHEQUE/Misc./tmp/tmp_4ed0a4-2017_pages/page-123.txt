             108             4.  A  PRIORI  PROBABILITY  AND  PREFIX  COMPLEXITY
             check this.  In one of them it it is easy:  the function ^   m([x,y]) is lower semicom- 
             putable since m. is lower seniicomputable.  But in the other case, for the function 
             m([x, y])/m(x),  the  lower seniicomputable  function  m(x)  is  in  the denominator, 
             and when m(x) increases, the ratio decreases.
                 The correct proof of the weaker inequality follows the same scheme but uses 
             some additional tricks.  We have to prove that for z = K(x) the inequality
                                           m(y\x,z) ^ e m([x,y]) 
                                                             m(x)
             holds.  The problem is that the right-hand side is not lower seniicomputable.  But 
             for z = K(x) we can replace m(x) « 2~K^  by 2~z and consider the function
                                           m'(y\x,z) = m{[x,y])2z.
             This function is lower seniicomputable.  But now it is not a semimeasure:  the sum 
                 m'(y \x-. z) is bounded by 1 only if
                                              ^2m([x,y]) ^ 2'\
                                               y
             which is not true if z is large.  However, we know that
                                    ^2m([x,y}) = 0(m(x)) = 0( 2~K{x)), 
                                     y
             so there exists a constant c such that
                                     z ^ K{x)-c^ ^2tm> {y \x, z) ^ 1. 
                                                        y
             But this is not enough:  we need a family of semimeasures that satisfy this inequality 
             for all X and z (and not only for z ~ K(x), as needed for our result).  So we “trim” 
             the function m! and get another function m" such that:
                    •  function (y,x,z)    m"(y \x, z) is lower seniicomputable;
                    •  the inequality
                                              $>"(У|*,*) < 1
                                               y
                      is true for all x and z;
                    •  there exists a constant c such that
                                  z < K(x) — c => m//(y\x, z) — т'(у\х, z).
             How do we perform “trimming”?  This trick was explained in Section 4.2:  we look 
             at the increasing approximations from below and let them through only if they do 
             not violate the required bound for the sum.
                 Now,  comparing m" with the a priori probability and taking the logarithms, 
             we conclude that
                                z ^ K{x) — с => K(y I x, z) ^ K(x,y) — z + d
             for some c, c' and for all x, y, z.
                 Now we let z be equal to z — K(x) — c.  Note also that changing z by 1 changes 
             the value K(y\x, z) by at most 0(1) (increasing/decreasing the second component 
            of a pair is a computable function).  Therefore,
                                 K(y\x,K(x) -  c) = K(y\x,K(x)) + 0(1).                         □
