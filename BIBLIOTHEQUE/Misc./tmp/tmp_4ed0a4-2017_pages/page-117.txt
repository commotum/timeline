             we obtain the following series of inequalities:
                            K(x) ^ l(x) + l(l(x)) + K(l(l(x))) + 0(1),
                            K(x) ^ l(x) + l(l(x)) + l(l(l(x))) + K(l(l(l(x)))) + 0(1),
             etc.  Similar inequalities with C instead of I can be obtained as follows.  Let D be 
             the optimal decompressor for plain (not prefix) Kolmogorov complexity.  Combining 
             the inequalities K(D(y)) ^ K(y) + 0(1) and K{x) ^ l{x) + K{l{x)) + 0(1), we get 
             the following series of inequalities:
                  Theorem 65.
                                K(x)^C(x) + K(C(x)) + 0( 1),
                                K(x) < C(x) + C(C(x)) + K(C(C(x))) + 0(1),
              etc.
                  Note that the second inequality (as well as all others) follows from the first one 
             by iteration.
                  1107 I Prove that
                                          0(x, y) ^ K(x) + C(y) + 0(1)
             for all X, y.
                  {Hint:  One can compute the number of pairs for which the right-hand side is 
             less than n, but it is easier to use prefix-free descriptions.)
                  As we mentioned, one could define random n-bit strings as strings whose (plain) 
             complexity is close to n.  But one can also try to use prefix complexity and require 
             the prefix complexity to be maximal, i.e., close to n + K(n).  The following problem 
             shows that for such strings the plain complexity is also (almost) maximal.
                   108 Let X be an n-bit string such that C(x) ^ n — d for some d.  Show that 
             K(x) ^ n + K(n) — d + O(logd).
                  (Hint:  Join  the  prefix-free  descriptions  for  n  and  d  and  a plain  description 
             for X.)
                  The reverse statement is not true,  as R.  Solovay has shown;  see the already 
             mentioned paper of J. Miller [122] or [136, 6].
                     4.7.  Conditional prefix complexity and complexity of pairs
                  4.7.1.  Conditional prefix complexity.  What is conditional prefix complex­
             ity?  Each  of the  definitions  of prefix  complexity  can  be  modified  by  adding  a 
             condition.
                  We start with a definition using prefix-stable functions.  A function D(y,z) is 
             prefix stable with respect to y if for every 2 the function у     D(y, z) is prefix stable:
                              D(y, z) is defined and у < y'  =>  D(y\z) -  D(y, z).
             We assume here that the first argument of D is a binary string; the notation у ^y' 
             means that у is a prefix of y'.
                  Recall the definition of the (plain) conditional complexity from Section 2.2.  A 
             conditional decompressor (—description mode) is a computable function that maps 
             pairs of binary strings to binary strings.  If D(y, z) = x, then у is called a description 
             of x when z is known.  The complexity of x with condition 2 is the length of the 
             shortest description.  Then we fix an optimal conditional decompressor that gives 
             minimal complexity (up to a constant).
