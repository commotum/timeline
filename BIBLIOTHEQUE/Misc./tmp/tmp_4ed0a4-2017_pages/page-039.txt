                                      1.2.  ALGORITHMIC  PROPERTIES                        23
                    Figure 1.  The definition of B(n): the value C(m) does not exceed 
                    n—1 form — B(n—1) (the case when C(B (n—1)) = n—1 is shown), 
                    and C{m)  ^  n for all m  >  B(n — 1).  At the point  m = B(n), 
                    the value of C does not  exceed n  (the case when C(B(n))  =  n 
                    is  shown),  and  C{m)  >  n  for  all  m  >  B(n).  The  case  when 
                    C(m) is even greater than n + 1 for all m > B(ri) is shown, thus 
                    B(n + 1)  =  B{n).  For m  G  (B(n — 1 ),B(n)],  the value of the 
                    function C^(m) is equal to n.
            number with this property).  Note also that it can happen (for small values of n) 
            that C{m) > n for all m.  In this case we let B(n) — —1.
                The function В can be considered as an inverse function to the function
                                     C^(N) = min{C(m) | m > N}.
            The function C^>  grows very slowly.  It takes the value n between B(n — 1)  and 
            B(n),  more precisely,  on the interval  (B(n — 1 ),Æ(n)].  The slow increase of C^ 
            corresponds to the fast increase of В.  The latter can be illustrated by the following 
            result.
                Theorem 11.  Let f be a computable function from N to N.  Then B(n) ^ f(n) 
            for all but finitely many n.
                Note that /  may be a partial function.  In this case we claim that B(n) > f(n) 
            for all sufficiently large n that are in the domain of /.
                Proof.  As algorithmic transformations do not increase complexity, for some 
            constant c for all n we have
                                   C(f(n)) < C{n) + 0(1) < logn + c.
            On the other hand,  the  definition  of В  and  the  inequality  f(n)  >  B(n)  imply 
            C{f{n)) > n.  Thus
                                        n < C(f(n)) < logn + c 
            whenever f(n) > B(n).  This can happen only for finitely many n.              □
                Let  us  reformulate  the  definition of B(n)  as  follows.  Let  D  be  the  optimal 
            description mode used in the definition of Kolmogorov complexity.  Then B (n) is 
            the maximal value of D on strings of length at most n:
                                     B(n) = max{£)(x) | l(x) < n}.
            Recall that we identify natural numbers and binary strings and consider the values 
            of D as natural numbers.  The minimum of the empty set is defined as —1.
