            of the event “M serves more than 1/8 of quadruples of the form (a, 6, c, Q(a, b, c))”. 
            The product of displayed numbers is equal to 2 raised to the power which is the dif­
            ference of two numbers:  2n+/c+logn+1 and f2(23n).  We need that the latter number 
            be bigger than the former one.  This happens when к = 2n — logn — 0(1).  (Recall 
            that the number of bad triples is small under the condition к ^ 2n — 9, thus all our 
            calculations remain valid.)  The lemma is proven.
                It remains to explain how to guarantee the randomness of the remaining triples 
            {ä, b, d)  and (â, c, d).  The simplest solution is to guarantee this in exactly the same 
            way we guaranteed the randomness of the triple (b,c,d).  That is, we will modify 
            the lemma by requiring that for half of triples  (a, b, c)  not only does the problem 
            (a —> c) A (b —> Q(a,b,c)) have large complexity but that the symmetric problems 
            (c —^ 6) A {a —У Q(a, b, c)) and (b —> a) A (c —>• Q(a, 6, c)) have large complexity also.
                Lemma.  For all sufficiently large n there is a function Q of complexity at most 
            logn + 0(1) such that for more than half of triples (a, b, c)  of words of length n the 
            complexity of each of the problems
             (a—>c) Л (b^Q(a, b, c)),  (c—>b) Л (a^Q(a, b, c)),  and (6—»а) Л (c^Q(a,b,c)) 
            is at least 2 n — О (logn).
                Proof.  Recall  that  the  previous  lemma  was  proven  by  the  probabilistic 
            method:  We have exhibited a property of a function and have shown that a ran­
            domly chosen function does not have that property with exponentially small prob­
            ability.  Now,  instead of one property of a function Q,  we have three symmetric 
            properties.  Each  of the three properties does not  hold with exponentially small 
            probability.  Thus for all large enough n there is a function Q that has all the three 
            properties.  For such a function the number of triples served in at least one of the 
            three ways is at most 1/8 + 1 /8 + 1/8 < 1/2.  The lemma is proven.
                It remains to exhibit another quadruple (a, 6, c, d) of strings that have the same 
            complexities  (as well as their pairs,  triples,  and  the quadruple)  as  (â, b, c, d)  and 
            such that the complexity of the problem C((a —> c) A (b —> d)) is much less than 2n. 
            To this end pick a random string of length 3n and chop it into three parts a, b, c, 
            each of length n.  Then let d = a 0 b ® c.  Given a 0 c, we can transform a to c and 
            b to d.  Hence C((a —> c) A (b —> d)) ^ n  (up to an additive constant).     □
                344       Show that the complexity of the problem (p V q) —> (г V s) also cannot be 
            expressed through complexities of p, q, r, s, their pairs, triples, and the quadruple.
                {Hint:  Let p = a, q = b, r = ac, s = bd where  (a, 6, c, d)  is either of the two 
            quadruples used in the above proof (say,  in the first one).  The complexity of the 
            resulting problem depends on which of the two quadruples we have chosen.  On the 
            other hand, the complexities of p, q, r, s, their pairs, triples, and the quadruple does 
            not depend on this choice.)
                It is instructive to compare the geometric proof with the probabilistic one.  The 
            geometric proof is more constructive than the probabilistic one:  the first quadru­
            ple  is  identified  more  explicitly  in  the  geometric  proof than  in  the  probabilistic 
            one.  On the other hand, in the probabilistic proof, the complexity of the problem 
            (a —>• с) Л (b —>• d) equals the upper bounds from Problem 342, which are all equal 
            to 2n.  For the quadruple (à —> c) A (b —> d) from the geometric proof, the upper 
            bounds from Problem 342 are still equal to 2n; however, we were able to show only
