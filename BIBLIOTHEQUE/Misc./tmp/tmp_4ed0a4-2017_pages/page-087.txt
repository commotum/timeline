            It is indeed a test:  the measures of the sets are bounded by 1/4+1/8 + -- - ^ 1/2 
            (the first one), 1/8 + 1/16 + -- - ^ 1/4 (the second one), etc.  The deficiency function 
            for this combined test is at least dl — i for every i, where d1 is the deficiency function 
            for ith test.                                                                □
                The deficiency  function  can  be  considered  as  a compact  representation of a 
            decreasing family Un.  We consider a function whose values are natural numbers 
            and Too, and for every finite n the set Un of all u> where the function exceeds n is 
            effectively open (uniformly in n).
                One  can  slightly  extend  this  class  of functions  allowing  non-integer  values. 
            We say that a function и defined on О and having non-negative real values (plus 
            a  special  value  Too)  is  lower  semicomputable  if  for  every  rational  r  the  set 
            {uj I u(cj)  > r} is effectively open uniformly in r.
                The following statement provides  an equivalent definition of lower semicom­
            putable functions on Q.  Let us first consider  basic functions on the Cantor space 
            О that have rational values and depend only on some finite prefix of the argument. 
            To specify a basic function, we say how many input bits it needs to read (the length 
            of the prefix)  and provide a table that specifies the output value for every combi­
            nation of input bits.  If a basic function reads m bits, this table will consist of 2TO 
            rational numbers.  Such a table  (and a basic function that corresponds to it) is a 
            finite object, so we may speak about computable sequence of basic functions.
                Theorem 40.  The following properties of a function v with non-negative real 
            values  (Too  is also allowed)  are equivalent:
                (a)  v  is lower semicomputable;
                (b)  v  is  a pointwise supremum of a computable sequence of basic functions;
                (c)  v  is  a  pointwise  limit  of a  non-decreasing  computable  sequence  of basic 
           functions',
                (d)  v  is  a  sum  of a  series formed  by  a  computable  sequence  of non-negative 
            basic functions.
                Proof.  The two latter properties are equivalent since the sum and the differ­
            ence of two basic functions are basic functions.
                To convert the supremum into a limit, note that the maximum of a finite set 
            of basic functions is a basic function.
                It remains to show that the first property is equivalent to others (for example, 
            the second one).  Let v = sup{ Vi.  Note that supf Vi(uj) > r if and only if Vi(u>) > r 
            for some i.  This guarantees that the set {to  \ v(co)  > r}  is  (uniformly)  effectively 
            open.
                For  the  other  direction,  if  for  each  rational  r  we  can  effectively  enumerate 
            intervals  where  u{u>)  >  r,  then  и  is  the  pointwise  supremum  of an  enumerable 
            set of basic functions that are equal to r inside the corresponding intervals and 0 
            otherwise.                                                                   □
               Now we can give the following definition of a randomness test (without the in­
            tegrality requirement and switching to the exponential scale):  a probability-bounded 
            randomness test with respect to a computable measure p on fl is a lower semicom­
            putable non-negative function и such that
                                        p({tv I u(co) > c}) < 1/c
