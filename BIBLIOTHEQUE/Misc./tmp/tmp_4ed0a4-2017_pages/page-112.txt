                                                      4.6.    PROPERTIES OF PREFIX COMPLEXITY                                                        97
                          To prove a better upper bound for prefix complexity, we may consider a con­
                    verging series                                          E 1
                                                                                  n log  n
                    (To prove its convergence, compare it with the corresponding integral.)  Using this 
                    series, we obtain the inequality K (n) < logn + 2 log log n + 0(1) or (for strings)
                                                             K(x) < l(x) + 2 log l(x) + 0(1)
                    (for the alternative proof of this inequality, see p. 84).
                          Using the series X) l/(n log n(log logn)2), ^  l/(n logn log log n(log log logn)2), 
                    etc., we can improve the bound further.
                          Now we prove the inequality relating the prefix complexity of a pair to prefix 
                    complexities of its components.
                          Theorem 60.
                                                            K(x,y)^K(x) + K(y) + 0( 1).
                          Just as in the case of plain complexity, we define K(x,y) as the complexity of 
                   the string [x, y] where (x, y) t-t [x, y] is a computable injective encoding of pairs of 
                   binary strings.  The complexity of a pair does depend on the choice of the encoding; 
                   switching to another computable injective encoding changes complexity by at most 
                   an additive constant.  Indeed, the translation between any two computable injective 
                   encodings is an algorithmic transformation.
                          PROOF.  Consider the function m! defined as
                                                                   m!{[x, y\) = m{x)m{y).
                   Here x and y are binary strings, [x, y\ is the encoding of the pair, and m stands for 
                   the a priori probability.  If z is not an encoding of any pair, we let m'(z) = 0.
                          The function m! is lower semicomputable  (take the product of lower bounds 
                   for m(x) and m(y) as a lower bound for m{x)m{y)).  Furthermore, we have
                         ^m'(z) = ^m'([x,y]) = ^m(x)m(y) = ^  m(x) ^m (y) <1-1 = 1.
                                              x,y                      x,y
                   Thus m! is a lower semicomputable semimeasure.  Comparing m! with the a priori 
                   probability,  we obtain the inequality m'([x,y])  <  cm([x,y])  for some constant  c. 
                   Hence
                                                           K([x,y])^K(x) + K(y) + 0( 1).
                   The theorem is proved.                                                                                                            □
                           1011 Prove that the sum                        m([x, y]) differs from m{x) by at most a constant
                   factor (in both directions).  Prove a similar statement for maxy m(x, y).
                           102 Let / : N —> N be a strictly increasing computable function.  Prove that
                   the value J2im(k)\f(n) < к < f(n + 1)} differs from m(n) at most by a constant 
                   factor  (in  both directions).  (So  if we  split  the  series  J2nm(n)                                           grouPs  in a 
                   computable way, the sums of the groups form essentially the same series!)
                          Let us prove now Theorem 60 using decompressors.  It turns out that we need 
                   to use prefix-free (and not prefix-stable) decompressors.
                          Let  us prove that  K'([x,y])  <  K'{x) + K'{y) + 0(1).  Let D be an optimal 
                   prefix-free  decompressor  used  in  the  definition  of K'.  Define  a  new  prefix-free
