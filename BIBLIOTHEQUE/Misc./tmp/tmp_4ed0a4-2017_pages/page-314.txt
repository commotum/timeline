                            9.13.  CHANGE IN  THE  MEASURE  AND  RANDOMNESS              301
                 277  Give a corresponding example.
                (Hint:  Consider two measures that are uniform in the left half of the Cantor 
            space and differ significantly in the right half.)
                 278 Prove that in fact for this  argument we do  not  need Martin-Löf ran- 
            domness It is enough to know that cj is computably random with respect to both
            measures  (assuming that  both  measures  are  non-zero  on  all  Ц  and  conditional
            probabilities are well defined).
                This proof has an interesting game interpretation.  Assume that there are two 
            bookmakers who take bets for the same (sequence of) events, but who have different 
            ideas about their probabilities.  Each event has two possible outcomes 0 and 1:  the 
            first  bookmaker thinks that the probability of 1  is p (and the probability of 0 is 
            q — 1 — p) and therefore returns the bets on 1  [0] with coefficients 1/p [1/ç];  and 
            the second bookmaker does the same for probabilities p' and q'.  The probabilities 
            P)Ç)P/)Ç/ таУ be different for different events.
                (Note also that we assume that the bookmakers are altruistic; a more practical 
            bookmaker would use coefficients Co and C\ such that 1/co + l/ci  > 1.)
                Now assume that we are allowed to play with both bookmakers at the same 
            time, having a separate account for each (so we cannot use money from one book­
            maker to make bets with the other one).  In this language the argument  above 
            shows that if all p, ç,p/, q1 are separated from 0 and the sum YliP ~ P')2 ls infinite 
            (for the sequence of events),  then we can achieve unbounded capital in  (at least) 
            one of the games for sure (for every sequence of outcomes).
                How do we achieve this?  Assume that in the first game our current  capital 
            is  и,  in  the second game our capital is v,  and the  (assumed)  probabilities of the 
            outcomes are p,q (in the first game) and p\q'  (in the second one).  Let us split и 
            between two bets in the proportion that brings us (p + p')u/2p for outcome 1 and 
            (q + ql)u/2q for outcome 0.  (It is easy to check that these bets are valid, i.e., the 
            expected value of capital after the game according to the (p, ^-distribution is u.) 
            In the second game capital v becomes (p + p/)u/2p/ (for outcome 1) or (q-\-q')v/2q' 
            (for outcome 0).  Let us track the product of capitals in both games.  It is multiplied 
            either by (p + p/)2/4pp/ or (q + q')2/^qq'■  The inequality between arithmetic and 
            geometric means (the concavity of the logarithm function) guarantees that in both 
            cases the product increases.  Taking the logarithm and estimating the increase, we 
            note that for p^q^p'^q' separated from 0 and for the case Ylip ~ p')2  —  +°° the 
            product of the capitals tends to infinity, so at least for one of the games the capital 
            is unbounded.
                In other words, we have constructed two martingales (with respect to two mea­
            sures), and they have the following property:  For every sequence where conditional 
            probabilities for both measures are separated from 0 and 1 and the differences of 
            probabilities  have  infinite  sum  of squares,  at  least  one  of the  martingales  is  un­
            bounded.
                9.13.2.  The  Law  of Large  Numbers  for  variable  probabilities.  The
            SLLN says that for every p G  (0,1) and for the corresponding measure Bp  (inde­
            pendent trials with success probability p) the set of sequences with limit frequency 
            p has measure 1 (and its complement, the set of sequences where the limit does not 
            exist or is different from p, is a null set).
