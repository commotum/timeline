                     416                                             13.  INFORMATION  AND  LOGIC
                            If the formula Ф —>• 0 is true in the root world, the empty string A belongs to 
                     АГФ_>.© and we output Л.
                            Now let  us  assume  that  Ф  —>  0  is  false  in  the  root  world.  Then  (by  the 
                     definition of implication  in Kripke models)  there exists some world и where Ф is 
                     true and 0 is false.  Let us choose some big length / (much bigger than the length 
                     of r)  assigned to u.  We know that  program r on every random string of length 
                     /  terminates and produces some element of Xq.  However, we do not know which 
                     strings of length / are random and which are not.  So we apply r (concurrently) to 
                     all strings of length /.  If some string s appears more that 2Z/2 times as r’s output, 
                     then we can be sure that  s  belongs to Xq.  Indeed,  the number of non-random 
                     strings of length / is much smaller than 2Z/2, so s should be also an output of r for 
                     some random input.  Therefore, s belongs to Xq C Xp^©.
                            Let  us  try  to  prove  that  there  is  a string s  that  has  many  (more than  2Z/2) 
                     preimages.  Let x be a random string of length /,  and let s be the output of r on 
                     input x.  The complexity of s does not exceed (up to a logarithmic term) the sum 
                     of lengths of x and r, so it is significantly less than 21.  Moreover, s belongs to Xq, 
                     so  s equals either 0£ or  l[y,z]  where t,y,z are random strings of allowed lengths. 
                     Therefore, the lengths of t,y, z cannot exceed /.  (If these strings are longer than /, 
                     they should be much longer due to the choice of lengths and, being random, they 
                     should have large complexity compared to /.)  For t (if the output has form 0£) we 
                     know more:  the length of t should be strictly less than I, since t comes from a world 
                     where 0 is true, and this world differs from и (recall that 0 is false in и).  So the 
                     length of t does not exceed //10.  For у and z (if the output has form 1 [y, z]) we also 
                     have additional information:  у and z come from incomparable worlds, so they have 
                     different lengths.  Therefore, at most one of them can have length I, and the other 
                     one should be short:  either the length of у or the length of z does not exceed //10. 
                     If we knew that both у and z always have lengths at most //10, we could conclude 
                     that the set of all outputs of p on random inputs of length / has cardinality much 
                     less than 2Z/2, so some element has a lot of preimages (more than 2Z/2).
                            Since we cannot guarantee this  (that one of strings у and z can have length 
                     /),  this argument does not work.  Still we can save something from our reasoning. 
                     There  are  two  possibilities:  either  (1)  some  s  has  more  that  2Ч2  preimages,  or 
                     (2)  there exists у such that for more than  21!2  inputs x  of length /  the program 
                     r outputs an element of the form 1 [y,z\ or 1 [z,y\  for that у and some z of length 
                     /.   (The values of z can be different for different  inputs.)  In the second case the 
                     string у must be a random string from some world incomparable with u.  Indeed, 
                     at least one of the inputs that are transformed by r into 1 [y, z] or 1 [z, y] is random, 
                     so the output should belong to AT©.  That is,  у and z are random and belong to 
                     incomparable worlds.  The string z comes from world и (because z has length /); 
                     therefore у comes from some world incomparable with u.
                            Let us summarize our findings.  We apply r to all strings of length / and find 
                     either s or у with the properties described.  In the first case (some s has a lot of 
                     preimages) we know what to do:  s belongs to Xq С Хф_».©.  In the second case we 
                     obtain a random string у from some world v that is incomparable with u.  It may 
                     happen that  Ф  —>  0  is true in v;  then we are done.  If not,  there exists a world 
                     щ  above v where Ф is true and 0 is false.  We can repeat our argument for щ 
                     and get either some element of Xq or a random string from some worlds Vi that is 
                     incomparable with щ.  Note that v\ cannot be below v, since in this case it would
