          Theorem 253.  Let к < n be two integers, and let to > t\ > • • • > tk be a strictly 
       decreasing sequence of integers such that to ^ n and tk — 0; let m be the complexity 
       of this sequence.  Then there exists a string x of complexity к + О (log n) + 0(m) and 
       length n+0(logn)+0(m) for which the boundary curve of Px coincides with the line 
       (0, to)-(l,ti)— ■ ■ -(k,tk)  with O(logn) + О(m)-precision:  the distance between the 
       set Px and the set T = {{i,j) \ (i < k) => (j > t{)} is bounded by O(logn) + 0(m).
          (We say  that  the  distance  between  two  sets  P  and  Q  is  at  most  e  if  P  is 
       contained in e-neighborhood of Q and vice versa.)
          P r o o f.  For  every  i  in  the  range  0 ■■■ к  we  list  all  the  sets  of complexity  at 
       most i and size at most 2ti.  For a given i the union of all these sets is denoted by 
       Si.  It  contains at most  2l+ti  elements.  (Here and later we omit constant factors 
       and factors polynomial in n when estimating cardinalities,  since they correspond 
       to  O(logn)  additive  terms  for  lengths  and  complexities.)  Since  the  sequence  t{ 
       strictly  decreases  (this  corresponds  to  slope  —1  in  the  picture),  the  sums  i + U 
       do not increase, therefore each Si  has at most  2to — 2n elements.  Therefore, the 
       union of all Si also has at most 2n elements (up to a polynomial factor, see above). 
       Therefore, we can find a string of length n  (actually n + O(logn))  that does not 
       belong to any Si.  Let x be a first such string in some order (e.g., in lexicographic 
       order).
          By construction, the set Px lies above the curve determined by ti.  So we need 
       to estimate the complexity of x and prove that Px follows the curve (i.e., that T is 
       contained in the neighborhood of Px).
          Let us start with the upper bound for the complexity of x.  The list of all objects 
       of complexity at most к plus the full table of their complexities have complexity 
       k + O(logfc), since it is enough to know к and the number of terminating programs 
       of length at most к.  Except for this list, we need to know the sequence to,... ,tk 
       whose complexity is m.
          For the lower bound, the complexity of x cannot be less than к since all the 
       singletons of this complexity were excluded (via Tk).
          It remains to be shown that for every i ^ к we can put x into a set A of com­
       plexity i (or slightly bigger) and size 2li  (or slightly bigger).  For this we enumerate
