                                       4.6.  PROPERTIES  OF  PREFIX  COMPLEXITY                               99
               The domain of D coincides with that of D,  hence D'  is prefix free.  Let p be a 
              shortest description of x with respect to D.  Then l(p) = K'(x) and therefore p is 
              a description of the string [x,K'{x)\ with respect to D'.  Thus
                                            KD.{[x,K'{x)}) ^l{p) = K'(x).
                   Is  the theorem proven?  There is one subtle point in the argument.  We have 
              proved the theorem for the complexity К', defined via prefix-free decompressors.  If 
              we substitute К for K' in the equality K'{:r, K'(x)) = K'(x) +0(1), its right-hand 
              side will change by an additive constant.  The similar statement for the left-hand 
              side is not straightforward, as K' has two occurrences there, and the second one is 
              inside the argument.  But at least we have K(x,K'(x)) = K(x) + 0(1).
                   To finish the proof,  it  remains to show that the function K(x,n)  changes at 
              most by a constant, as n changes by 1.  This easily follows from the computability 
              of mappings [x, n]        [x, n + 1]  and [x, n]     [x, n — 1].                                □
                   It is instructive to prove Theorem 61 using the a priori probability.  Let m(x) 
              be the a priori probability of x.  Define the function m! as
                                          m'([x, &]) =      Гк  if 2~k < m(x);
                                                              0   otherwise.
              This function is lower semicomputable:  given x and k, we generate lower bounds 
              for m(x) and output 0 until we find that 2~k < m(x), and then we output 2~k.
                   For every fixed x the sum of m'([x, к]) over all к is a geometric series formed 
              by  powers  of 2.  Therefore this  sum  is  less  than  2m(x)  (the  largest  term of the 
              series is less than m(x)).  Therefore, the sum of m'([x, &]) over all x and к is finite. 
              Comparing m'([x, &]) and the a priori probability of [x, к], we conclude that
                                                   m(x,k) ^ 2-fc+0(1) 
              if 2~k < m(x).  Taking the logarithms, we see that
                                                    K(x,k) ^k + 0( 1)
              whenever 2~k < m(x).  The latter inequality holds for к = —[\ogm(x)\ + 1 and 
              thus we have
                                        K(x, -Llogm(x)J + 1) < K{x) + 0(1).
              It  remains to recall that  the function K(x,n)  changes at most by a constant,  as 
              n changes by 1.  The second proof of Theorem 61  (in the non-trivial direction)  is 
              finished.
                    105  This argument proves a bit more:  K(x, и) ^ u+0( 1) whenever K(x) ^ u. 
              How do we derive this inequality from Theorem 61 (from its statement and not from 
              its proof)?
                   We proceed now  to  the  algorithmic  properties  of the  function  K(x).  Like 
              plain complexity, prefix complexity is upper semicomputable but not computable. 
              Moreover, there is no computable non-trivial (= unbounded) lower bound for K(x). 
              Indeed, since K(x) ^ 2C(x) + 0(1), every non-trivial lower bound of К would yield 
              a non-trivial lower bound of C.
                   Recall that the plain Kolmogorov complexity C(x) can be defined as the small­
              est upper semicomputable function к such that the cardinality of the set {x \ k(x) < 
              n} is 0(2n) for all n (Theorem 8, p. 19).  Here is a similar statement for the prefix 
              complexity:
