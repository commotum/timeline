                One may define disjunction in a different way.  Imagine a teacher who gives an 
            exam with two questions and says that for a passing grade it is enough to answer 
            one of them.  Assume that the teacher gets a student’s paper where both questions 
            are answered, but only one answer is correct.  Usually it is still enough to pass the 
            exam.  This corresponds to the following formal definition:
                                    XVY = {[x, y] I x G X or y G Y}.
            We call this operation pseudo-disjunction.  Its complexity is the same as for dis­
            junction (up to 0 (1), as usual), but these two problems are essentially different (see 
            below).
                 333 Prove that C(XvY) = C(X V Y) + 0(1).
                Yet another (intermediate) interpretation of disjunction will be the union of X 
            and Y ; in this version we are required to give a correct answer but are not obliged 
            to specify which question we are trying to answer.
                The conditional complexity C{y\x) can also be understood as the complexity 
            of some problem.  Informally, we consider the problem  “transform x to y".  More 
            formally,  this problem can be defined as {x}  —>  {г/},  where X —ï Y  (for any two 
            problems X and Y) is the set of all programs that convert every solution to X into 
            some solution to Y.
                Here we fix some programming language where programs (as well as their inputs 
            and outputs) are binary strings.  Let us denote by \p]{x) the output of program p on 
            input x.  If the computation of p on x does not terminate, then \p](x) is undefined. 
            We assume that the programming language is universal (every computable function 
            can be represented as a program).  Moreover, we assume that it allows a computable 
            translation from any other programming language (this property is called the Gödel 
            property, see [184]).  Then we let
                     X —> Y = {p I Vx (x G X  =Ф-  [p](x) is defined and [p](x) G Y)}.
            In fact we have already used this approach.  In section 6.4 we defined C(x     n) 
            as  the  minimal complexity of a program that  produces x on every input  к such 
            that к ^ n.  In our new notation, C(x     n)  = C({m G N | m ^ n) -» {x}).  Our 
            initial example, the complexity of {x} —> {y}, is equal to the conditional complexity 
            C(y |x) + 0 (1).
                Some theorems of Chapter 12 can be now stated in terms of problem complexity.
                For example, the solutions to  (x —> y) A (y —> x)  (we write  {x}  as x to sim­
            plify notation)  are pairs  [гг, г;]  where program и transforms x to у and program v 
            transforms у to x.  As we have seen,  the complexity of this problem is equal to 
            max(C(x|y), C(y\x)) + 0(logO(x,y)).
                Here is one more example.  The solutions for the problem (x —> z) A (y —> z) 
            are pairs of programs  [гг, v] such that и maps x to z and v maps у to 2.  We have 
            shown that the minimal possible complexity of such a pair is
                                max(C(z\x),C(z\y)) + 0(logC(x, y, z)).
                 334  Find the complexity of the problem а —> (b —ï c) where a, b, c are strings
            (singletons).
                (Hint:  This problem is equivalent to (a Ab)   c.)
