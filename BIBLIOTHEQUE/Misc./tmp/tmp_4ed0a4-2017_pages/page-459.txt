                  •  there exists a set A G A such that d(x\ A) ^ ß\

                Historical remarks.  The existence of strings of length n and complexity about к 
            that are not (к, n — к + 0(logn))-stochastic was first proved in [60, Theorem IV.2]. 
            The study of possible shapes of the set Qx was initiated by V. V’yugin [211,  212] 
            using direct arguments (and not the relation between Qx and Px).  The descriptions 
            of possible shapes of Qx with accuracy О (logn) (Problem 366) is due to [203], where 
            reduction to the set Px is used.  Problems 367, 368, and 369 go back to [203, 204].
                                     14.6.  Minimal hypotheses
               Fix a string x.  We have associated with x the set  Px  consisting of all pairs 
            (a,ß) such that x has an (a*/^-description.  Those descriptions were considered as 
            “statistical hypotheses to explain x”.  What do they look like?  It turns out that we 
            can identify a more or less explicit class of models such that every model reduces in 
            a sense to a model from that class.  This class arises from the proof of Theorem 254.
               Let I be some number greater than C(x).  Then the list of all strings of com­
            plexity at most I contains x.  Fix some enumeration of this list (an algorithm that 
            generates all these strings; each appears only once).  We assume that this algorithm 
            is simple:  its complexity is O(logZ).  Let Ni  be the number of elements in the list. 
            Consider the binary representation of Ni, i.e., the sum
                          Ni = 2Sl + 2S2 + • • • + 2s*,  where s\  > S2 > ■ • ■ > st.
            According to this decomposition, we may split the list itself into groups:  first 2Sl 
            elements, next 2S2 elements, etc.  The string x belongs to one of these groups.  This 
           group  (the corresponding finite set)  can be considered  as a hypothesis  for x.  In 
           this way we get a family of models for x:  each I > C(x) produces some hypothesis, 
           denoted BXii in the sequel.
               The following two  theorems  prove  the  promised  properties  of these  models. 
           First,  they are  minimal,  i.e.,  they lie on the border of the set  Px.  Second,  each 
           model for x reduces in a sense to one of them.
               Theorem 261.  Assume that x belongs to the part Bxj  of size 2s  in this con­
            struction.  Then this part is an ((I — s) * s)-description of x  and the point (I — s, s) 
            is  on  the  boundary of Px.  (As usual,  the exact statement needs a logarithmic cor­
            rection:  this part is an ((I — s + 0 (\ogl)) *s)-description of x and the corresponding 
           point is in the О (log /)-neighborhood of the boundary of Px.)
               Proof.  To specify this part, it is enough to know its size and the number of 
           elements enumerated before it,  i.e.,  it  is  enough to  know  s,  I  and  all  bits  of Ni 
           except s last bits (i.e., I — s bits).  Also we need to know the enumerating algorithm 
           itself, but it has logarithmic complexity (as we assumed).  Therefore the complexity 
           of the part is I — s + O(logZ), and the number of elements is 2s, as we have claimed.
               If the point (I — s,s) were far from the boundary and were in Px together with 
           more than logarithmic neighborhood,  then the string x would have much better 
           two-part descriptions  (with the same or even smaller total length and with larger 
           size),  so Theorem 254(d) would imply that the string x appears in the list earlier 
            (more than 2s  elements follow x in the enumeration),  which is impossible in our 
           construction.                                                                □
