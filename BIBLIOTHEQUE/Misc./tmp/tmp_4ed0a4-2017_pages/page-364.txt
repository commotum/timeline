                 C onjecture.  For every two strings x and y there is an incompressible string 
            и of length C(x,y)  that is equivalent (with logarithmic accuracy)  to the pair (x,y), 
            such that the C(x)-bit prefix of и is equivalent to x and the C(y)-bit suffix of и is 
             equivalent to у  (with the same accuracy).
                However this conjecture is wrong.  To see this, notice that the conjecture implies 
            that for every two strings x and у there exists a string z (the common part of the 
            said prefix and suffix) such that
                                             C(z\x) — 0,
                                             C(z\y) = 0,
                                               C(z) = I{x:y)
            (up to logarithmic error terms).  Informally, these equalities mean that the string 
            z represents the common information in x and y.  We will show that for some pair 
            x, у there is no such z.
                 307  Show that if for some strings x and у such a 2 exists, then the conjecture
            is true for these x and y.
                There are several counterexamples to the conjecture.  The simplest counterex­
            ample  (from Muchnik’s paper  [134])  is the following one.  We will construct two 
            strings  x  and  у  of complexity  2n  that  have  n  bits  of mutual  information  (with 
            logarithmic precision).  Thus the complexity of the pair  (x,y) will be close to 3n. 
            Additionally, there will be no string z of complexity n such that C(z | x) and C(z | y) 
            are negligible (with accuracy O(logn)).
                How can we do this?  Let  us first  rewrite the  latter two  conditions for  z  as 
            C{x\z)  = n and C(y\z) — n.  Thus we are looking for strings x and у both of 
            complexity 2n that have n bits of mutual information and for which there is no 
            string z such that C(z) и n, C(x\z) « n, and C(y\z) « n.  The following theorem 
            guarantees the existence of strings x and у with these properties and even with a 
            stronger property:  There is no z such that C(z), C(x\z), and C(y\z) are less than 
            l.ln.
                Theorem 223.  For every n there are strings x and у such that
                   C(x) — 2n + O(logn), C(y) = 2n + O(logn), I(x:y) = n + O(logn), 
            and such that there is no z  of complexity less  than 1.1 n  with C(x\z)  <  1.1 n and 
            C(y I z) < 1.1 n.
                P r o o f.  Let  us  show  that  there  exists  a  pair  x,y  of strings,  each  of length 
            2n + 2, such that
                   •  C(x) ^ 2n,
                   •  C(y) ^ 2n,
                   •  C(x, y) ^ 3n, and
                   •  there is no z with C(z) < l.ln, C(x\z) < l.ln, C(y\z) < l.ln.
            Indeed,  the  first  condition is violated by less than quarter of all  pairs  (the total 
            number of x’s is 22n+2, and only 22n of them have complexity less than 2n).  Sim­
            ilarly,  the second condition is violated by less than quarter of all pairs.  The third 
            condition is violated by less than 23n pairs, which is a negligible quantity compared 
            to the total number 24n+4 of all pairs.  Finally, the fourth condition is violated by 
            less than 2l ln x 2l ln pairs for every fixed z.  As there are less than 2l ln different
