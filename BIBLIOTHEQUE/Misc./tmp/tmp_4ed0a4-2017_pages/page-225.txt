        212          6.  GENERAL  SCHEME  FOR COMPLEXITIES
          (Hint [16]:  For every N the frequencies in the initial segment of length N form 
        a lower semicomputable semimeasure  (it was a measure for total sequences);  the 
        construction used in the proof of Theorem 133 allows us to find an upper bound 
        for the limit frequencies that is a O'-lower-semicomputable semimeasure.  Then we 
        apply Theorem 136.)
