                                                                 8.5.    FORBIDDEN  SUBSTRINGS                                                         251
                    Let us make it weaker:  replace 2a by 2, and include all к ^ N — 1 in the sum.  Then 
                    we get
                                                              <!')> MI)( 1-  £   J ) .
                                                                                    V       k^N-l Z           /
                    The series in the right-hand side converges; therefore for large enough N the factor 
                    in the right-hand side (in parentheses)  is at least 2/3_1,  and the induction step is 
                    finished.  (Note that we applied the inductive assumption only to sets of size less 
                    than |/|, so there is no circle in our argument.)
                           8.5.5.             Complex subsequences.  Now we want to translate the result of the 
                    previous section into complexity language and prove that there exist  a sequence 
                    that has complex subsequences and not only substrings (as before).
                           What kind of statement can we get?  Can we guarantee that every subsequence 
                    of (large enough) length m has complexity at least am for some a < 1?  (A similar 
                    result was true for substrings.)  Of course not—one can select a subsequence that 
                    consists only of zeros  (or ones).  But in this case the set of indices may have high 
                    complexity.  So we should take into account both the complex^ of the set of indices 
                    and the complexity of the subsequence.
                           Indeed  a result  of this  type  can be  proven,  as we  saw  in Problem  145  (and 
                    Theorem 94,  p.  151,  for  the  case  of uniform  measure):  if a sequence  cu  is  ML- 
                    random with respect to the uniform measure, then
                                                                      K(Fcj(F))^\F\-c
                    for some c and for all finite sets F.
                           But now we want to prove a different result [158]:
                           Theorem 162.  Let a £ (0.1)  be a real number.  There exist a sequence u>  and 
                    a constant N such that
                                                                   nvc\xC(F,u>(F)\t) ^   ot\F\ 
                    for every F that contains at least N elements.
                          To understand better the meaning of this result, let us consider the following 
                    corollary:  for every finite set F of size at least N there exists t £ F such that
                                                             C(u(F)\F,t)^a\F\-2C(F\t)
                    (the constant 2 can be made smaller, but we want a simple statement).  Omitting 
                    t in the left-hand side, we may conclude also that for every finite F the inequality
                                                          C(u(F)\F) ^ a\F\-2mzxC(F\t)
                    holds.
                          This implies that all substrings are complex.  Indeed, if F is an interval, then 
                    the complexity C(F\t) is logarithmic for every t £ F and can be absorbed by a small 
                    change in a.  Moreover, this gives us also a two-dimensional version:  If indices form 
                    a planar grid  and  F is a rectangle,  the complexity C(F\t)  is also  logarithmic  in 
                    the size of F,  and the same trick works.  So we get the statement of Problem 251 
                    (p.  248)  as a corollary.
                          Note also that this corollary shows that ML-random sequences do not have the 
                    required property and LL is essential here.
