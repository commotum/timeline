                               CHAPTER 10
            Inequalities for entropy,  complexity, and size
                       10.1.  Introduction and summary
           The first publication of Kolmogorov in which the definition of complexity was 
        given  is  the  paper  “Three  approaches  to  the  quantitative  definition  of informa­
        tion”  [78].  The three approaches mentioned there are combinatorial, probabilistic, 
        and algorithmic.
           The algorithmic approach measures the amount of information in a message 
        by  its  Kolmogorov complexity  (as we  call  it  now—of course,  this  name was  not 
        used  by  Kolmogorov  himself).  Using  the  probabilistic  approach,  we  consider  a 
        message as one of the possible values of some random variable, and we measure the 
        Shannon entropy of this random variable.  But Kolmogorov started the paper with 
        the combinatorial approach, making the following (trivial) observation:  If there are 
        N different messages that can be transmitted, we need log N bits to specify which 
        of the messages is transmitted.  (If we need to guess one of N objects, we need to 
        ask logiV yes-or-no questions.)
           We have already mentioned some results that relate these three approaches.  For 
        example, Theorem 8 (p. 19) related the combinatorial and algorithmic approaches 
        and refined the following (absurd, if understood literally) statement,  “a string x has 
        complexity at most n if and only if x belongs to the set of at most 2n elements”. 
        Another example is that the results of Section 7.3 relate Kolmogorov complexity 
        and Shannon entropy.
           In this chapter, following [64,  157], we establish more formal connections be­
        tween the three approaches and restrict ourselves to a rather specific class of state­
        ments:  linear inequalities for entropy and complexity (and corresponding combina­
        torial statements).
           Let  x\,... ,xn  be binary  strings.  For every non-empty set  I  C  {1, 2,... ,n} 
        of indices,  consider the tuple xj  made of all X{  with i  €  I.  We are interested in 
        the Kolmogorov complexity of this tuple.  For example, for n = 3, we have seven 
        possible tuples, and we get a list of seven complexities:
              C(xi), C(x2), C(x3), C(xi,x2), C(xi, x3), C(x2, x3), C(xi,x2,x3).
        Let us give several examples of linear inequalities where these complexities appear:
             •  C(x\,x2) ^ C(xi) + C(x2) + O(logiV);
             •  C(xi,x2,x3) ^ C(xi) + C(x2,x3) + O(logiV);
             •  C(xi,x2,x3) + C(xi) ^ C(xi,x2) + C(xi,x3) + O(logiV);
             •  2C(xi,x2,x3)  ^ C(xi,x3) + C(x2,x3) + C(xux2) + O(logiV)
        (we assume here that x\,x2,x3 are strings of length at most N).
