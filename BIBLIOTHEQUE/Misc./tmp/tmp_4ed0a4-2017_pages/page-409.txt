                                   12.12.  MINIMAL  SUFFICIENT STATISTICS                    399
             is bounded by
                    •  0{L) for I ^ y/L-
                    •  0(lVZ) for I ^ y/L
             (this  is  the  bound  obtained  in  the  proof).  Now  we  have  to  consider  separately 
            the case of large and small  Vb>.  If Vb>  is  large  and  contains  more than  \J\Ub>\ 
             (i.e.,  more  than  2p/2)  elements,  then  the  number  of covered  pairs  for  this  B'  is 
            at  most  2p/2|Vß'|.  The sum over all B'  of this type is bounded by 0 (2p/222n2r) 
             (since the set of size 22n is covered by at most 2r  layers).  Now consider small Vb>'s 
            that contain at most  л/Щв11 elements.  For them Ub>  x  Vb>  covers at most 0(2P) 
            elements, and for 2q  different B'  we have in total 0 (2p+q)  pairs.
                 Therefore, if p + q < 2>n — O(logn) and (p/2) + 2n + r < 3n — О (log n), then a 
            random pair (A, В) cannot be served by any of B'.  (We should note also that the 
            set  of pairs that  are served can be enumerated if we know n,p,q,r,  i.e.,  O(logn) 
            bits of advice.)  The second inequality can be rewritten as p + 2r < 2n; it is a bit 
            worse than the bound p + r < 2n that appeared in our first argument, but we still 
            get the bound 0 (r), as the theorem claims.
                 This finishes the third proof of Theorem 237.
                 Remark.  The geometric proof provides a simple set of pairs where most of the 
            pairs satisfy the statement of the theorem.  So it gives a stochastic (in the sense of 
            Section 14.2) pair with required properties.
                The same result can be achieved by some modification of the second  (proba­
            bilistic) proof.  We have said that a mapping is covered if something is true for all 
            pairs (of certain type).  Let us weaken this restriction and say that U is covered if 
            the same condition is true at least for the half of the pairs.  To prove the existence 
            of U that is not covered, we can use the following (trivial)  probability bound.  If 
            each of 2 k independent events has probability less than 1/16, then more than 2 k~l 
            events happen with probability at most 22  • (1/16)2  /2 = 2“2  .  So we may replace 
            1/2 by 1/16 in the argument and continue the proof as before.  In this way we get 
            a simple set U where half of the elements have the required properties.
                 (Another approach is also possible.  Instead  of considering  S',  T and  all  the 
            admissible triples in parallel, one can prove that with high probability for a random 
            U the fraction of pairs when (4) is true is small.  These small fractions and small 
            probabilities are then added for all triples from M.)
