            position of length n), we use 2^-1^n for some constant ß G  (a, 1).  Then we need 
            to check that for suitable ß the conditions of the LL are satisfied.
                Let I be the position of some event (the interval where we look for a forbidden 
            string).  The neighbor events happen at intervals J that overlap with I (all other 
            events are independent).  The bounds Si  depend on the lengths,  so we group all 
            possible intervals J according to their lengths.  There exist n + к — 1 intervals J of 
            length к that have a non-zero overlap with a given interval I of length n.  Each of 
            them adds a factor (1 —          on the right-hand side of the condition of the LL,
            and in total we get
                                           (1 — 2^~l^k)n+k~l
            Now we have to multiply these expressions for all k, starting with some N (if we 
            construct a sequence with forbidden substrings of length at least N).  So to apply 
            the LL, we need to prove the inequality
                                2(a-i)n ^ 2^~l)n .     (i _ 2('0-1)fc)n+/c_1. 
                                                   k^N
            (In fact, we included I while considering intervals of length к — n, though we were 
            not obliged to,  but this makes our task only more difficult.)  Now we use a quite 
            rough bound:  we replace n + к — 1 by nk, take nth roots,  and use the Bernoulli 
            inequality.  It remains to prove that
                                        2a-ß ^ 1 - ^ 2  k2iß~1)k. 
                                                    k^N
            The infinite series ^2k k2^ß~l^k converges when ß < 1, and the left-hand side is less 
            than 1 for a < ß, so the inequality is true if N is large enough.
                Let us repeat what we are doing.  First, we take arbitrary ß G (a, 1) and then 
            choose a suitable N that makes the tail of the series small.  Then we apply the 
            LL to an arbitrarily large finite length and show that there exists a string of that 
            length which does not have forbidden strings of length N or more.  (Our bounds 
            work for arbitrary lengths.)  Finally, we use the compactness argument to get an 
            infinite sequence.
                 251  Prove a two-dimensional version of Theorem 157:  one can fill an infinite 
            cell  paper by zeros  and ones in such a way that  every rectangle of large enough 
            area is not forbidden.  (We assume that for every rectangle of area k, at most 2ak 
            forbidden combinations of zeros and ones inside this rectangle are fixed, for some 
            constant a < 1.)
                (Hint:  Similar bounds can be proven, and the LL can be used.)
                8.5.4.  Forbidden subsequences.  In the previous section we considered for­
            bidden substrings, i.e., forbidden combinations of consecutive bits.  But why should 
            the bits be consecutive?  This looks artificial, and we may consider a more general 
            setting, as in [158].  Assume that we have a countable family of Boolean variables 
            and some restrictions;  each of them forbids some combination of values for some 
            variables.  We are interested in a result of the following type:  If the restrictions are 
            not too numerous,  there exists an assignment of Boolean values to all the variables 
            that satisfies all the restrictions.  (In this kind of result, we do not care about exact 
            combinations of values that are forbidden; the only thing we use is that there are 
            not too many restrictions.)
