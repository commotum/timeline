                                                 12.12.   MINIMAL SUFFICIENT STATISTICS                                           397
                           •  strings in WPtq^r(VPjq^r(B,Y), Z) covered by (4), at most 2r x 2P of them 
                              for each triple (p, q, r) € M.
                 In total we get
                                                      2лп~ л + 2n ~ * logn + 2  +р •  M 
                 unsuitable strings, and this number is bounded by 22n~l  (half of all strings) if
                 (*)                                      r + p + log\M\ < 2n — 3
                 for all  (p,q,r) G M (this is our first requirement for M).
                       Now we estimate the number of all quadruples V, W, S, T.  For given p, q, r there 
                 are at most
                                                             (29)з271><2Г = 2 я'2,2т'+г 
                 possibilities for VPiqjr and at most
                                                             (22n)2" X 2P       2 2 n-2q+p
                 possibilities for Wp^ r.  There are at most
                                                            ß2n^22n~2 — 22n22n~2
                 possibilities for 5 and at most
                                                      ^22n^22Tlx2n- 21o6n  _  2(23n/n) + l
                 possibilities  for  T.  The  first  two  bounds  appear with  exponent  \M\  (to  get  the 
                 bound  for  the  total  number  of possibilities  for  V  and  W)\  in  total  we  get  the 
                 following bound for the number of quadruples:
                                         2<j-22n+rx|M|  , 22n-2g+pX\M\ . 22n'22n~2 . 2(23n/n)+1
                 The binary logarithm of this number does not exceed
                                 q ■ 22n+r x |M| + 2n • 29+p x \M\ + 2n • 22n"2 + (23n/n) + 1, 
                 and this is smaller than 23n  (as we need to finish the proof) if 
                 (**)                            2n + r + logg + log\M\ < 3n — 0(1)
                 and
                 (***)                            q + p + logn + log\M\ < 3n — 0(1).
                 (We use that 2a + 2b is equal to 2max(a’6) up to an 0(l)-factor; two other conditions 
                 2n — 2 + log2n < 3n — 0(1) and log(23n/n + 1) < 3n — 0(1) are guaranteed to be 
                 true.)
                       All three conditions (*)-(***) are true if
                                                        p + r <2n — 31ogn — 0(1),
                                                       2n + r < 3n — 4 logn — 0(1), 
                                                        p + q < 3n — 41ogn — 0(1)
                 for all (p, q, r)  G M, since \M\ — 0(n3) in this case.  Let us now define M as the set 
                 of triples satisfying these three inequalities.  We know now that (for this M) there 
                 exists  a mapping U not  covered by any quadruple V, W, S, T.  Now the standard 
                 argument shows that there exists a mapping U of logarithmic complexity (first in 
                 some order) not covered by any quadruple.
                       Take this U and consider the following quadruple V, W,S, T.  Let  {5(-)}  (the 
                 range of 5)  be the set of all 2n-bit strings whose complexity is less than 2n — 2.
