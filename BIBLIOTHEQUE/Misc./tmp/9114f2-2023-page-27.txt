Problem 10. Generator pass-rate: 17.6%. In step 13, the generator attempts
to simplify the equation by combining like terms. It correctly moves and com-
bines the linear terms to the left-hand side, but then mistakenly leaves the
right-hand side untouched. The reward model is fooled by this mistake.

Denali and Nate work for a dog walking business and are paid for each dog they walk. Denali is responsible
for 16 dogs and Nate is responsible for 12 dogs. Under the company’s new policy, they will be assigned
or unassigned new dogs in groups of « dogs. The ratio of Denali’s pay to Nate’s pay would be the same
if Denali started walking 4z more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned
ta Denali. Find 2 ie #0.

FRROR.

Problem 11. Generator pass-rate: 13.4%. The generator attempts to per-
form long division, but in step 16, it forgets to include the leading zeros in the
repeating part of the decimal. The reward model is fooled by this mistake.
