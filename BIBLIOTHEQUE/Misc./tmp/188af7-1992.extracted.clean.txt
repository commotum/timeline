Q-learning (Watkins, 1989) is a simple way for agents to learn how to act optimally i
n controlled Markoviandomains. It amounts to an incremental method for dynamic programming which imposes limited computationaldemands. It works by successively improving its evaluations of the quality of particular actions at particular states.This paper presents and proves in detail a convergence theorem for Q,-learning based on that outlined in Watkins
(1989). We show that Q-learning converges to the optimum action-values with probability 1 so long as all actionsare repeatedly sampled in all states and the action-values are represented discretely. We also sketch extensionsto the cases of non-discounted, but absorbing, Markov environments, and where many Q values can be changedeach iteration, rathe

IntroductionQ-learning (Watkins, 1989) is a form of model-free reinforcement learning. It can also beviewed as a method of asynchronous dynamic programming (DP). It provides agents withthe capability of learning to act optimally in Markovian domains by experiencing
 the con-sequences of actions, without requiring them to build maps of the domains.Learning proceeds similarly to Sutton's (1984; 1988) method of temporal differences(TD): an agent tries an action at a particular state, and evaluates its consequences in termsof the immediate reward or penalty it receives and its estimate
 of the value of the stateto which it is taken. By trying all actions in all states repeatedly, it learns which are bestoverall, judged by long-term discounted reward. Q-learning is a primitive (Watkins, 1989)form of learning, but, as such, it can operate as the basis of far more sophisticated devices.Examples
 of its use include Barto and Singh (1990), Sutton (1990), Chapman and Kael-bling (1991), Mahadevan and Connell (1991), and Lin (1992), who developed it inde-pendently. There are also various industrial applications.This paper presents the proof outlined by Watkins (1989) that Q-learning converges. Sec-tion 2 describes the problem, the method,
 and the notation, section 3 gives an overviewof the proof, and section 4 discusses two extensions. Formal details are left as far as pos-sible to the appendix. Watkins (1989) should be consulted for a more extensive discussionof Q-learning, including its relationship with dynamic programming and TD. See also Werbos(1977).55

280C. WATKINS AND P. DAYAN2. The task for Q-learningConsider a computational agent moving around some discrete, finite world, choosing onefrom a finite collection of actions at every time step. The world constitutes a controlledMarkov process with the agent as a controller. At step n, the agent is equipped to registerthe state xn (€ X) of the world, an can choose its action an (€ 2)1 accordingly. The agentreceives a probabilistic reward rn, whose mean value (RXn (an) depends only on the stateand action, and the state of the world changes probabilistically to yn according to the law:The task facing the agent is that of determining an optimal policy, one that maximizes totaldiscounted expected reward. By discounted reward, we mean that rewards received s stepshence are worth less than rewards received now, by a factor of ys (0 < y < 1). Undera policy T, the value of state x isbecause the agent expects to receive (Rx(r(x)) immediately for performing the action Irecommends, and then moves to a state that is 'worth' V*(y) to it, with probabilityPxy [>(*)]. The theory of DP (Bellman & Dreyfus, 1962; Ross, 1983) assures us that thereis at least one optimal stationary policy T* which is such thatis as well as an agent can do from state x. Although this might look circular, it is actuallywell defined, and DP provides a number of methods for calculating V* and one T*( assum-ing that (Rx(a) and Pxy[a] are known. The task facing a Q, learner is that of determininga f* without initially knowing these values. There are traditional methods (e.g., Sato, Abe& Takeda, 1988) for learning (Rx(a) and Pxy[a] while concurrently performing DP, butany assumption of certainty equivalence, i.e., calculating actions as if the current modelwere accurate, costs dearly in the early stages of learning (Barto & Singh, 1990). Watkins(1989) classes ^-learning as incremental dynamic programming, because of the step-by-step manner in which it determines the optimal policy.For a policy T, define Q, values (or action-values) as:In other words, the 3, value is the expected discounted reward for executing action a atstate x and following policy T thereafter. The object in Q-learning is to estimate the 5,56

^-LEARNING281values for an optimal policy. For convenience, define these as Q*(x, a) = Q**(x, a), Vx, a.It is straightforward to show that V*(x) = maxa Q*(x, a) and that if a* is an action at whichthe maximum is attained, then an optimal policy can be formed as r*(x) = a*. Hereinlies the utility of the Q, values—if an agent can learn them, it can easily decide what itis optimal to do. Although there may be more than one optimal policy or a*, the 5* valuesare unique.In Q-learning, the agent's experience consists of a sequence of distinct stages or episodes.In the nth episode, the agent:• observes its current state xn,• selects and performs an action an,• observes the subsequent state yn,• receives an immediate payoff rn, and• adjusts its Qn-1 values using a learning factor an, according to:whereis the best the agent thinks it can do from state y. Of course, in the early stages of learn-ing, the Q, values may not accurately reflect the policy they implicitly define (the maxi-mizing actions in equation 2). The initial Q, values, Q,0(X, a), for all states and actionsare assumed given.Note that this description assumes a look-up table representation for the Q,n(x, a).Watkins (1989) shows that ^-learning may not converge correctly for other representations.The most important condition implicit in the convergence theorem given below is thatthe sequence of episodes that forms the basis of learning must include an infinite numberof episodes for each starting state and action. This may be considered a strong conditionon the way states and actions are selected—however, under the stochastic conditions ofthe theorem, no method could be guaranteed to find an optimal policy under weaker con-ditions. Note, however, that the episodes need not form a continuous sequence—that isthe y of one episode need not be the x of the next episode.The following theorem defines a set of conditions under which Qn(x, a) - Q*(x, a)as n - o. Define ni(x, a) as the index of the ith time that action a is tried in state x.57

282C. WATKINS AND P. DAYANTheoremGiven bounded rewards \rn\ < (R, learning rates 0 < an < 1, andthen Qn(x, a) - G*(x, a) as n - o, Vx, a, with probability 1.3. The convergence proofThe key to the convergence proof is an artificial controlled Markov process called the action-replay process ARP, which is constructed from the episode sequence and the learning ratesequence an.A formal description of the ARP is given in the appendix, but the easiest way to thinkof it is in terms of a card game. Imagine each episode (xt, at, yt, rt, at,) written on a card.All the cards together form an infinite deck, with the first episode-card next-to-bottomand stretching infinitely upwards, in order. The bottom card (numbered 0) has written onit the agent's initial values Q0(x, a) for all pairs of x and a. A state of the ARP, (x, n),consists of a card number (or level) n, together with a state x from the real process. Theactions permitted in the ARP are the same as those permitted in the real process.The next state of the ARP, given current state (x, n) and action a, is determined as follows.First, all the cards for episodes later than n are eliminated, leaving just a finite deck. Cardsare then removed one at a time from top of this deck and examined until one is found whosestarting state and action match x and a, say at episode t. Then a biased coin is flipped,with probability a, of coming out heads, and 1 - a, of tails. If the coin turns up heads,the episode recorded on this card is replayed, a process described below; if the coin turnsup tails, this card too is thrown away and the search continues for another card matchingx and a. If the bottom card is reached, the game stops in a special, absorbing, state, andjust provides the reward written on this card for x, a, namely Qo(x, a).Replaying the episode on card t consists of emitting the reward, rt , written on the card,and then moving to the next state (yt, t - 1} in the ARP, where yt is the state to whichthe real process went on that episode. Card t itself is thrown away. The next state transitionof the ARP will be taken based on just the remaining deck.The above completely specifies how state transitions and rewards are determined in theARP. Define P^tiyim) [a] and (Rjn)(a) as the transition-probability matrices and expectedrewards of the ARP. Also define:as the probabilities that, for each x, n and a, executing action a at state (x,n) in the ARPleads to state y of the real process at some lower level in the deck.58

Q-LEARNING283As defined above, the ARP is as much a controlled Markov process as is the real pro-cess. One can therefore consider sequences of states and controls, and also optimal dis-counted C* values for the ARP.2 Note that during such a sequence, episode cards are onlyremoved from the deck, and are never replaced. Therefore, after a finite number of actions,the bottom card will always be reached.3.1. LemmasTwo lemmas form the heart of the proof. One shows that, effectively by construction, theoptimal Q, value for ARP state (x, n) and action a is just Qn(x, a). The next shows thatfor almost all possible decks, P^[a] converge to Pxy[a] and Rx(n)(a) converge to Sx(a)as n - o. Informal statements of the lemmas and outlines of their proofs are given below;consult the appendix for the formal statements.Lemma AQn(x, a) are the optimal action values for ARP states (x, n) and ARP actions a.The ARP was directly constructed to have this property. The proof proceeds by backwardsinduction, following the ARP down through the stack of past episodes.Lemma BLemma B concerns the convergence of the ARP to the real process. The first two stepsare preparatory; the next two specify the form of the convergence and provide foundationsfor proving that it occurs.B.1Consider a discounted, bounded-reward, finite Markov process. From any starting statex, the difference between the value of that state under the finite sequence of s actions andits value under that same sequence followed by any other actions tends to 0 as s - o.This follows from the presence of the discount factor which weighs the (s + l)th stateby ys - 0 as s - o.B.2Given any level /, there exists another yet higher level, h, such that the probability canbe made arbitrarily small of straying below l after taking 5 actions in the ARP, startingfrom above h.The probability, starting at level h of the ARP of straying below any fixed level / tendsto 0 as h - o. Therefore there is some sufficiently high level for which s actions canbe safely accommodated, with an arbitrarily high probability of leaving the ARP above /.59

284C. WATKINS AND P. DAYANB.3With probability 1, the probabilities P$[a] and expected rewards (RJ(n)(a) in the ARP con-verge and tend to the transition matrices and expected rewards in the real process as thelevel n increases to infinity. This, together with B.2, makes it appropriate to considerP^\d\ rather than the ARP transition matrices P$^,fy,m)[a], i.e., essentially ignoring thelevel at which the ARP enters state y.The ARP effectively estimates the mean rewards and transitions of the real process overall the episodes. Since its raw data are unbiased, the conditions on the sums and sumsof squares of the learning rates cni(X,a) ensure the convergence with probability one.B.4Consider executing a series of s actions in the ARP and in the real process. If the proba-bilities P^[a] and expected rewards (R(n)(a ) at appropriate levels of the ARP for eachof the actions, are close to Pxy[a] and (Rx(a),Va, x, y, respectively, then the value of theseries of actions in the ARP will be close to its value in the real process.The discrepancy in the action values over a finite number s of actions between the valuesof two approximately equal Markov processes grows at most quadratically with s. So,if the transition probabilities and rewards are close, then the values of the actions mustbe close too.3.2. The theoremPutting these together, the ARP tends towards the real process, and so its optimal Q, valuesdo too. But 3n(a, x) are the optimal Q values for the nth level of the ARP (by Lemma A),and so tend to Q*(x, a).Assume, without loss of generality, that Q0(X, a) < R/(l - y) and that (R > 1.Given e > 0, choose s such thatBy B.3, with probability 1, it is possible to choose / sufficiently large such that forn > l, and Va, x, y,andBy B.2, choose h sufficiently large such that for n > h, the probability, after takings actions, of ending up at a level lower than l is less than min{(e(l - y)/6s(A),(e/3s(s + 1)<R)}. This means that60

^-LEARNING285andwhere the primes on P'(n) and (R'(n} indicate that these are conditional on the level inthe ARP after the sth step being greater than /.Then, for n > h, by B.4, compare the value QARp((x, n), a1,..., as) of taking ac-tions a1, ..., as at state x in the ARP, with Q,(x, a1, ..., as) of taking them in thereal process:3Where, in equation 4, the first term counts the cost of conditions for B.2 not holding,as the cost of straying below / is bounded by 2s<R /(1 - 7). The second term is the cost,from B.4, of the incorrect rewards and transition probabilities.However, by B.1, the effect of taking only s actions makes a difference of less than e/6for both the ARP and the real process. Also since equation 4 applies to any set of ac-tions, it applies perforce to a set of actions optimal for either the ARP or the real proc-ess. ThereforeSo, with probability 1, Qn(x, a) - Q*(x, a) as n - o as required.4. Discussions and conclusionsFor the sake of clarity, the theorem proved above was somewhat restricted. Two par-ticular extensions to the version of ^-learning described above have been used in prac-tice. One is the non-discounted case (7 = 1), but for a Markov process with absorbinggoal states, and the other is to the case where many of the 5 values are updated in eachiteration rather than just one (Barto, Bradtke & Singh, 1991). The convergence result holdsfor both of these, and this section sketches the modifications to the proof that are necessary.A process with absorbing goal states has one or more states which are bound in the endto trap the agent. This ultimate certainty of being trapped plays the role that 7 < 1 playedin the earlier proof, in ensuring that the value of state x under any policy r, Vw(x), isbounded, and that lemma B.1 holds, i.e., that the difference between considering infiniteand finite (s) numbers of actions tends to 0 as s - o.Since the process would always get trapped were it allowed to run, for every state x thereis some number of actions u(x) such that no matter what they are, there is a probabilityp(x) > 0 of having reached one of the goal states after executing those actions. Take61

286C. WATKINS AND P. DAYANu* = maxx{u(x)}, and p* = minx{p(x)} > 0 (since there is only a finite number ofstates). Then a crude upper bound for V*(x) issince in each « * steps the agent earns a reward of less than u *R, and has probability lessthan (1 — p*) of not having been trapped. Similarly, the effect of measuring the rewardafter only ou* steps is less than (1 - p*)*u*® - 0 as j - o, and so an equivalentof lemma B.1 does hold.Changing more than one Q value on each iteration requires a minor modification to theaction replay process ARP such that an action can be taken at any level at which it wasexecuted in the real process—i.e., more than one action can be taken at each level. Aslong as the stochastic convergence conditions in equation 3 are still satisfied, the proofrequires no non-trivial modification. The Qn(x, a) values are still optimal for the modifiedARP, and this still tends to the real process in the original manner. Intuitively, the proofrelies on the ARP estimating rewards and transition functions based on many episodes,and this is just speeded up by changing more than one Q value per iteration.Although the paper has so far presented an apparent dichotomy between 9-learning andmethods based on certainty equivalence, such as Sato, Abe and Takeda (1988), in fact thereis more of a continuum. If the agent can remember the details of its learning episodes,then, after altering the learning rates, it can use each of them more than once (which isequivalent to putting cards that were thrown away, back in, lower down on the ARP stack).This biases the Q-learning process towards the particular sample of the rewards and transi-tions that it has experienced. In the limit of re-presenting 'old' cards infinitely often, thisreuse amounts to the certainty equivalence step of calculating the optimal actions for theobserved sample of the Markovian environment rather than the actual environment itself.The theorem above only proves the convergence of a restricted version of Watkins' (1989)comprehensive Q-learning algorithm, since it does not permit updates based on the rewardsfrom more than one iteration. This addition was pioneered by Sutton (1984; 1988) in hisTD(X) algorithm, in which a reward from a step taken r iterations previously is weightedby Xr, where X < 1. Unfortunately, the theorem does not extend trivially to this case, andalternative proof methods such as those in Kushner and Clark (1978) may be required.This paper has presented the proof outlined by Watkins (1989) that ^.-learning convergeswith probability one under reasonable conditions on the learning rates and the Markovianenvironment. Such a guarantee has previously eluded most methods of reinforcementlearning.AcknowledgmentsWe are very grateful to Andy Barto, Graeme Mitchison, Steve Nowlan, Satinder Singh,Rich Sutton and three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on multifariousaspects of Q-learning and this paper.

In general, the set of available actions may differ from state to state. Here we assume it does not, to simplifythe notation. The theorem we present can straightfowardly be extended to the general case.2. The discount factor for the ARP will be taken to be y, the same as for the real process.3. The bars over the £ indicate that the sum is over only a finite number of actions, with 0 terminal reward.AppendixThe action-replay processThe definition of the ARP is contingent on a particular sequence of episodes observedin the real process. The state space of the ARP is {(x, n)}, for x a state of the real processand n > 1, together with one, special, absorbing state, and the action space is {a} fora an action from the real process.The stochastic reward and state transition consequent on performing action a at state{x, n) is given as follows. For convenience, define ni = ni(x, a), as the index of the ithtime action a was tried at state x. Defineif x, a has been executed before episode notherwisesuch that ni* is the last time before episode n that x, a was exeucted in the real process.If i* = 0, the reward is set as Q0(x, a), and the ARP absorbs. Otherwise, letbe the index of the episode that is replayed or taken, chosen probabilistically from thecollection of existing samples from the real process. If ie = 0, then the reward is set atQo(x, a) and the ARP absorbs, as above, Otherwise, taking ie provides reward rnie, andcauses a state transition to (ynie, ne — 1) which is at level nie - 1. This last point iscrucial, taking an action in the ARP always causes a state transition to a lower level—soit ultimately terminates. The discount factor in the ARP is 7, the same as in the real process.63

From the construction of the ARP, Q0(X, a) is the optimal—indeed the onlypossible—action value of (x, 0), a. Therefore,Hence the theorem holds for n = 0.Suppose that the values of £n-1, as produced by the ^-learning rule, are the optimalaction values for the ARP at level n — 1, that isThis implies that the Vn-1(x) are the optimal values V* for the ARP at the n - 1th level,that isNow consider the cases in trying to perform action a in (x, n). If x, a = xn, an, then thisis the same as performing a in (x, n - 1), and £n(x, a) = Qn-1(x,a). Therefore,Otherwise, performing an in {xn, n}• with probability 1 - an is exactly the same as performing an in (xn, n - 1), or• with probability an yields immediate reward rn and new state (yn, n — 1).Therefore the optimal action value in the ARP of {xn, n}, an isfrom the induction hypothesis and the $n interation formula in equation 1.Hence, Q,n(x, a) = Q*ARP({x, n), a), Va, x, as required.64
