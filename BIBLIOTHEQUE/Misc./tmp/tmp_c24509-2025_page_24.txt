            The layout conditional generation result is presented in Fig. 12. First, we observe that the layout closely
            matches the semantic positions in the generated result. Additionally, as the layout changes, the positions
            of the vehicles in the scene also change accordingly, demonstrating that our model effectively captures the
            condition and influences both the overall scene layout and vehicle placement.
