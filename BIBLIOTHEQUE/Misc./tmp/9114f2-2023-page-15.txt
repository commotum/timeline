A MathMix

Similar to Lewkowycz et al. (2022) we construct a large-scale dataset of high-
quality math-relevant tokens for use in a lightweight pretraining stage, before
finetuning on comparably smaller datasets like MATH and PRM800K. This
dataset, which we call MathMix, has two main differences compared to the one
used to train Minerva. First, it is smaller and more aggressively filtered to high-
quality math problem-solving content, and second, it does not explicitly mix in
general language data.

Minerva was trained on 38.5B tokens of arXiv documents and webscrape
pages with LaTeX content, while MathMix consists of a smaller set of 1.5B
tokens containing individual math problems and their solutions, free-form text
discussing math problems and concepts, and synthetic data (Table 2). While
Minerva was pretrained on a dataset with 5% general natural language data,
we chose not to mix in any natural language data explicitly, primarily because
MathMix already contains plenty of natural language data.

Note that when training smaller models, as in Section 4, we use a slightly
smaller variant of MathMix that excludes the critiques data and only consists of
1B tokens. For our large models experiments, we train on MathMix for roughly
3B tokens (2 epochs). For our small models experiments, we train for 6 epochs
(roughly 6.6B tokens).

We apply a set of decontamination checks on MathMix against the test
split of the MATH dataset, including stripping out LaTeX and searching for
matching n-grams, but we can make no strong guarantees on the efficacy of this
decontamination. As discussed in Section 6.3, we would not expect the relative
comparisons made throughout this work to be significantly impacted by test set
contamination.
