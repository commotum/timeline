encode into the output representation (except for additions froma
few impasses). A second difficulty is that we haven't yet pursued
revealing test cases, such as ironic statements (discussed by Fo-
dor); it would be interesting to see whether (or when, or by what
preparatory encodings) irony is delivered as part of the comprehen-
sion process.

The upshot of this iteration through the criteria for modularity is
genuine ambiguity. Structurally, Soar is a nonmodular system for
janguage comprehension, because it uses exactly the same mecha-
nisms for comprehension as it does for general cognition. But the
system will behave in strongly modular ways. Or so it seems—the
story is hardly clear. However, the source of the ambiguity is not
far to seek. Soar is a cognitive system that continually specializes
itself on the basis of experience. This drives it to meet the fast-
operation constraint and also drives it to have many of the other
modularity properties for highly skilled activities.

One lesson in this for unified theories of cognition echoes the
secondary theme of Chapter 6—there are more possibilities in ar-
chitectures than might be imagined. The research on modularity
consists mostly of high-level arguments that attempt to establish
strong general properties of the class of architectures for the human
mind. This research works with a sketchy characterization of the
architecture for language processing and an almost null characteri-
zation of the architecture for general cognition. For the latter, it
telies mostly on the functional requirement that any knowledge
must be able to be brought to bear. This is essentially a knowledge-
level characterization. It does not have a sharp enough characteri-
zation to discover that classes of architectures for general cognition
can have the structure to appear modular under the appropriate
conditions. This appearance is not a unique property of Soar, of
course. It will tend to hold for systems that learn from experience in
the general manner of chunking.

8.2. Development

Let us move on to another point along the frontier—the develop-
ment of cognitive capabilities in children. It is not possible to talk
about the psychology of development in the second half of the
twentieth century without starting with Jean Piaget. It is he who has
structured the whole field, establishing conceptually the notion that
