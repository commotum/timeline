                             1]?Options:(A) (B) (C) (D)To solve this question, we need to identify which species from the options A,
                             B, C, and D is found in the blue area shown on the map, which corresponds to South America.-
                             Option (A) shows an Emu, which is native to Australia.- Option (B) shows an Ostrich, which is native
                             to Africa.- Option (C) shows a Cassowary, which is native to Australia and surrounding areas.-
                             Option (D) shows a Rhea, which is native to South America. The blue area on the map marks South
                             America. Therefore, the species found there is represented by option (D), the Rhea. Answer: D
                             Analysis: The Standard Setting correctly identified (B) Rhea as the species native to the blue region
                             (South America), while Vision Input mistakenly selected (D) Ostrich, which is native to Africa, not
                             SouthAmerica.
