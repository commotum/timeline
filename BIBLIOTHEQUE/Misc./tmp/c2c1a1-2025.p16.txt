                                             Besides, we adopt the APPNP smoothing [40] as an output query array
                                       as shown in Eq. 2.
                                                                        X(0) = X,
                                                                            (l)                        e−1 ee−1 (l−1)                           (0)
                                                                        X          = (1−α)D 2AD 2X                                   +αX ,
                                                                 b                           (L)
                                                                XAPPNP = X                                                                                               (2)
                                       APPNPadoptspersonalized propagation, and it provides more data specific
                                       smoothing methods. We empirically find that the output query array with
                                       a smoothing method is one of the key factors for the GPIO. Section 4.5.

                                       4.3. Input Array
                                             The GPIO requires the flexible input structure as the Perceiver or Per-
                                       ceiver IO. For image and text dataset, jaegle et al. propose Fourier embedding
                                       to consider the spatial or sequential information, but it shows poor perfor-

                                       To reflect the topological information, specifically canonical positional in-

                                       random walk positional embedding (RWPE) [41]. Random walk operators
                                       are defined as R = AD−1 where A ∈ RM×M is the adjacency matrix, and D
                                       is the degree matrix. RWPE of node i is defined as

                                                                                            i         ii      ii          ii

                                       returning to the i node. dwivedi et al. adopt RWPE as positional encoding
