H Synthetic Supervision Details

We can use PRMiarge to provide either outcome or process supervision for
smaller models. We determine the labels for individual steps based on the
step-level probabilities outputted by PRMjarge- To do this, we set an arbitrary
threshold: any step that PRMharge assigns a negative label with greater than
20% probability is considered incorrect. We choose this threshold based on the
observation that PRMjarge is slightly miscalibrated in the direction of favoring
positive labels.

To provide process supervision for a solution, we directly return the step-
level labels (positive or negative) provided by PRMjarge, up until the first step
that is marked as negative. This mimics our true human data collection process.
To provide outcome supervision, we mark the solution as correct if and only if
PRMharge considers every step to be correct (using the same thresholding logic).
