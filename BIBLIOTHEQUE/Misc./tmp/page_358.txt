346 # Unified Theories of Cognition

1. Power law of practice and its ubiquity
* Absolute rates of acquisitions
* Limits and exceptions
2. Transfer effects
* Skill Jearning is generally highly specific
3. Regimes that affect learning rate and transfer
* Spaced vs. massed practice
+ Immediate feedback and knowledge of results

which plays an interesting role in Soar as a unified theory of cogni-
tion. In discussing the data-chunking problem we reviewed the his-
tory of our research on chunking, how we developed the chunking
theory of the practice law, and then we developed two different
production-system architectures (Xaps2 and Xaps3) that exhibited
the power law. However, when we developed Soar chunking out of
these ideas, we left behind the three-production chunk and the
parallel hierarchical structures of encoding and decoding. The lat-
ter, in particular, seemed strongly involved in obtaining the power
law. Thus, an important question is whether Soar still provides an
explanation of the power law of practice.

As Figure 6-17 demonstrates, Soar does indeed still exhibit the
law. This task is the same 1,023-choice reaction task (Seibel, 1963)
illustrated in Figure 1-3: the subject places ten fingers opposite ten
lights, a pattern of lights is displayed, and the subject strikes the
corresponding chord. Soar can be set to do that task by giving it an
appropriate set of problem spaces and operators. The only impor-
tant feature, besides chunking, is that it encodes regions of the
stimulus and response as intervals and not just as individual lights
and buttons. The version of Soar whose performance is plotted in
Figure 6-17 split the fields in half, but an exact split does not make
any difference. The figure shows the data for 125 trials of the Seibel
task; the log of the number of decision cycles is plotted against the
log of the number of trials. The decreasing straight line means that
Soar skill acquisition follows the power law, in at least this one

instance.

The bottom graph shows the behavior of a single person for 280

trials at the beginning, which corresponds to the Soar curve. What
is immediately noticeable is that the slope of the human curve is
very shallow (—.17) compared with Soar’s (—.80). In general, the
