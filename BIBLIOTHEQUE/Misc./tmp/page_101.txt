MST to LSI to VLSI.'* This last, VLSI, has introduced many new
notions, such as area constraints and geometrical layout. Never-
theless, the register-transfer level has not changed an iota. There
has been no evolution at all in terms of the level structure in com-
puting systems,

We do not understand the force of this invariance. It may in fact
be related to the engineering technologies we build or to the conser-
vatism that now inhabits the computer field, with its concern for
upward compatibility enforced by economics. Clearly, radically dif-
ferent technologies, such as biological ones, should change the
hierarchy somewhat. One of the major challenges in the develop-
ment of massively parallel connectionist systems is whether they
will find a different hierarchical organization. In any event, the
computer-systems hierarchy is an important invariant structural
characteristic, although its seems to be the only one.

2,7. Intelligence

intelligence is another central concept of cognitive science. Like
the other concepts we have discussed, it has a long history unre-
lated to the attempts to shape it to the particular needs of cognitive
science. Unfortunately, the history of the concept of intelligence is
filled with contention, and ina way that the other concepts are not.
The contention has spilled out into the larger political and social
