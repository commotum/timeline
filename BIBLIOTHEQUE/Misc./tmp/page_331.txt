this sense, Soar retains the flavor of identical elements. Most im-
portant, elements can be actually counted, the amount of transfer
measured, and the quantitative predictions of learning times
verified (Polson & Kieras, 1985; Polson, Muncher, & Engelbeck,
1986; Singley & Anderson, 1989}.

Transfer by identical elements implies that learning will tend to
be highly specific. That can be seen in the way chunks are built up
from the specific case. Thus, in general, there is little transfer to
different situations. This agrees with the central conclusions of the
stream of educational research that Thorndike initiated (Singley &
Anderson, 1989, chap. 1). However, it need not always be the
case—transfer occurs if the original productions (the identical ele-
ments) apply in the new situation. Transfer can be highly general if
the productions are appropriately abstract. As Soar shows, this
happens only if the representation is just right. For instance, when
Soar solved a constraint-satisfaction problem, the chunks captured
the general program for solving that constraint on later occasions.
But the norm is for chunks to be specific, because they have incor-
porated specific features of the local task environment in their con-
ditions.

Psychology often casts the issue of transfer in terms of generali-
zation gradients and similarity metrics to explain how transfer and
generalization occur (Osgood, 1949). These metrics are seen as part
of the structure of the task environment. Soar says that such met-
Tics can be found. The conditions of chunks, which determine
whether transfer occurs, test the structure of the environment—
two environments must be alike in some specific way if the chunk is
to transfer. Metrics will always be approximate, however, because
they are based on functional grounds. Variation can occur on every
hew use, because what features are attended to depends on the
details of the task to be solved. Hence, similarity metrics are never
going to be highly reliable, because they are grounded in the shifting
sands of function.?

(4) The theory suggests that when people read sentences, they
learn the gist of the sentence but not the verbatim sentence (Bar-
clay, Bransford & Franks, 1972; Fillenbaum, 1966). In terms of

3, This conclusion applies to cognitive skills; the issue of perceptual or motor gra-
dients need not be the same (Shepard, 1987). For Soar the nature of similarity metrics
depends on what role chunking plays in perception and motor behavior (£ and D of the
total cognitive system).
