task. Furthermore, in general this search is not a one-time retrieval
that initializes a small body of knowledge relevant to the task. Some
tasks have such a character, but generally at every state in the
problem space there is the possibility that some new knowledge,
available in the mind but not hitherto retrieved, has become rele-
vant. Thus, the knowledge search goes on continually—and the
more problematical the situation, the more continuous is the need
for it. Knowledge search occurs in the inner loop of problem
search. Knowledge is used to select the Operators for the problem
search and to evaluate their consequences; hence knowledge is
called upon within each state.

Knowledge search and problem search differ radically in their
