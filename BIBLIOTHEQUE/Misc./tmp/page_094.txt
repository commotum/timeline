Figure 2-12. Fixed structure means changing relatively slowly.

Tegister-transfer level is the architecture. More precisely, what is
fixed mechanism (hardware) and what is content (software) at the
symbol level is described by the description of the system at the
register-transfer level. Of course, system hierarchies may exist that
are different from the familiar one developed for computers, and
then the architecture would be defined accordingly. To state the
matter in general: given a symbol system, the architecture is the

. description of the system in whatever system-description scheme

exists next below the symbol level,

It is customary to say, as above, that the architecture is the fixed
structure and to talk about the architecture as genuinely immutable.
For standard digital computers this is mostly true, and where it is
not, as in systems that have levels of microcode, the changes are

_ Viewed as deliberate. Computer science has built up the notions of

' virtual machine, firmware, and dynamic configurability as appropri-

ate ways to describe such structures. With natural systems (human
cognition), a more general view is required, namely, that what
counts is the relative rate of change. Figure 2-12 illustrates the
situation. To tap into the reader's intuitions, it uses a human time

; scale, where task performance is taken to occur in the order of a
second (1 sec), What is important is the relative time scale, not the

absolute numbers.

The primitive atomic actions of the system take about a hun-
dredth of a second (0.01 sec). To accomplish even a modestly com-
plex task requires some data to be stored as intermediate temporary
values. This occurs at a rate of about a tenth of a second (0.1 sec).
Some number of these is required to produce task performance at
about a second (1 sec). The architecture is the structure that is fixed
while the system produces that performance. Clearly, not all struc-
ture is fixed over the course of a performance. Some structure holds
the inputs and outputs for each primitive action, which operate
