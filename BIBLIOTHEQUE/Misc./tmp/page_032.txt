Unified Theories of Cognition = 19

. Behave flexibly as a function of the environment
. Exhibit adaptive (rational, goal-oriented) behavior
. Operate in real time

. Operate in a rich, complex, detailed environment
+ Perceive an immense amount of changing detail
> Use vast amounts of knowledge
* Control a motor system of many degrees of freedom

. Use symbols and abstractions

. Use language, both natural and artificial

. Learn from the enviranment and from experience

. Acquire capabilities through development

9. Operate autonomously, but within a social community
10. Be self-aware and have a sense of self

11. Be realizable as a neural system

12. Be constructable by an embryologicai growth process
13. Arise through evolution

know so many relevant things—and opportunity implies obligation
in an evolutionary, hence competitive, world. The motor system to
get around in a complex world requires many degrees of freedom,
which are actually degrees of freedom per second, because the
environment keeps changing. Actually, the number of degrees of
freedom for humans is only moderately large—hundreds of degrees
of freedom. It is not very large—thousands or tens of thousands of
degrees of freedom. It is not clear why the number is so small.
(5) Mind is able to use symbols and abstractions. We know that
just from observing ourselves, (6) It is also able to use language,
both natural and artificial. These two constraints, symbols and lan-
guage, might amount to the same thing or they might impose some-
what distinct requirements. Opinions vary with scientific persua-
sion; which way it turns out is not important for this list as tong as
there is coverage. Indeed, either or both of these could be effec-
tively equivalent to the constraint of flexibility or vice versa. They

all have to be there.
(7) We must be able to learn from the environment, not occasion-

ally but continuously, and not about a few specifics but everything
and every way under the sun. (8) We must acquire capabilities
through development. When the neonate first arrives it is surely
