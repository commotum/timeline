going extensive development, but this is because the field is still
searching for learning schemes with the right properties.

Third, connectionism sees neural networks as being the natural
way to provide certain kinds of powers that are deemed to be signif:
icant for human cognition. There are several such powers and not
every connectionist assigns the same significance to each one, since
connectionism is a large enough social movement now to have sub-
groups with divergent opinions. Furthermore, there is no need for
agreement on the nature of these significant powers, because it is
possible to adopt a bottom-up stance that connectionist neural net-
works accomplish brainlike computations, hence automatically will
provide whatever powers cognition exhibits. There is, neverthe-
less, a strong functionalist urge in connectionism, just as there is
throughout AI. Humans exhibit incredibly flexible intellectual
power, which must be achieved by computational organizations of
some sort. Showing that the right sorts of power and flexibility are
provided by a given computational technology (here, connectionist
neural networks) is a major way to discover the nature of the brain
and mind.

Perhaps the cognitive power most universally held to be provided
by connectionist networks is the ability to become organized in
task-relevant ways just by performing tasks, without requiring pro-
gramming by an intelligent agent. Connectionist neural networks
exhibit this through their continuous learning by adjustment of
weights. Another cognitive power that seems significant is finding
the solution to very large systems of weak or soft constraints. Thus,
the multitude of influences that impinge on cognitive behavior all
seem to be brought to bear at each instant of behavior. Connection-
ist neural networks exhibit this because activation simultaneously
flows throughout the network until equilibrium is reached, with the
final, stable state reflecting the entire network. Yet a third cognitive
power is the ability for all processes to be graded rather than dis-
crete. Connectionist neural networks exhibit this naturally because
their medium of activation is continuous and quantitative. The
significance of this last power is felt very strongly to be of the
essence of human cognition. The reverse side of this is a deep doubt
and suspicion of discrete, symbolic structures as a medium for
human experience—amounting almost to a visceral aversion, it
sometimes seems.

So how does Soar stand with respect to these three aspects? As
