                Figure 3.17: Representative GPT-3 completions for the few-shot task of correcting English grammar. Boldface
                is GPT-3’s completions, plain text is human prompts. In the ﬁrst few examples example both the prompt and the
                completion are provided by a human; this then serves as conditioning for subsequent examples where GPT-3 receives
                successive additional prompts and provides the completions. Nothing task-speciﬁc is provided to GPT-3 aside from
                the ﬁrst few examples as conditioning and the “Poor English input/Good English output” framing. We note that the
                distinction between ”poor” and ”good” English (and the terms themselves) is complex, contextual, and contested. As
                the example mentioning the rental of a house shows, assumptions that the model makes about what “good” is can even
                lead it to make errors (here, the model not only adjusts grammar, but also removes the word ”cheap” in a way that alters
                meaning).
