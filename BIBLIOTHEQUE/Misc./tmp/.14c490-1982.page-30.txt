Figure 18.18 Drawings of the lateral and medial views of the left hemisphere and of a cross-section through
the superior temporal sulcus to illustrate the topographic arrangement of striate projections to this second-
ary visual area. The orderly mapping within the sulcus of the entire representation of the contralateral visual
field is shown. For abbreviations see figure 18.3. Source: Ungerleider and Mishkin 1979b.

sions, where there was almost total destruction of the prestriate areas
that receive direct projections from lateral striate cortex (the part repre-
senting central vision), there was no more than 50% destruction (Un-
gerleider et al., in prep.) of the prestriate areas that receive direct pro-
jections from posterior and medial striate cortex (the parts representing
peripheral and far peripheral vision). Clearly, it was the sparing of this
tissue that accounted for the continued (though reduced) transmission
of visual information to inferior temporal cortex that had been demon-
strated not only behaviorally but also electrophysiologically. Thus, the
present anatomical findings, many of which have now been confirmed
by others (Weller and Kaas 1978; Maunsell et al. 1979; Rockland 1979;
Van Essen et al. 1979; Weller et al. 1979), provide a coherent explanation
for a large body of seemingly paradoxical results regarding the effects of
prestriate lesions. That is, just as “peripheral” striate cortex can mediate
pattern discrimination in the absence of “central” striate cortex (Blake et
