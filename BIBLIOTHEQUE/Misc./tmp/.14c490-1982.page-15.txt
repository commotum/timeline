Figure 18.6 Comparison of two crossed-lesion disconnection experiments: (A) pattern discrimination after
striate-temporal disconnection (Mishkin 1966) and (B) landmark discrimination after striate-parietal discon-
nection (Ungerleider and Mishkin 1978a). In each case, brain diagrams illustrate the three lesions (in black)
involved in the disconnection and bar graphs show the mean trials to relearn after each lesion. F indicates
failure to relearn within the limits of training.

Figure 18.7 Locus of two different bilateral striate-cortex removals (in black): (A) lateral striate, the area
representing central vision (N = 5); (B) medial striate, the area representing peripheral vision (N = 5). For
details of visuotopic organization see figure 18.13; for abbreviations see figure 18.3.
