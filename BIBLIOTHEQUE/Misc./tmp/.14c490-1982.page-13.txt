Figure 18.5 Design and results of the striate-parietal crossed-lesion disconnection study. (A) Landmark
task. Monkeys were rewarded for choosing the covered foodwell located closer to a striped cylinder (the
“Jandmark”), which was positioned on the left or the right randomly from trial to trial, but always 5 cm from
one foodwell and 20 cm from the other. Training was given for 30 trials per day to a criterion of 90 correct
responses in 100 consecutive trials. (B) Discrimination retention before and after first-stage lesion (unilateral
posterior parietal; N = 3); 10 preoperative trials and 130 postoperative trials. (C) Discrimination retention
before and after second-stage lesion (contralateral striate; N = 3); 70 preoperative and 880 postoperative
trials. (D) Discrimination retention before and after third-stage lesion (corpus callosum; N = 3); 30 preoper-
ative and 400 postoperative trials. At each stage the lesion is shown in black and the lesions of prior stages
are shaded. Arrows denote hypothetical connections left intact by lesions. Adapted from Ungerleider and
Miskin 1978a.
