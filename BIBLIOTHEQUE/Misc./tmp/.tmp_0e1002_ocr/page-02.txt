The right side of (7) vanishes only on the surface of
an ellipsoid F, and is positive only in the interior of F.
The surfaces of constant Q are concentric spheres. If S
denotes a particular one of these spheres whose interior
R contains the ellipsoid Z, it is evident that each tra-
jectory eventually becomes trapped within R.

3. The instability of nonperiodic flow

In this section we shall establish one of the most
important properties of deterministic nonperiodic flow,
namely, its instability with respect to modifications of
small amplitude. We shall find it convenient to do this
by identifying the solutions of the governing equations
with trajectories in phase space. We shall use such
symbols as P(é) (variable argument) to denote trajec-
tories, and such symbols as P or P(fo) (no argument or
constant argument) to denote points, the latter symbol
denoting the specific point through which P(é) passes
at time fo.

We shall deal with a phase space F in which a unique
trajectory passes through each point, and where the
passage of time defines a continuous deformation of any
region of I’ into another region, so that if the points
P(t), Pato), -- -approach Po(f) as a limit, the points
Pillotr), Poltot+7), «++must approach Po(éo+7) as a
limit. We shall furthermore require that the trajectories
be uniformly bounded as :—> ~ ; that is, there must be
a bounded region R, such that every trajectory ulti-
mately remains with R. Our procedure is influenced by
the work of Birkhoff (1927) on dynamical systems, but
differs in that Birkhoff was concerned mainly with con-
servative systems. A rather detailed treatment of dy-
namical systems has been given by Nemytskii and
Stepanov (1960), and rigorous proofs of some of the
theorems which we shall present are to be found in
that source.

We shall first classify the trajectories in three different
manners, namely, according to the absence or presence
of transient properties, according to the stability or
‘instability of the trajectories with respect to small
modifications, and according to the presence or absence
of periodic behavior.

Since any trajectory P(é) is bounded, it must possess
at least one limit point Po, a point which it approaches
arbitrarily closely arbitrarily often, More precisely, Po is
a limit point of P(¢) if for any «> 0 and any time ¢, there
exists a time é:(e,4)}>4 such that | P(t2)—Pol <e. Here

absolute-value signs denote distance in phase space.
Because IT is continuously deformed as # varies, every
point on the trajectory through Po is also a limit point
of P(t}, and the set of limit points of P(é) forms a tra-
jectory, or a set of trajectories, called the limiting tra-
jectories of P(t). A limiting trajectory is obviously con-
tained within R in its entirety.

If a trajectory is contained among its own limiting
trajectories, it will be called central; otherwise it will be
called xoncentral. A central trajectory passes arbitrarily
closely arbitrarily often to any point through which it
has previously passed, and, in this sense at least, sepa-
rate sufficiently long segments of a central trajectory
are statistically similar. A noncentral trajectory remains
a certain distance away from any point through which
it has previously passed. It must approach its entire set
of limit points asymptotically, although it need not
approach any particular limiting trajectory asymptoti-
cally, Its instantaneous distance from its closest limit
point is therefore a transient quantity, which becomes
arbitrarily small as !—> ©.

A trajectory P(t) will be called stable at a point P(t)
if any other trajectory passing sufficicntly close to P(é)
at time 4 remains close to P(!) as t1-> ©; Le, P(#) is
stable at P(t) if for any «>O there exists a d(e,t1)>0
such that if |Pu)—P(ip| <8 and &>4, | Pitts)
—P(t2)|<e. Otherwise P(Z) will be called unstable at
P(h). Because T is continuously deformed as é varies,
a trajectory which is stable at one point is stable at every
point, and will be called a stable trajectory. A trajectory
unstable at one point is unstable at every point, and
will be called an wzstable trajectory. In the special case
that P(t) is confined to one point, this definition of
stability coincides with the familiar concept of stability
of steady flow.

Astable trajectory P(é) will be called uniformly stable
if the distance within which a neighboring trajectory
must approach a point P(4), in order to be certain of
remaining close to P(f) as i ©, itself possesses a
positive lower bound as fi ©; i.e., P(?) is uniformly
stable if for any e>0 there cxists a 6(e)>0 and a time
fn(e) such that if h>t and [Pil4)~P(A)| <6 and
&y>h, |Piltz)—P(t)|<e. A limiting trajectory Pa(t) of
a umformly stable trajectory P(é) must be uniformly
stable itself, since all trajectorics passing sufficiently
close to Pu{é) must pass arbitrarily close to some point
of P(t) and so must remain close to P(t}, and hence to
Pb), as t—>

Since each point lies on a unique trajectory, any
trajectory passing through a point through which it has
previously passed must continue to repeat its past be-
havior, and so must be periodic. A trajectory P(Z) will
be called quasi-periodic if for some arbitrarily large
time interval +, P(+7) ultimately remains arbitrarily
close to P(#), ie., P() is quasi-periodic if for any «>0
and for any time interval 7o, there exists a 7(€,79)>70
and a time ¢1(e,79) such that if f2> 41, | P(ée4+-7)—P(te) |
