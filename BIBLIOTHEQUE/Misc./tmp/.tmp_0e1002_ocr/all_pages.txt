ABSTRACT

Finite systems of deterministic ordinary nonlinear differential equations may be designed to represent
forced dissipative hydrodynamic flow. Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in.
phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily
unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into consider-
ably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions.

A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found
to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic.

The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.

1. Introduction

Certain hydrodynamical systems exhibit steady-state
flow patterns, while others oscillate in a regular periodic
fashion. Still others vary in an irregular, seemingly
haphazard manner, and, even when observed for long
periods of time, do not appear to repeat their previous
history.

These modes of behavior may all be observed in the
familiar rotating-basin experiments, described by Fultz,
et al. (1959) and Hide (1958). In these experiments, a
cylindrical vessel containing water is rotated about its
axis, and is heated near its rim and cooled near its center
in a steady symmetrical fashion. Under certain condi-
tions the resulting flow is as symmetric and steady as the
heating which gives rise to it. Under different conditions
a system of regularly spaced waves develops, and pro-
gresses at a uniform speed without changing its shape.
Under still different conditions an irregular flow pattern
forms, and moves and changes its shape in an irregular
nonperiodic manner.

Lack of periodicity is very common in natural sys-
tems, and is one of the distinguishing features of turbu-
lent flow. Because instantaneous turbulent flow patterns
are so irregular, attention is often confined to the sta-
tistics of turbulence, which, in contrast to the details of
turbulence, often behave in a regular well-organized
manner. The short-range weather forecaster, however,
is forced willy-nilly to predict the details of the large-
scale turbulent eddies—the cyclones and anticyclones—
which continually arrange themselves into new patterns.

1 The research reported in this work has been sponsored by the
Geophysics Research Directorate of the Air Force Cambridge
Research Center, under Contract No, AF 19(604)-4969.

Thus there are occasions when more than the statistics
of irregular flow are of very real concern.

In this study we shall work with systems of deter-
ministic equations which are idealizations of hydro-
dynamical systems. We shall be interested principally in
nonperiodic solutions, ie., solutions which never repeat
their past history exactly, and where all approximate
repetitions are of finite duration. Thus we shall be in-
volved with the ultimate behavior of the solutions, as
opposed to the transient behavior associated with
arbitrary initial conditions.

A closed hydrodynamical system of finite mass may
ostensibly be treated mathematically as a finite collec-
tion of molecules—usually a very large finite collection
—in which case the governing laws are expressible as a
finite set of ordinary differential equations. These equa-
tions are generally highly intractable, and the set of
molecules is usually approximated by a continuous dis-
tribution of mass. The governing laws are then expressed
as a set of partial differential equations, containing such
quantities as velocity, density, and pressure as de-
pendent variables.

It is sometimes possible to obtain particular solutions
of these equations analytically, especially when the
solutions are periodic or invariant with time, and, in-
deed, much work has been devoted te obtaining such
solutions by one scheme or another. Ordinarily, how-
ever, nonperiodic solutions cannot readily be deter-
mined except by numerical procedures. Such procedures
involve replacing the continuous variables by a new
finite set of functions of time, which may perhaps be the
values of the continuous variables at a chosen grid of
points, or the coefficients in the expansions of these
variables in series of orthogonal functions. The govern-
ing laws then become a finite set of ordinary differential

equations again, although a far simpler set than the one
which governs individual molecular motions.

In any real hydrodynamical system, viscous dissipa-
tion is always occurring, unless the system is moving as
a solid, and thermal dissipation is always occurring,
unless the system is at constant temperature. Vor cer-
tain purposes many systems may be treated as conserva-
tive systems, in which the total energy, or some other
quantity, does not vary with time. In seeking the ulti-
mate behavior of a system, the use of conservative
equations is unsatisfactory, since the ultimate value of
any conservative quantity would then have to equal the
arbitrarily chosen initial value. This difficulty may be
obviated by including the dissipative processes, thereby
making the equations nonconservative, and also includ-
ing external mechanical or thermal forcing, thus pre-
venting the system from ultimately reaching a state of
rest. If the system is to be deterministic, the forcing
functions, if not constant with time, must themselves
vary according to some deterministic rule.

In this work, then, we shall deal specifically with
finite systems of deterministic ordinary differential
equations, designed to represent forced dissipative
hydrodynamical systems. We shall study the properties
of nonperiodic solutions of these equations.

It is not obvious that such solutions can exist at all.
Indeed, in dissipative systems governed by finite sets of
linear equations, a constant forcing leads ultimately to
a constant response, while a periodic forcing leads to a
petiodic response, Hence, nonperiodic flow has some-
times been regarded as the result of nonperiodic or
random forcing.

The reasoning leading to these concludions is not
applicable when the governing equations are nonlinear.
If the equations contain terms representing advection—
the transport of some property of a fluid by the motion
of the fluid itself—a constant forcing can lead to a
variable response. In the rotating-basin experiments
already mentioned, both periodic and nonperiodic flow
result from thermal forcing which, within the limits of
experimental control, is constant. Exact periodic solu-
tions of simplified systems of equations, representing
dissipative flow with constant thermal forcing, have
been obtained analytically by the writer (1962a). The
writer (1962b) has also found nonperiodic solutions of
similar systems of cquations by numerical means.

2. Phase space

Consider a system whose state may be described by If
variables X1, +--, Xac. Let the system be governed by
the set of equations

dX,fdt=FAX1:--Xap, t=1,-°-,M, (1)
where time é is the single independent variable, and the
functions F; possess continuous first partial derivatives.
Such a system may be studied by means of phase space—

EDWARD N.

LORENZ 131
an M-dimensional Euclidean space T whose coordinates
are Xq, ---, Xay. Each point in phase space represents a
possible instantaneous state of the system. A state
which is varying in accordance with (1) is represented
by a moving particle in phase space, traveling along a
irajectory in phase space. For completeness, the position
of a stationary particle, representing a steady state, is
included as a trajectory.

Phase space has been a useful concept in treating
finite systems, and has been used by such mathema-
ticians as Gibbs (1902) in his development of statistical
mechanics, Poincaré (1881) in his treatment of the solu-
tions of differential equations, and Birkhoff (1927) in
his treatise on dynamical systems,

From the theory of differential equations (e,g., Ford
1933, ch. 6), it follows, since the partial derivatives
oF,/aX, are continuous, that if fo is any time, and if
X10, -*-X yo is any point in T, equations (1) possess a
unique solution

X= fi{X1y+++ Xaof), t=1, +--+, M, (2)

valid throughout some time interval containing fo, and
satisfying the condition

FlXr0,°+ Xatuto) =X, tel, +, Me. (3)
The functions f, are continuous in X10, +--, Xaro and
Hence there is a unique trajectory through each point of
T. Two or more trajectories may, however, approach the
same point or the same curve asymptotically as {—> 2
or as i» —«, Moreover, since the functions f; are
continuous, the passage of time defines a continuous
deformation of any region of I' into another region.

In the familiar case of a conservative system, where
some positive definite quantity Q, which may represent
some form of energy, is invariant with time, each tra-
jectory is confined to one or another of the surfaces of
constant Q. These surfaces may take the form of closed
concentric shells.

Tf, on the other hand, there is dissipation and forcing,
and if, whenever Q equals or exceeds some fixed value
Oy, the dissipation acts to diminish Q more rapidly then
the forcing can increase (), then (—dQ/d!) has a positive
lower bound where Q2(Q,, and each trajectory must
ultimately become trapped in the region where Q<Q1.
Trajectories representing forced dissipative flow may
therefore differ considerably from those representing
conservative flow.

Forced dissipative systems of this sort are typified
by the system

The right side of (7) vanishes only on the surface of
an ellipsoid F, and is positive only in the interior of F.
The surfaces of constant Q are concentric spheres. If S
denotes a particular one of these spheres whose interior
R contains the ellipsoid Z, it is evident that each tra-
jectory eventually becomes trapped within R.

3. The instability of nonperiodic flow

In this section we shall establish one of the most
important properties of deterministic nonperiodic flow,
namely, its instability with respect to modifications of
small amplitude. We shall find it convenient to do this
by identifying the solutions of the governing equations
with trajectories in phase space. We shall use such
symbols as P(é) (variable argument) to denote trajec-
tories, and such symbols as P or P(fo) (no argument or
constant argument) to denote points, the latter symbol
denoting the specific point through which P(é) passes
at time fo.

We shall deal with a phase space F in which a unique
trajectory passes through each point, and where the
passage of time defines a continuous deformation of any
region of I’ into another region, so that if the points
P(t), Pato), -- -approach Po(f) as a limit, the points
Pillotr), Poltot+7), «++must approach Po(éo+7) as a
limit. We shall furthermore require that the trajectories
be uniformly bounded as :—> ~ ; that is, there must be
a bounded region R, such that every trajectory ulti-
mately remains with R. Our procedure is influenced by
the work of Birkhoff (1927) on dynamical systems, but
differs in that Birkhoff was concerned mainly with con-
servative systems. A rather detailed treatment of dy-
namical systems has been given by Nemytskii and
Stepanov (1960), and rigorous proofs of some of the
theorems which we shall present are to be found in
that source.

We shall first classify the trajectories in three different
manners, namely, according to the absence or presence
of transient properties, according to the stability or
‘instability of the trajectories with respect to small
modifications, and according to the presence or absence
of periodic behavior.

Since any trajectory P(é) is bounded, it must possess
at least one limit point Po, a point which it approaches
arbitrarily closely arbitrarily often, More precisely, Po is
a limit point of P(¢) if for any «> 0 and any time ¢, there
exists a time é:(e,4)}>4 such that | P(t2)—Pol <e. Here

absolute-value signs denote distance in phase space.
Because IT is continuously deformed as # varies, every
point on the trajectory through Po is also a limit point
of P(t}, and the set of limit points of P(é) forms a tra-
jectory, or a set of trajectories, called the limiting tra-
jectories of P(t). A limiting trajectory is obviously con-
tained within R in its entirety.

If a trajectory is contained among its own limiting
trajectories, it will be called central; otherwise it will be
called xoncentral. A central trajectory passes arbitrarily
closely arbitrarily often to any point through which it
has previously passed, and, in this sense at least, sepa-
rate sufficiently long segments of a central trajectory
are statistically similar. A noncentral trajectory remains
a certain distance away from any point through which
it has previously passed. It must approach its entire set
of limit points asymptotically, although it need not
approach any particular limiting trajectory asymptoti-
cally, Its instantaneous distance from its closest limit
point is therefore a transient quantity, which becomes
arbitrarily small as !—> ©.

A trajectory P(t) will be called stable at a point P(t)
if any other trajectory passing sufficicntly close to P(é)
at time 4 remains close to P(!) as t1-> ©; Le, P(#) is
stable at P(t) if for any «>O there exists a d(e,t1)>0
such that if |Pu)—P(ip| <8 and &>4, | Pitts)
—P(t2)|<e. Otherwise P(Z) will be called unstable at
P(h). Because T is continuously deformed as é varies,
a trajectory which is stable at one point is stable at every
point, and will be called a stable trajectory. A trajectory
unstable at one point is unstable at every point, and
will be called an wzstable trajectory. In the special case
that P(t) is confined to one point, this definition of
stability coincides with the familiar concept of stability
of steady flow.

Astable trajectory P(é) will be called uniformly stable
if the distance within which a neighboring trajectory
must approach a point P(4), in order to be certain of
remaining close to P(f) as i ©, itself possesses a
positive lower bound as fi ©; i.e., P(?) is uniformly
stable if for any e>0 there cxists a 6(e)>0 and a time
fn(e) such that if h>t and [Pil4)~P(A)| <6 and
&y>h, |Piltz)—P(t)|<e. A limiting trajectory Pa(t) of
a umformly stable trajectory P(é) must be uniformly
stable itself, since all trajectorics passing sufficiently
close to Pu{é) must pass arbitrarily close to some point
of P(t) and so must remain close to P(t}, and hence to
Pb), as t—>

Since each point lies on a unique trajectory, any
trajectory passing through a point through which it has
previously passed must continue to repeat its past be-
havior, and so must be periodic. A trajectory P(Z) will
be called quasi-periodic if for some arbitrarily large
time interval +, P(+7) ultimately remains arbitrarily
close to P(#), ie., P() is quasi-periodic if for any «>0
and for any time interval 7o, there exists a 7(€,79)>70
and a time ¢1(e,79) such that if f2> 41, | P(ée4+-7)—P(te) |

A convenient scheme for automatic computation is the
successive evaluation of Xanan, Xiceng2y), aNd Xengr
according to (9), (10) and (14). We have used this
procedure in all the computations described in this
study.

In phase space a numerical solution of (1) must be
represented by a jumping particle rather than a con-
tinuously moving particle. Moreover, if a digital com-
puter is instructed to represent each number in its
memory by a preassigned fixed number of bits, only
certain discrete points in phase space will ever be oc-
cupied. If the numerical solution is bounded, repetitions
must eventually occur, so that, strictly speaking, every
numerical solution is periodic. In practice this considera-
tion may be disregarded, if the number of different
possible states is far greater than the number of itera-
tions ever likely to be performed. The necessity for
repetition could be avoided altogether by the somewhat
uneconomical procedure of letting the precision of
computation increase as ” increases.

Consider now numerical solutions of equations (4),
obtained by the forward-difference procedure (11). For
such solutions,

Quis Ont (€0/d)nAt+3 L FFP a)AP. (15)

Let S’ be any surface of constant Q whose interior R’
contains the ellipsoid Z where dQ/di vanishes, and let
S be any surface of constant @ whose interior R con-
tains S’.

Since D F? and dQ/dé both possess upper bounds in
R’, we may choose Af so small that Pn41 lies in R if
P, lies in R’. Likewise, since 3° F? possesses an upper
bound and dQ/di possesses a negative upper bound in
R-~R’, we may choose At so small that Qnyia<@n if Pu
lies in R—R’. Hence At may be chosen so small that any
jumping particle which has entered R remains trapped
within R, and the numerical solution does not blow up.
A blow-up may still occur, however, if initially the
particle is exterior to R.

Consider now the double-approximation procedure
(14). The previous arguments imply not only that
Paty lies within R if P, lies within R, but also that
P qat2y) lies within R if Penyi) lies within R. Since the
region & is convex, it follows that P,.+1, as given by (14),
lies within R if P,, lies within R. Hence if Af is chosen so
small that the forward-difference procedure does not
blow up, the double-approximation procedure also does
not blow up.

We note in passing that if we apply the forward-
difference procedure to a conservative system where
dQ/di=0 everywhere,

totically approaching a steady state. A similar result
holds when the double-approximation procedure (14) is
applied to a conservative system.

5. The convection equations of Saltzman

In this section we ‘shall introduce a system of three
ordinary differential equations whose solutions afford
the simplest example of deterministic nonperiodic flow
of which the writer is aware. The system is a simplifica-
tion of one derived by Saltzman (1962) to study finite-
amplitude convection. Although our present interest. is
in the nonperiodic nature of its solutions, rather than
in its contributions to the convection problem, we shall
describe its physical background brietly.

Rayleigh (1916) studied the flow occurring in a layer
of fluid of uniform depth H, when the temperature
difference between the upper and lower surfaces is
maintained at a constant value AT. Such a system
possesses a steady-state solution in which there is no
motion, and the temperature varies linearly with depth,
If this solution is unstable, convection should develop.

In the case where all motions are parallel to the
x~—~z-plane, and no variations in the direction of the
y-axis occur, the governing equations may be written
(see Saltzman, 1962)

F) ay,v a0
Vey Ve) be Valt go—, (17)
ot O(a,2) ax
os -a(Y0)_ AT ay

at (mz) HX ax

Here ¥ is a stream function for the two-dimensional
motion, @ is the departure of ternperature from that
occurring in the state of no convection, and the con-
stants g, ow, v, and x denote, respectively, the acceleration
of gravity, the coefficient of thermal expansion, the
kinematic viscosity, and the thermal conductivity. The
problem is most tractable when both the upper and
lower boundaries are taken to be free, in which case
y¥ and V’p vanish at both boundaries.
Rayleigh found that fields of motion of the form

v= sin (weH~'x) sin (rH), (19)
d= 6, cos (raH—'x) sin (nH—2), (20)

would develop if the quantity
Ra= gal aT, (21)

now called the Rayleigh number, exceeded a critical value
R= ata" 1-+07)%. (22)

The minimum value of R,, namely 272'/4, occurs
when a?=4,.

Saltzman (1962) derived a set of ordinary differential
equations by expanding y and @ in double Fourier series
in x and z, with functions of ¢ alone for coefficients, and

substituting these series into (17) and (18). He arranged
the right-hand sides of the resulting equations in double-
Fourier-series form, by replacing products of trigono-
metric functions of # (or 2) by sums of trigonometric
functions, and then equated coefficients of similar func-
tions of x and z, He then reduced the resulting infinite
system to a finite system by omitting reference to all
but a specified finite set of functions of i, in the manner
proposed by the writer (1960).

He then obtained time-dependent solutions by nu-
merical integration. In certain cases all except three of
the dependent variables eventually tended to zero, and
these three variables underwent irregular, apparently
nonperiodic fluctuations.

These same solutions would have been obtained if the
series had at the start been truncated to include a total
of three terms. Accordingly, in this study we shall let

a(l+a%)"k- y= Xv2 sin (raH—x) sin (nH—2), (23)
wRoOR,AT—8= Yv2 cos (naH—x) sin (rH~12)
—Z sin (2rH~'z), (24)

where X, Y, and Z are functions of time alone. When
expressions (23) and (24) are substituted into (17) and
(18), and trigonometric terms other than those occurring
in (23) and (24) are omitted, we obtain the equations

x= ~ocX+eY, (25)
Yr=—XZ+#X—Y, (26)
Z= XY —bZ, (27)

Here a dot denotes a derivative with respect to the
dimensionless time r=a*H~*(1-+-@?)xt, while o= «7 is
the Prandil number, r=Ro'R,, and b=4(1+-22)-.
Except for multiplicative constants, our variables X, Y,
and Z are the same as Saltzman’s variables A, D, and
G. Equations (25), (26), and (27) are the convection
equations whose solutions we shall study.

Tn these equations X is proportional to the intensity
of the convective motion, while Y is proportional to the
temperature difference between the ascending and de-
scending currents, similar signs of X and Y denoting
that warm fluid is rising and cold fluid is descending.
The variable Z is proportional to the distortion of the
vertical temperature profile from linearity, a positive
value indicating that the strongest gradients occur near
the boundaries.

Equations (25)-(27) may give realistic results when
the Rayleigh number is slightly supercritical, but their
solutions cannot be expected to resemble those of (17)
and (18) when strong convection occurs, in view of the
extreme truncation.

6. Applications of linear theory

Although equations (25)-(27), as they stand, do not
have the form of (4), a number of linear transformations

EDWARD N. LORENZ

135

will convert them to this form. One of the simplest of
these is the transformation

NX, V'xV, Z=LZ—-r—a.

(28)

Solutions of (25)-(27) therefore remain bounded within
aregion R as + — ©, and the general results of Sections
2, 3 and 4 apply to these equations.

The stability of a solution X(r), ¥(7), 2(7) may be
formally investigated by considering the behavior of
small superposed perturbations zo(7), yo(r), o(r). Such
perturbations are temporarily governed by the linear-
ized equations

xoT -o a 0 Xo
[>| = Ke —1 “|| (29)
%o. ¥ xX —b Zo.

Since the coefficients in (29) vary with time, unless
the basic state X, Y, Z is a steady-state solution of
(25)~(27), a general solution of (29) is not feasible.
However, the variation of the volume V) of a small
region in phase space, as each point in the region is
displaced in accordance with (25)-(27), is determined
by the diagonal sum of the matrix of coefficients;
specifically

Ve=—(+O+-DV a (30)

This is perhaps most readily seen by visualizing the
motion in phase space as the flow of a fluid, whose
divergence is

ax: OF az
sat or +b 1). (31)
aX aY a4

Hence each small volume shrinks to zero as 7 + 2, at
a vate independent of X, Y, and Z. This does not imply
that each small volume shrinks to a point; it may simply
become flattened into a surface. It follows that the
volume of the region initially enclosed by the surface S
shrinks to zero at this same rate, so that all trajectories
ultimately become confined to a specific subspace
having zero volume. This subspace contains all those
trajectories which lie entirely within R, and so contains
all central trajectories.

Equations (25)~(27) possess the steady-state solution
X=Y=Z=0, representing the state of no convection.
With this basic solution, the characteristic equation of
the matrix in (29) is

[A+OIDIN-E (+ DA+-o(1—r)]=0. (32)

This equation has three real roots when r>0; all are
negative when 7<1, but one is positive when r> 1. The
criterion for the onset of convection is therefore r=1,
or R,=R,, in agreement with Rayleigh’s result.

When r> 1, equations (25)-(27) possess two additional
steady-state solutions X=V¥=4Vbr—D, Z=r—1.

--- Page 06 ---
136

For either of these solutions, the characteristic equation
of the matrix in (29) is

MA (e-bO+1)MéM+ (r+a)bd+20b(r—1)=0. (33)

This equation possesses one real negative root and two
complex conjugate roots when r>1; the complex con-
jugate roots are pure imaginary if the product of the
coefficients of 4% and d equals the constant term, or

r=o(e+b+3)(o~—b-1)-% (34)

This is the critical value of r for the instability of steady
convection. Thus if o<4+-1, no positive value of r
satisfies (34), and steady convection is always stable,
but if o>5-+1, steady convection is unstable for suffi-
ciently high Rayleigh numbers. This result of course
applies only to idealized convection governed by (25)-
(27), and not to the solutions of the partial differential
equations (17) and (18).

The presence of complex roots of (34) shows that if
unstable steady convection is disturbed, the motion will
oscillate in intensity. What happens when the disturb-
ances become large is not revealed by linear theory. To
investigate finite-amplitude convection, and to study
the subspace to which trajectories are ultimately con-
fined, we turn to numerical integration.

for instability of steady convection then occurs when
7=470/19= 24.74,

We shall choose the slightly supercritical value r= 28.
The states of steady convection are then represented by
the points (6v2, 6v2, 27) and (—6v2, ~6v2, 27) in phase
space, while the state of no convection corresponds to
the origin (0,0,0).

We have used the double-approximation procedure
for numerical integration, defined by (9), (10), and (14).
The value Ar=0.01 has been chosen for the dimension-
less time increment. The computations have been

puting machine. Approximately one second per itera-
tion, aside from output time, is required.

For initial conditions we have chosen a slight de-
parture from the state of no convection, namely (0,1,0).
‘Table 1 bas been prepared by the computer. It gives the
values of .V (the number of iterations), X, Y, and Z at
every fifth iteration for the first 160 iterations. In the
printed output (but not in the computations) the values
of X, ¥, and Z are multiplied by ten, and then only
those figures to the left of the decimal point are printed.
Thus the states of steady convection would appear as
0084, 0084, 0270 and —0084, —0084, 0270, while the
state of no convection would appear as 0000, 0000, 0000.
The initial instability of the state of rest is evident. All
three variables grow rapidly, as the sinking cold fluid
is replaced by even colder fluid from above, and the
rising warm fluid by warmer fluid from below, so that by
step 35 the strength of the convection far exceeds that
of steady convection, Then Y diminishes as the warm
fluid is carried over the top of the convective cells, so
that by step 50, when X and Y have opposite signs,
warm fluid is descending and cold fluid is ascending. The
motion thereupon ceases and reverses its direction, as
indicated by the negative values of X following step 60.
By step 85 the system has reached a state not far from
that of steady convection. Between steps 85 and 150 it
executes a complete oscillation in its intensity, the
slight amplification being almost indetectable.

The subsequent behavior of the system is illustrated
in Tig. 1, which shows the behavior of ¥ for the first
3000 iterations. After reaching its carly peak near step
35 and then approaching equilibrium near step 85, it
undergoes systematic amplified oscillations until near
step 1650, At this point a critical state is reached, and
thereafter Y changes sign at seemingly irregular inter-
vals, reaching sometimes one, sometimes two, and some-
times three or more extremes of one sign before changing
sign again.

Fig. 2 shows the projections on the X-Y- and F-Z-
planes in phase space of the portion of the trajectory
corresponding to iterations 1400-1900, The states of
steady convection are denoted by C and C’. The first
portion of the trajectory spirals outward from the
vicinity of C’, as the oscillations about the state of
eady convection, which have been occurring since step
5, continue to grow. Eventually, near step 1650, it
rosses the X-Z-plane, and is then deflected toward the
eighborhood of C. It temporarily spirals about C, but
rosses the X-Z-plane after one circuit, and returns to
@ neighborhood of C’, where it soon joins the spiral
over which it has previously traveled. Thereafter it
crosses from one spiral to the other at irregular intervals.

Fig. 3, in which the coordinates are F and Z, is based
upon the printed values of X, Y, and Z at every fifth
iteration for the first. 6000 iterations. These values deter-
mine X as a smooth single-valued function of ¥ and Z
over much of the range of Y and Z; they determine X

surfaces.

as one of two smooth single-valued functions over the
remainder of the range. In Fig, 3 the thin solid lines are
isopleths of X, and where two values of X exist, the
dashed lines are isopleths of the lower value. Thus,
within the limits of accuracy of the printed values, the
trajectory is confined to a pair of surfaces which appear
to merge in the lower portion of Fig. 3, The spiral about
C lies in the upper surface, while the spiral about C’ lies
in the lower surface. Thus it is possible for the trajectory
to pass back and forth from one spiral to the other
without intersecting itself.

Additional numerical solutions indicate that other
trajectories, originating at points well removed from
these surfaces, soon meet these surfaces. The surfaces
therefore appear to be composed of all points lying on
limiting trajectories.

Because the origin represents a steady state, no tra-
jectory can pass through it. However, two trajectories
emanate from it, ie., approach it asymptotically as
7 —, The heavy solid curve in Fig. 3, and its ex-
tensions as dotted curves, are formed by these two tra-
jectories. Trajectories passing close to the origin will
tend to follow the heavy curve, but will not cross it, so
that the heavy curve forms a natural boundary to the
region which a trajectory can ultimately occupy. The

holes near C and C’ also represent regions which cannot
be occupied after they have once been abandoned.

Returning to Fig, 2, we find that the trajectory ap-
parently leaves one spiral only after exceeding some
critical distance from the center. Moreover, the extent
to which this distance is exceeded appears to determine
the point at which the next spiral is entered; this in turn
seems to determine the number of circuits to be executed
before changing spirals again.

It therefore seems that some single feature of given
circuit should predict the same feature of the following
circuit. A suitable feature of this sort is the maximum
value of Z, which occurs when a circuit is nearly com-
pleted. Table 2 has again been prepared by the com-
puter, and shows the values of X, Y, and Z at only those
iterations V for which Z has a relative maximum. The
succession of circuits about C and C’ is indicated by the
succession of positive and negative values of X and Y.
Evidently X and ¥ change signs following 4 maximum
which exceeds some critical value printed as about 385.

Fig. 4 has been prepared from Table 2. The abscissa
is M,, the value of the zth maximum of Z, while the
ordinate is M41, the valuc of the following maximum.
Each point represents a pair of successive values of 7
taken from Table 2. Within the limits of the round-off

in tabulating Z, there is a precise two-to-one relation
between M, and M41. The initial maximum 1/,=483
is shown as if it had followed a maximum M)=385,
since maxima near 385 are followed by close approaches
to the origin, and then by exceptionally large maxima,

It follows that an investigator, unaware of the nature
of the governing equations, could formulate an empirical
prediction scheme from the “data” pictured in Tigs, 2
and 4, From the value of the most recent maximum of
Z, values at future maxima may be obtained by repeated
applications of Fig. 4. Values of X, Y, and Z between
maxima of Z may be found from Fig. 2, by interpolating
between neighboring curves. Of course, the accuracy of
predictions made by this method is limited by the
exactness of Figs. 2 and 4, and, as we shall see, by the
accuracy with which the initial values of X, Y, and Z
are observed.

Some of the implications of Fig. 4 are revealed by
considering an idealized two-to-one correspondence be-
tween successive members of sequences Mo, Mi, ---,
consisting of numbers between zero and one. These
sequences satisfy the relations

Mii=2M, if M,.<
Maj1 isundefined if Mn=% (35)
Mup=2-2M, if Ma>t.

The correspondence defined by (35) is shown in Fig. 5,
which is an idealization of Fig, 4. It follows from re-
peated applications of (35) that in any particular
sequence,

M = m,42"°M,

(36)

where is an even integer.

Consider first a sequence where M@y=#/2?, where 2 is
odd, In this case 44,-1=3, and the sequence terminates.
These sequences form a denumerable set, and corre-
spond to the trajectories which score direct hits upon the
state of no convection.

Next consider a sequence where Mo=1/2?v, where #
and » are relatively prime odd numbers. Then if &>0,
Morten = t/2, where u, and v are relatively prime and
uw is even. Since for any v the number of proper fractions
u,/v is finite, repetitions must occur, and the sequence
is periodic. These sequences also form a denumerable
set, and correspond to periodic trajectories.

The periodic sequences having a given number of
distinct values, or phases, are readily tabulated. In
particular there are a single one-phase, a single two-
phase, and two three-phase sequences, namely,

2/3, °°,

2/5, 4/5, ---,
2/7, 4/7, 6/7, «+,

The two three-phase sequences differ qualitatively in
that the former possesses two numbers, and the latter
only one number, exceeding 3. Thus the trajectory corre-
sponding to the former makes two circuits about C,
followed by one about C’ (or vice versa). The trajectory
corresponding to the latter makes three circuits about C,
followed by three about C’, so that actually only Z
varies in three phases, while X and F vary in six.
Now consider a sequence where My is not a rational
fraction. In this case (36) shows that Jf,4, cannot equal

ucnces, which form a nondenumerable set, may con-
ceivably approach periodic sequences asymptotically
and be quasi-periodic, or they may be nonperiodic.
Finally, consider two sequences My, Mi, and
My’, My’, +++, where Mo'=Mo+e. Then for a given &,
if ¢ is sufficiently small, Mf,’=My-2*e, All sequences
are therefore unstable with respect to small modifica-
tions. In particular, all periodic sequences are unstable,
and no other sequences can approach them asymptoti-
cally. All sequences except a set of measure zero are
therefore nonperiodic, and correspond to nonperiodic
trajectories, .

Returning to Fig, 4, we see that periodic sequences
analogous to those tabulated above can be found. They
are given approximately by

The trajectories possessing these or other periodic se-
quences of maxima are presumably periodic or quasi-
periodic themselves.

The above sequences are temporarily approached in
the numerical solution by sequences beginning at itera-
tions 5340, 4881, 3625, and 3926. Since the numerical
solution eventually departs from each of these se-
uences, each is presumably unstable.

More generally, if M,’= Mf,+¢, and if eis sufficiently
small, M ups’=MasetAe, where A is the product of the
slopes of the curve in Fig. 4 at the points whose abscissas
are Mn, +>, Mnyx-1. Since the curve apparently has a
slope whose magnitude exceeds unity everywhere, all
sequences of maxima, and hence all trajectories, are
unstable. In particular, the periodic trajectories, whose
sequences of maxima form a denumerable set, are un-
stable, and only exceptional trajectories, having the
same sequences of maxima, can approach them asymp-
totically. The remaining trajectories, whose sequences
of maxima form a nondenumerable set, therefore repre-
sent deterministic nonperiodic flow.

These conclusions have been based upon a finite seg-
ment of a numerically determined solution. They cannot
be regarded as mathematically proven, even though the
evidence for them is strong. One apparent contradiction
requires further examination.

Tt is difficult to reconcile the merging of two surfaces,
one containing each spiral, with the inability of two
trajectories to merge. It is not difficult, however, to
explain the apparent merging of the surfaces. At twa
times 75 and 71, the volumes occupied by a specified set
of particles satisfy the relation

Vola) = eet ot i Vary), (37)

according to (30). A typical circuit about C or C’ re-
quires about 70 iterations, so that, for such a circuit,

THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES VoLuMme 20
te=71+0.7, and, since ¢+8+1=41/3,
Vo(r1) =0.00007 V(r). (38)

Two particles separated from each other in a suitable
direction can therefore come together very rapidly, and
appear to merge.

It would. seem, then, that the two surfaces mercly
appear to merge, and remain distinct surfaces, Following
these surfaces along a path parallel to a trajectory, and
circling C or C’, we see that each surface is really a pair
of surfaces, so that, where they appear to merge, there
are really four surfaces. Continuing this process for
another circuit, we see that there are really eight sur-
faces, etc., and we finally conclude that there is an
infinite complex of surfaces, each extremely close to one
or the other of two merging surfaces.

The infinite set of values at which a line parallel to the
X-axis intersects these surfaces may be likened to the
set of all numbers between zcro and one whose decimal
expansions (or some other expansions besides binary)
contain only zeros and ones. This set is plainly non-
denumerable, in view of its correspondence to the set of
all numbers between zero and one, expressed in binary.
Nevertheless it forms a set of measure zero. The se-
quence of ones and zeros corresponding to a particular
surface contains a history of the trajectories lying in that
surface, a one or zero immediately to the right of the
decimal point indicating that the last circuit was about
C or C’, respectively, a one or zero in second place
giving the same information about the next to the last
circuit, etc. Repeating decimal expansions represent
periodic or quasi-periodic trajectories, and, since they
define rational fractions, they form a denumerable set.

If one first visualizes this infinite complex of surfaces,
it should not be difficult to picture nonperiodic deter-
ministic trajectories embedded in these surfaces.

8. Conclusion

Certain mechanically or thermally forced noncon-
servative hydrodynamical systems may exhibit either
periodic or irregular behavior when there is no obviously
related periodicity or irregularity in the forcing process.
Both periodic and nonpcriodic flow are observed in some
experimental models when the forcing process is held
constant, within the limits of experimental control.
Some finite systems of ordinary differential equations
designed to represent these hydrodynamical systems
possess periodic analytic solutions when the forcing is
strictly constant. Other such systems have yielded non-
periodic numerical solutions.

A finite system of ordinary differential equations
representing forced dissipative flow often has the prop-
erty that all of its solutions are ultimately confined
within the same bounds. We have studied in detail the
properties of solutions of systems of this sort. Our
principal results concern the instability of nonperiodic
solutions. A nonperiodic solution with no transient com-

ponent must be unstable, in the sense that solutions
temporarily approximating it do not continue to do so.
A nonperiodic solution with a transient component is
sometimes stable, but in this case its stability is one of
its transient properties, which tends to die out.

To verify the existence of deterministic nonperiodic
flow, we have obtained numerical solutions of a system
of three ordinary differential equations designed to
represent a convective process, These equations possess
three steady-state solutions and a denumerably infinite
set of periodic solutions. All solutions, and in particular
the periodic solutions, are found to be unstable. The
remaining solutions therefore cannot in general ap-
proach the periodic solutions asymptotically, and so are
nonperiodic.

When our results concerning the instability of non-
periodic flow are applied to the atmosphere, which is
ostensibly nonperiodic, they indicate that prediction of
the sufficiently distant future is impossible by any
method, unless the present conditions are known ex-
actly. In view of the inevitable inaccuracy and incom-
pleteness of weather observations, precise very-long-
range forecasting would seem to be non-existent.

There remains the question as to whether our results
really apply to the atmosphere. One does not usually
regard the atmosphere as either deterministic or finite,
and the lack of periodicity is not a mathematical cer-
tainty, since the atmosphere has not been observed
forever.

The foundation of our principal result is the eventual
necessity for any bounded system of finite dimension-
ality to come arbitrarily close to acquiring a state which
it has previously assumed. If the system is stable, its
future development will then remain arbitrarily close
to its past history, and it will be quasi-periodic.

In the case of the atmosphere, the crucial point is
then whether analogues must have occurred since the
state of the atmosphere was first observed. By ana-
logues, we mean specifically two or more states of the
atmosphere, together with its environment, which re-
semble each other so closely that the differences may
be ascribed to errors in observation. Thus, to be analo-
gues, two states must be closely alike in regions where
observations are accurate and plentiful, while they need
not be at ail alike in regions where there are no observa-
tions at all, whether these be regions of the atmosphere
or the environment. If, however, some unobserved fea-
tures are implicit in a succession of observed states,
two successions of states must be nearly alike in order
to be analogues.

Tf it is truc that two analogues have occurred since
atmospheric observation first began, it follows, since the
atmosphere has not been observed to be periodic, that
the successions of states following these analogues must
eventually have differed, and no forccasting scheme
could have given correct results both times. If, instead,

EDWARD N.

LORENZ 141

analogues have not occurred during this period, some
accurate very-long-range prediction scheme, using ob-
servations at present available, may exist. But, if it
does exist, the atmosphere will acquire a quasi-periodic
behavior, never to be lost, once an analogue occurs. This
quasi-periodic behavior need not be established, though,
even if very-long-range forecasting is feasible, if the
variety of possible atmospheric states is so immense
that analogues need never occur. It should be noted
that these conclusions do not depend upon whether or
not the atmosphere is deterministic.

There remains the very important question as to how
long is “very-long-range.”” Our results do not give the
answer for the atmosphere; conceivably it could be a
few days or a few centuries. In an idealized system,
whether it be the simple convective model described
here, or a complicated system designed to resemble the
atmosphere as closcly as possible, the answer may be
obtained by comparing pairs of numerical solutions
having nearly identical initial conditions. In the case of
the real atrnosphere, if all other methods fail, we can
wait for an analogue.
