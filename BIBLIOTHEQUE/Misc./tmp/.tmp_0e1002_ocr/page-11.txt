ponent must be unstable, in the sense that solutions
temporarily approximating it do not continue to do so.
A nonperiodic solution with a transient component is
sometimes stable, but in this case its stability is one of
its transient properties, which tends to die out.

To verify the existence of deterministic nonperiodic
flow, we have obtained numerical solutions of a system
of three ordinary differential equations designed to
represent a convective process, These equations possess
three steady-state solutions and a denumerably infinite
set of periodic solutions. All solutions, and in particular
the periodic solutions, are found to be unstable. The
remaining solutions therefore cannot in general ap-
proach the periodic solutions asymptotically, and so are
nonperiodic.

When our results concerning the instability of non-
periodic flow are applied to the atmosphere, which is
ostensibly nonperiodic, they indicate that prediction of
the sufficiently distant future is impossible by any
method, unless the present conditions are known ex-
actly. In view of the inevitable inaccuracy and incom-
pleteness of weather observations, precise very-long-
range forecasting would seem to be non-existent.

There remains the question as to whether our results
really apply to the atmosphere. One does not usually
regard the atmosphere as either deterministic or finite,
and the lack of periodicity is not a mathematical cer-
tainty, since the atmosphere has not been observed
forever.

The foundation of our principal result is the eventual
necessity for any bounded system of finite dimension-
ality to come arbitrarily close to acquiring a state which
it has previously assumed. If the system is stable, its
future development will then remain arbitrarily close
to its past history, and it will be quasi-periodic.

In the case of the atmosphere, the crucial point is
then whether analogues must have occurred since the
state of the atmosphere was first observed. By ana-
logues, we mean specifically two or more states of the
atmosphere, together with its environment, which re-
semble each other so closely that the differences may
be ascribed to errors in observation. Thus, to be analo-
gues, two states must be closely alike in regions where
observations are accurate and plentiful, while they need
not be at ail alike in regions where there are no observa-
tions at all, whether these be regions of the atmosphere
or the environment. If, however, some unobserved fea-
tures are implicit in a succession of observed states,
two successions of states must be nearly alike in order
to be analogues.

Tf it is truc that two analogues have occurred since
atmospheric observation first began, it follows, since the
atmosphere has not been observed to be periodic, that
the successions of states following these analogues must
eventually have differed, and no forccasting scheme
could have given correct results both times. If, instead,

analogues have not occurred during this period, some
accurate very-long-range prediction scheme, using ob-
servations at present available, may exist. But, if it
does exist, the atmosphere will acquire a quasi-periodic
behavior, never to be lost, once an analogue occurs. This
quasi-periodic behavior need not be established, though,
even if very-long-range forecasting is feasible, if the
variety of possible atmospheric states is so immense
that analogues need never occur. It should be noted
that these conclusions do not depend upon whether or
not the atmosphere is deterministic.

There remains the very important question as to how
long is “very-long-range.”” Our results do not give the
answer for the atmosphere; conceivably it could be a
few days or a few centuries. In an idealized system,
whether it be the simple convective model described
here, or a complicated system designed to resemble the
atmosphere as closcly as possible, the answer may be
obtained by comparing pairs of numerical solutions
having nearly identical initial conditions. In the case of
the real atrnosphere, if all other methods fail, we can
wait for an analogue.
