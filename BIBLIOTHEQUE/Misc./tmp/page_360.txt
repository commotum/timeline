ded in the Soar total cognitive system, and there are sources of
variability in the interior milieu that haven't been accounted for, so
it is premature to worry too strongly about the differences in learn-
ing rates. But it is an important gap in Soar as a unified theory of
cognition that needs to be accounted for at the proper time.

The Seibel task of Figure 6-17 is artificial in several ways, not just
because it is a laboratory task but because we simply posited the
encoding for Soar. There is no easy way to avoid something like
this, given that Soar lacks the perception and motor capabilities
that a human has. However, we can look for a natural example of
learning in Soar. Figure 6-18 was plotted from a set of 30 consecu-
tive runs of R1-Soar on a collection of {5 tasks. It can be seen that
again Soar exhibits a power law. It appears very noisy, but this is
because each point is a single learning trial, whereas in Figure 6-17
the data are grouped in fives (and the human data in Figure 1-3 are
grouped in sets of 1,024}.

The Soar mechanisms that produce the power law are clear.
Thus, we can apply the general scheme to a well-known series of.
studies by Paul Kolers (1975, 1976) on reading geometrically trans-
formed text. Figure 6-19 shows at the top a sentence of inverted
text. True to form, human practice in reading this type of text
follows the power law, as we showed in Figure 3-12. People start
out reading backward at a much slower rate than normal reading
rates, and as they read more and more pages they get better and
