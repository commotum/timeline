One of the foremost developments in experimental cognitive psy-
chology over the last decade has been the establishment of the
automatic/controlled distinction. The label gained prominence after
a famous pair of papers by Richard Shiffrin and Walter Schneider
(1977), but the distinction began to be emphasized a little earlier
(Posner & Snyder, 1975; Laberge & Samuels, 1974). The underly-
ing intuition is that automatic behavior occurs by parallel process-
ing and controlled behavior occurs by serial processing. But a
whole battery of behavioral indicators separates the two types of
processing, as shown in Figure 3-7, An automatic process can’t be
inhibited from being initiated. It is relatively fast. It takes the same
time (or almost so) independent of the stimulus load. It cannot be
terminated as a function of internal conditions (it is exhaustive). No
detailed awareness exists of what processes are being carried out. If
the task is perceptual, the answer appears to pop out. A controlled
process has contrasting values for each of these attributes.

Figure 3-8 provides an example of this distinction, taken from
Schneider and Shiffrin (1977). It shows the results of a single ex-
perimental task with two different conditions, one that results in
automatic behavior and the other in controlled behavior. The essen-
tial experimental arrangement is shown across the top. The person

ately analyzed after the fact, but that wouldn't affect the automatic character of each
slementary deliberation. In a system that operates contiauously in real time, such a
scheme would raise some interesting issues about how to decide whether to use such
records and on what time scale.
