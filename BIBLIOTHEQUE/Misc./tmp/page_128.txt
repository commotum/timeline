Human Cognitive Architecture = 115

They also dance, write books, build houses, and have conversa-
ons. A conversation, whatever else it might be, is an opportunity
to interact with the environment in a way that is different from prior
interactions—that is, to build new response functions. Think of the
Library of Congress as evidence of the variety of response func-
tions that humans have exhibited by writing books, will exhibit by
reading them, and want to exhibit by building buildings to make
them available. To academics the mention of books suggests intel-
lectual functions, as if all this was perhaps a phenomenon of the
high end of the socioeconomic scale. What then of rapping? A
creation of the black ghetto, rapping is a social invention to produce
an opportunity for new responses to a highly dynamic environment.
It serves other functions as well, but it builds on the human procliy-
ity to invent new forms of responses. People create these opportu-
nities. Indeed, our Martian biologist would not be wrong to con-
clude that the biggest biological puzzle about earthlings is why they
have developed this efflorescence of adaptation.!

Ethology, looking at other organisms from digger wasps to her-
ring gulls (Tinbergen, 1960, 1969), has properly become intrigued
with the adaptations they exhibit. Each adaptation is seen as a
unique biological phenomenon, to be curated one by one. Each is to
be understood by exploring the behavioral and physiological mech-
anisms that support it. Not so with humans. There is no enumerat-
ing their adaptations—they will invent new adaptations faster than
they can be recorded. The act of recording is itself one more adap-
tation—or rather a whole generator of adaptations, as the problems
of such an ethnological scientific enterprise unfold and are re-
sponded to.

What I am saying here is not new, nor is it supposed to be. There
are many ways of talking about the life of Homo sapiens so as to
teveal the nature of the life of the mind. Always the same extraordi-
nary characteristics of man as a biological organism are to be de-
scribed. The issue is what it takes to convince ourselves that
humans deal with so much variety that they must be symbol
systems—that no system of less power and universality could
suffice. | am attempting a description that takes as the givens obser-

1. Of course, if it could puzzte about it, then the Martian might a fortiori know the
answer, because it would exhibit that same efflorescence. But no metaphor can be per-
fect.
