molecules in some places as inputs and some as outputs. This pro-
duces a pretty big class of functions, though not quite as big per-
haps as if we had adopted a richer chemical notion of molecules.
But then we could consider that latter class of machines as well.
Thus, we can work at the high end, where we consider very large
classes of functions.

It turns out that universal machines exist for these large classes,
Again, this comes as no surprise to us, familiar as we are with
general digital computers, which are indeed universal machines.
Conceptually, of course, this puts the cart before the horse. We are
interested in what we should believe about the digital computer’s
ability to generate many different functions. We should not be using
our intuitions about the computer to confirm for us that indeed
computers can realize an immense variety of functions. In other
words, the existence of universal machines gives us confidence that
computers can exist that provide very large families of functions.

A limitation of these results would seem to be that the notion ofa
universal machine is relative to the class of machines, There would
be universal machines for machines constructed with gears and
pulleys, say, and universal machines for valence-style molecules.
These two universal machines would clearly be different, but this
turns out not to be a limitation after all. Investigations of univer-
sality have been carried out for many different ways of defining
machines—where one tries to be as general as possible in the no-
tion of machine. Computer scientists have analyzed Turing ma-
chines, Markov algorithms, Post production systems, recursive
functions (which can be viewed as a form of machine), many varia-
tions on digital computers (such as models of random-access ma-
chines), and so on, Always, for these highly general classes of
machines, universal machines exist. Furthermore, the classes of
functions turn out always to be the same, once the ability is granted
to transform inputs’ to inputs and outputs to outputs’, as in panel D
of Figure 2-8. The upshot is that there is a single largest class of
functions that can be realized by physical devices (machines). Not
surprisingly, these have come to be called the computable functions
and the machines that compute them are called universal com-
puters. Thus, the answer to the question what functions can be
computed, though not quite the simplest possible, turns out to be
extremely elegant.

The way this issue has been formulated in theoretical computer
