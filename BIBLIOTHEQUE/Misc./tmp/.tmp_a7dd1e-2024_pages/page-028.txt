                     The AI assistant’s mathematical reasoning capabilities are vital for accurately solving and
                     explaining mathematical problems posed by ‘Human’. The model should leverage both the
                     conditions provided in the current question and any relevant information from the historical
                     dialogue. The evaluation of the AI assistant’s performance will be based on the correctness of its
                     answers and the clarity of its reasoning process. The evaluation criteria are as follows:
                     1.   Verify the accuracy of the AI assistant’s answer against the provided reference solu-
                     tion in the format ‘### reference solution ###’ for the mathematical problem.
                     2. Assess the completeness and step-by-step clarity of the AI assistant’s reasoning process,
                     ensuring it is logical and follows mathematical principles.
                     3. Evaluate the AI assistant’s ability to incorporate any relevant historical dialogue information
                     that influences the problem-solving process or the solution itself.
                     4. Appraise the AI assistant’s communication of the solution in a manner that is understandable
                     and instructive to ‘Human’, potentially aiding their learning or comprehension.
                     Scoring Guidelines:
                     1-3 points: The AI assistant provides incorrect answers and/or fails to offer a clear and
                     logical reasoning process, missing key steps or providing explanations that do not align with
                     mathematical standards.
                     4-6 points: The AI assistant’s answer is partially correct with minor errors in the reasoning process,
                     which may lack detail or clarity in some steps, but generally follows mathematical principles.
                     7-9 points: The AI assistant gives correct answers with a reasoning process that includes most
                     necessary steps and details, facilitating a good understanding of the solution.
                     10 points: The AI assistant provides a completely correct answer accompanied by a detailed
                     and meticulously clear step-by-step reasoning process that is fully aligned with mathematical
                     principles and enhances ‘Human’s understanding.
                     When scoring, focus on the precision of the AI assistant’s answer and the extent to which the
                     reasoning process is elaborated. The assistant’s ability to effectively communicate complex mathe-
                     matical solutions in a manner that supports ‘Human’s learning is indicative of high performance. If

                     Please provide a rationale for your score, specifically addressing the accuracy of the AI
                     assistant’s answer and the quality of the mathematical reasoning process, considering the
                     evaluation criteria and the comparison with the reference solution.
