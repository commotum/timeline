1.1.4. What Is a Theory?

The points brought out by these three examples make evident what
I mean by a theory, generally speaking. This view of theory, by the
way, I take to be unexceptional—even old-fashioned. It is just the
notion developed by any working scientist who uses successful
scientific theory—in chemistry, physics, biology, geology, meteo-
rology. There are a lot of such people around, and they learn and
use a lot of theory every day. That's why I call it old-fashioned.
There are no surprises or new wrinkles due to the theory being
about human behavior—no notion that, because we are dealing
with human behavior, or ourselves, or thinking beings, or what-
ever, that somehow there should be something special about what a
theory means or does.

To state it positively and in general, let there be some body of
explicit knowledge, from which answers can be obtained to ques-
tions by inquiries. Some answers might be predictions, some might
be explanations, some might be prescriptions for control. If this
body of knowledge yields answers to those questions for you, you
can call it a theory. There is little sense worrying that one body of
knowledge is ‘‘just a collection of facts’’ (such as a data base of
people's heights and ages) and another is ‘‘the fundamental axioms
of a subject matter” (such as Newton’s three laws plus supporting
explication). The difference, of course, is important. But it is clear
what is going on—they answer different sorts of questions and have

_ different scope and have different potential for further develop-

ment. That is, they are indeed different bodies of knowledge. But
both play a role in providing needed answers, and neither substi-
tutes for the other, except in special cases.

The theory gives the answers, not the theorist. That is important,
because humans also embody knowledge and can answer ques-
tions. Humans (as question answerers) and theories have different

: properties. People often can’t provide much additional knowledge

about why their answers are right or to what approximation. They
also tend to argue a lot about their answers and tend to serve their
own goals in giving answers—all of which complicates matters. In
contrast, a theory is an explicit body of knowledge, from which
answers can be obtained by anyone skilled in the art. What ques-
tions can be answered by a theory may well depend on the skill of
the theorist, but the answer itself, if obtained, does not—it depends
