             Extended Data Fig. 3 | Side-by-side comparison of human proof and                  than 100 deduction steps, with many low-level steps that are extremely tedious 
             AlphaGeometry proof for the IMO 2000 P6. This is a harder problem                  to a human reader. This is a case in which the search-based solution is much less 
             (average human score = 1.05/7), with a large number of objects in the problem      readable and much less intuitive than coordinate bashing. A more structural 
             statements, resulting in a very crowded diagram. Left, the human solution uses     organization, that is, a high-level proof outline, can improve readability of the 
             complex numbers. With a well-chosen coordinate system, the problem is greatly      AlphaGeometry solution substantially. Again, this suggests building into 
             simplified and a solution follows naturally through algebraic manipulation.        AlphaGeometry many higher-level deduction rules to encapsulate large groups 
             Right, AlphaGeometry solution involves two auxiliary constructions and more        of low-level deductions into fewer proof steps.
