worlds, as shown in the right-hand column, and are described by
different theories.

This figure provides an overview of where we are going. Starting
at the bottom, there is the biological band of three levels—neurons;
organelles, which are a factor of ten down from neurons; and
neural circuits, a factor of ten up. As we'll see, neurons have a
characteristic operation time of about a ms (~~1 ms), and neural
circuits of about 10 ms (~~ 10 ms). Above the biological band, there
is the cognitive band. Here the levels are unfamiliar—I’ve called
them the deliberate act, cognitive operation, and unit task, each of
which takes about ten times (~~ 10) as long as the act at the level
beneath. It will be the main task of this chapter to establish these
