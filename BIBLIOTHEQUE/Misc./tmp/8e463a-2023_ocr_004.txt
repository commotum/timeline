knowledge association abilities when faced with
new knowledge. To enable a more detailed assess-
ment, we design diverse categories of questions to
evaluate each ability, as shown on the right side of
Figure 1.

Specifically, we sample some attribute triplets in
the variation set 7;?(é) and the dropout set T(é)
to create KD question set, which is ideally suited
for evaluating the knowledge differentiation abil-
ity of a model to distinguish between the parent
entity e? existing in its internal knowledge and the
newly constructed artificial entity € provided in the
context.

The proficiency of LLMs in reasoning along
mastered knowledge graph has been demonstrated
in previous studies (Hu et al., 2022; Choudhary
and Reddy, 2023). However, it remains uncertain
whether it can effectively establish connection be-
tween newly encountered artificial entity and the
existing knowledge for multi-hop reasoning task.
To investigate this, we incorporate the relations of
artificial entity to construct a new graph, which en-
compasses both existing entities and the artificial
entity. We then perform a breadth-first-search on
the relation graph to identify a chain of relation
triplets 7c with the artificial entity serving as root
(e.g., [(Alcuna, Eaten by, Jaguar), (Jaguar, Com-
pete with, Maned Wolf)]), and then utilize the chain
to generate a multi-hop question q(Tc) (e.g., What
organism is the competitor of the Alcuna’s natu-
ral enemy?). We group such questions into KA
question set.

For the rest of the artificial entity’s property

triplets, we utilize them to evaluate the ability of
remembering and understanding new knowledge
by simply asking questions about the objects in
triplets. We group such questions into KU question
set.

3 ALCUNA: Our Benchmark

With our proposed method, one can create a large
amount of new entities quickly based on exist-
ing structured knowledge. A natural attempt is
to construct new organisms on already discovered
ones, since the biological taxonomy is perfectly
adapted to our proposed approach. Therefore, we
utilize KnowGen to propose ALCUNA, a biological
dataset for evaluating the ability of the model in
face of new knowledge as shown in Figure 1.

3.1 EOL Database

We utilize the structured data from the EOL? (Ency-
clopedia of Life) database (Parr et al., 2014) to pro-
vide existing knowledge, which is an online, freely
accessible database that aims to provide informa-
tion about all known species on Earth. EOL orga-
nizes all biological taxons into a taxonomic tree,
in which each entity belongs to a class. The most
intriguing feature of EOL is that it constructs rich
structured data in the form of key-value pairs for
each biological entity, including taxonomic rank,
attributes, relationships and information source. As
a whole, it contains 2404790 entities with a total
of 13625612 properties consisted of 669 property
types. The substantial volume of data, coupled with
