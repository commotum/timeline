288 = Unified Theories of Cognition

the number of regularities could probably be pushed toward 50 or
even higher, for the Sternberg phenomena have received extensive
attention from the experimental community. Added to the list of
regularities in typing, this list supports my claim about the Great
Psychology Data Puzzie. Any theory of cognition must ultimately
explain all these regularities and more. Any theory that gets through
the eye of this needle, with its ~~3,000 obstructing filaments, is
likely to enter the heaven of being fundamentally correct.

We should not be diverted to examine all the regularities of Fig-
ure 5-14, but a few are worth touching on, We have already dis-
cussed the first three, linearity, fast processing, and parailel re-
sponse. (4) There are no serial position effects—it doesn’t matter
where in the list the digit occurs that matches the probe. (5) There is
no awareness of the processing details—people do not know how
they do the task. These five regularities comprise a basic set whose
joint occurrence are the signature of the Sternberg effect.

(6) The basic set of phenomena is found for fixed or varied sets.
With a fixed set, the targets are presented at the beginning of a
block of trials and then held constant, while probe after probe is
presented. With a varied set, a fresh set of targets is presented just
before each probe. The results are the same in both cases. (7) The
basic phenomena are found whether the modality of presentation is
visual or auditory. We have looked at only the first seven regu-
larities, but this is enough to see that each one adds strong con-
straints to the nature of the architecture. Some implications of these
constraints are reasonably clear, even without detailed analysis to
Separate out the contribution of the architecture from that of the
memory content. Such implications serve to eliminate outlandish
architectures. The central issue, however, is what architecture is
consistent with aif of them-——and that is a constraint of a different
color.

Because of the puzzling fact that simple terminating search does
not explain the basic, highly regular data, a great deal of theoretical
activity has been invested in the Sternberg phenomena. The first
alternative model, put forward by Sternberg himself early on, was
exhaustive search. It was easy enough to stipulate a computational
structure with this property, but it never had any particular reason
for existing. Both models were serial. Soon various parallel models
were invented that would yield the basic phenomena, then even
some self-terminating serial searches that would. The models have
