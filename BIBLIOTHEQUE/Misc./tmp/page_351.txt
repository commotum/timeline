them from the experimenter, because the experimenter doesn’t
know what is in the subject’s mind that might be confusing to the
subject. Indeed, the subject doesn't know either, until the confu-
sion occurs.

Again, there must be a self-posed task for the study trial. This is
to try to recall the object using cues—not using prespecified cues,
but whatever cues happen to be around, which of course includes
what the experimenter has provided. Soar starts with a free recall,
in order to obtain what arrives naturally. This is the previous task in
which all the candidates rain down. The experiment assures that in
the test trial the item will have the given cue, ((a 6), . . .}, so the
candidates that arrive in the rain of candidates can be tested for
having this cue. There are three possible outcomes. First, there
may be no candidates that have the cue. Then Soar must do what it
does in the free-recall study task in order to be able to generate the
candidate. Second, there may be exactly one candidate that has the
cue. Then Soar can do no better than to take it as the correct
recollection and extract its response part, fc d),, to use for the
response.

Third, there may be several candidates with the cue. Then the
problem is how to distinguish the right one from all the other dis-
tractors. This shows up as a tie impasse (as always) and Soar goes
into a problem space to resolve the tie. In this selection space
(which is different from the look-ahead space used in the blocks-
world task in Figure 4-10), it applies a discrimination operator. This
operator takes one of the tied items and compares it to the input
item to find something that discriminates the two of them on the
basis of their cue parts. Remember, only the cue part of the correct
item will be available at test. Having discovered a discriminating
feature, Soar can use it to reject the alternative. That is, it executes
an operator that puts in a rejection preference and that provides the
solution to the self-posed task. Then Soar creates a chunk that
automatically puts in a rejection when the stimulus cue is present
and when a retrieved candidate has the given feature. There might
be several distractor candidates; then the discrimination operator
may have to be applied several times—though not necessarily once
for each candidate, because a given feature may discriminate sev-
eral candidates.

When a test trial occurs, Soar opens up and lets all the candidates
rain down, All three results are still possible. First, no items at all
