knowledge, going back to the prior analogous situation is a local
response and a rational one at that. Furthermore, it seems natural
to enter into that prior situation attempting to solve the present
problem, not simply adopting the prior solution by rote. All this
corresponds to what is going on with revision problem spaces.

Although we have not capitalized on it here, it is useful to remem-
ber, once again, that all this is occurring within Soar as a unified
theory. Consequently, general psychological plausibility carries
over into this situation and operates as general support for this
theory of transition mechanisms. It also operates to provide many
specific constraints with which to test the theory and confront it
with evidence from quite distant parts of cognitive psychology.

Finally, let us come back to the dilemma and its horns. The
solution that arises from Soar clearly opts for one horn—devel-
opment occurs by learning. What, then, about the associated ques-
tion of why development takes so long? It seems to me the answer
is composed of three parts—three reasons that conjointly stretch
out the time it takes for children to complete development.

First, children have only a limited time to spend on specific tasks.
Kids have lots of things to do with their lives. They do not spend
months and months doing the balance-beam task. The world of
behavior requiring development occupies an immense volume, so
to speak, and in consequence any one piece of it moves relatively
slowly. Furthermore, development isn’t deliberate on the part of
children; they have no strategy for making it happen (though their
parents and teachers sometimes do). Development is just some-
thing that happens. Undoubtedly, this is one reason for the appar-
ently slow pace of development, even though it is independent of
the detailed mechanisms of development as proposed by Soar (or
any other theory). Second, the nature of the process, as revealed in
Figure 8-7, is quite complex. Actually, learning doesn’t take so
long. As we noted earlier, Soar can move through its problem
spaces quite rapidly. Rather, the compound character of the pro-
cess—the number of different activities that enter into the whole—
simply adds up to a long period of development. Even without a
detailed theory of errors, it can be seen that there are manifold
ways in which the transition sequence shown here can go astray on
any particular trial. In general, just comparing mechanisms would
imply that relearning is an order of magnitude slower than new
learning. Development is a prototypical example of relearning, for
