many different architectures. (The only constraint seems to be that,
by definition, a given architecture must realize a specific symbol
system.) The variety is so great that we do not have any structural
characterizations of its limits. All our characterizations are basi-
cally functional, such as the analysis of symbol systems that ted to
Figure 2-11. Essentially nothing is known about characterizing the
Properties of the machinery—except that it must provide these
functions.

The only structural invariance I know is an empirical one—the
computer-systems hierarchy of Figure 2-3, No matter what we do in
computer science and engineering, this hierarchy appears to remain
unshakable, The hierarchy did not emerge right away. Originally,
there was essentially a fixed Structure, the famous four boxes as
shown in Figure 2-15, which could be found in any early textbook,
such as Ware (1962). Architectures, as they are described here,
emerged in the 1960s, when the complexity of the systems finally
increased because of the decreasing cost of hardware and its in-

, Creasing reliability (Bell & Newell, 1971). The enabling key appears
* to be the development of the register-transfer level, which is a sys-
tem level with which one can describe complex architectures.
Originally, there was only the logic level of combinational and se-
quential circuits built around the single binary variable (0 or 1).
Since the register-transfer levet was formulated in the 1960s, it has
retained its basic form. The computer field has gone through radical
transformations in technology, from individual logic components to
ICs (integrated circuits) and on up the various scales of integration,
