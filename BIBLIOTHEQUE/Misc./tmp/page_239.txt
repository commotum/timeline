226 # Unified Thearies of Cognition

The general mapping of Figure 4-23 seems to be the only one
possible for Soar. That is, it is not possible to make Soar produc-
tions correspond to something that happens at the ~~100 ms or the
~~ sec level. Nothing else fits. Soar might not be right—as with
all theories about the real world, it could be a little bit wrong or it
could be just plain wrong. Either option, or anything in between,
always exists as a possibility for a scientific theory. But given that
Soar is a reasonable model of human cognition, then there is a clear
indication of exactly how to go forward in detail. The bridging rules
for Soar as a unified theory of cognition are set. They make clear
how to use Soar as a theory and how to bring specific experimental
data to bear on Soar to assess how good a theory it is.

4.8. Soar and the Shape of Human Cognition

Pursuing in detail the consequences of this mapping starts in ear-
nest with the next chapter, on immediate responses. Before starting
that enterprise, let’s step back and take a more global view. Does
Soar have the general shape of human cognition? Are its global
features, as revealed in this chapter, of the right kind? Contrari-
wise, does it present some caricature of a human? Or is it simply
wide of the mark in some respect? A unified theory of cognition
must be a good theory in the large as well as in the small.

Figure 4-24 gives a sample of the qualitative global characteristics
of Soar and human cognition. Unfortunately, no hard data are avail-
able upon which to base such a listing. | know of no good existing
lists of characteristics that can be taken as a useful standard, though
certainly a massive amount of writing, observation, and folk psy-
chology bears on the general character of human nature. Indeed,
these are the kind of phenomena where Everyman is king and the
servants count equal to the nobility. It would be extremely useful if
there were lists of this sort to provide some objectivity and disci-
pline to global comparisons. Then, at least, the same questions
about qualitative features could be asked of all candidates for uni-
fied theories of cognition. And those attempting to address the list
would not have to be its creators.

In any event, Figure 4-24 is one list. The convenient idiom is to
talk about Soar having such and such properties, as if it were a
modal human. This is shorthand for circumlocutions that say that
the unified theory of cognition, of which Soar is an operational
