Immediate Behavior # 255

son is well prepared, so the task is simple, understandable, and
explainable, and ample opportunity is given for the person to under-
stand and practice all relevant aspects of the task. Third, the task
environment is well behaved, so care is taken that untoward things
do not happen and the situation is not open ended and uncertain.
Often, of course, the experimental design deliberately includes ele-
ments of uncertainty and surprise, but these are limited to specific
task dimensions and inserted in highly controlled ways. The net
result of all these constraints and enforcements is a specific central
paradigm for immediate-response tasks: the presentation of a
stimulus in a familiar class, to which the person generates an im-
mediate (speeded) response in a familiar class, according to a sim-
ple rule or correspondence that the person has become skilled in
using. This central paradigm can be elaborated in many ways—a
preparatory phase, a sequence of two presentations, an occasional
surprise. But the boundaries of the paradigm are exceeded when
the person begins to be error prone, puzzled, surprised, forgetful,
or unmotivated. {n all these cases, task duration also tends to ex-
ceed ~~I sec.

To explore how these task conditions specialize Soar, we first lay
out the problem space in which immediate behavior takes place.
This is the space where perception and motor behavior interface
with cognition. Hence, this discussion augments the brief treatment
of the total cognitive system given in Chapter 4. Next we specify
the functions that the operations in this space must perform to do
the task, abstracting away from some of the details of their full
operation. Finally, we specify the basic temporal parameters re-
quired to obtain numerical predictions of response time. The result
of this section will be an abstract analysis scheme that can then be
applied to several examples.

5.3.1. The Base-Level Problem Space (BLS)

Like all other behavior, immediate response occurs in a problem
space. This is the space in which the working-memory elements
created by perception (via encoding perhaps) become available for
cognitive consideration; and in which the commands are issued that
result (via decoding perhaps) in the motor system taking action.
Both input and output occur in a single space, since otherwise
taking an impasse would also be required for taking an action, and
this would imply some permanent lack of knowledge. This space is
