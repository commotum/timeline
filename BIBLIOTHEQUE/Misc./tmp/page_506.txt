knowledge-level analysis; it has no theoretical apparatus to deal
with the symbol level, where most real games are won or lost.
{G]. Soar, as we have been considering it, has a single deliberate
goal, which can be taken as an operator in the base-level space.
This is T, the tasking operator, in the scheme of Chapter 5, although
that chapter focused on immediate behavior. This top task gets
expanded out into an indefinite goal stack because of the difficulties
that are encountered, so there are multiple goals. But this goal
hierarchy is entirely devoted to a single outcome (the top task, 7).
It is characteristic of social situations that there are multiple, some-
what independent goals around at all times. This multiple-goal situ-
ation may be an essential feature of a social situation. Moreover, it
may not be the multiple-goal character per se that counts but the
specific content of these goals. There are (at least) three of them.
Each individual cares about the task the group is performing. The
individual also cares about maintaining the social situation of the
group. Finally, each individual cares about his or her own Position
in the group and the personal satisfactions to be obtained from
membership in the group. These three goals interact in characteris-
tic ways. It may be that we do not have social agents in social
