                     Zhouetal. [2023] “randomly sample consecutive index hints from a pre-defined ordered set of hints
                     with 102 symbols,” for example a6b7c5 + a1b6c3 = a7b3c9. We implement this method two ways.
                     Firstly, cyclic, here we treat the list as cyclic when sampling. Secondly, non-cyclic, this reduces the
                     numberofsampleswhichreceivethe embeddings later in the ordering as we only sample from the
                     list in order. We see similar results for models trained on up to twenty digits as Zhou et al. [2023].
                     Wedonotethatourformat of taking the mean exact match accuracy does highlight robustness as
                     if one of the three models tested were to not generalize well, this would impact reported accuracy
                     heavily. We only show a comparison to size 20 training data due to the increased cost of evaluating
                     these index hint models, as the inputs and outputs are approximately double the length of regular
                     questions the inference time is heavily increased. Due to the robustness issues highlighted by Zhou
