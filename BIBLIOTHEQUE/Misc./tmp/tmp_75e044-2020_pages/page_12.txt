           Table 4. An example where REALM adapts to the updated knowledge corpus. The Wikipedia page “Excellent Cadaver” was added in
           2019, so the model was not about to recover the word when the knowledge corpus is outdated (2018). Interestingly, the same REALM
           model pre-trained on the 2018 corpus is able to retrieve the document in the updated corpus (2020) and generate the correct token,
           “Lawrence”.

           Figure 4. The Retrieval Utility (RU, described in Eq. 2) vs the number of pre-training steps. RU roughly estimates the “usefulness” of
           retrieval. RU is impacted by the choice of masking and the number of pre-training steps.
