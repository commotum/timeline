edge in the long-term memory. But it must include some prefer-
ences that make the decision occasion that produced the impasse
now yield a clear choice. This does not require any formulation of
the set of possibilities for what could resolve the impasse. The
decision procedure itself determines that. Nor does it require any
specific reconsideration of the decision situation. At every decision
cycle all choices are open to be made and are considered in the
context of whatever alternative choices have been proposed. Pref-
erences can be produced at any time that make a choice at the site
of the earlier impasse. Then that choice will simply be taken and the
processing will move on from there. Alternatively, preferences
could be produced that make a choice somewhere higher up in the
context stack, in effect abandoning all the lower processing. All the
processing in the subgoal and subgoals generated by the higher
impasse will become moot and can just be aborted.

We can now complete the picture of the decision cycle. Figure
4-8, which is the same as Figure 4-5 except for the addition of the
impasse mechanism, shows where the goal stack comes from. With
each impasse a new subgoal context is created, which has a goal but
no problem space, state, or operator. Contexts are removed from
the context stack when a decision changes something higher in the
