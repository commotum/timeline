1.2. What Are Unified Theories of Cognition?

Having indicated what I mean by a theory, let me now say what I
mean by a unified theory of cognition, the theme of this book. I
mean a single set of mechanisms for all of cognitive behavior. What
should that cover? Figure 1-5 presents a list.

Problem solving, decision making, and routine action? These are
at the center of cognitive behavior. Memory, learning, and skill?
These equally belong at the center. Skill might not have been so
obvious a decade ago, but since then the study of cognitive skill on
the one hand and automatic behavior on the other now makes its
inclusion obvious.

Perception and motor behavior? Matters now get interesting, be-
cause they are often excluded. Indeed, the term cognition emerged
in part to indicate the central processes that were ignored by pe-
ripheral perception and motor behavior. Yet one problem with psy-
chology’s attempt at cognitive theory has been our persistence in
thinking about cognition without bringing in perceptual and motor
processes. Given all that we now understand about human informa-
tion processing, and especially how it must have evolved from crea-
tures who had well-developed perceptual and motor capabilities,
the distinction is clearly one of analysis and not one of nature.
Perception and motor behavior must be included.

Language? Now matters get convoluted—at least for me. There
is no question that language should be included. Many people
would start with language, and not with problem solving, decision
making, and routine action, as I did. Even if one were to classify
language under perception and motor behavior—and an interesting
case can be made for that—these peripheral processes have been
