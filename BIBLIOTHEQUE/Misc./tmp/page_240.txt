Symbolic Processing for Intelligence = 227

1. Has the general features derived from the real-time constraint
+ Symbol system, automatic/controtled behavior, recognition-based,
fast-read/slow-write, continual shift to recognition (learns from
experience)
2. Behaves intelligently
+ Not completely rational (only approximates knowledge level)

3. Goal oriented
+ Not just because it has learned goals
+ Goats arise out of its interaction with environment

4, Interrupt driven
+ Depth-first focal behavior, progressive deepening

5. Default behavior is fundamentally adaptive
+ Does not have to be programmed to behave

6. Serial in the midst of paralletism
+ Autonomous behavior (hence an unconscious)

7, Recognition is strongly associative
+ Does not have deliberate access to all that it knows
+ Remembering can be a problem, but can be taken as a task

8. Doesn’t know how it does things
+ Learned procedures are nonarticulable; chunking accesses
working-memory trace, not productions
+ Can work interpretively from deciarative procedures

9. There is meta-awareness or reflection
+» Can step back and examine what it is daing
10, Uses indefinitely large body of knowledge
11. Aware of large amounts of immediate detail
« But focused, with a penumbra
12. Distractible

embodiment, describes (or predicts) humans as having the proper-
ties in question.

To see the importance of such a list, we start with distractibility.
It is the last item (12), but it provides a specific lesson. In the early
1960s, Walt Reitman (1965) developed an entire research path in
reaction to the single-mindedness of GPS, an early simulation of
human problem solving (Newell & Simon, 1963). GPS seemed to
have none of the distractibility so characteristic of human behavior
(as we can all testify, with tittle need of hard data). Reitman thought
