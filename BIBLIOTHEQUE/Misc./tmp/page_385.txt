Intendedly Rational Behavior # 373

column, 0 + £ = O, although it involves other columns as well. It
is apparent from the total problem-behavior graph that S3 has a dif-
ficult time with this column. He continues to work on it from lines 9
through 29, about 10 minutes, and then again from lines 35 through
46, another approximately 7 minutes. The source of difficulty is
clear enough. In O + E = O, the value of O does not make any
difference (or, if the column is thought of as a constraint equation,
then the O's cancel out). In fact, this just makes the value of £
depend on the carries in and out: cj, + E = 10¢,,,. But if the carries
are not always taken into account, it is easy to get confused and
uncertain. Thus, ignoring the carries entirely leads to the conclu-
sion that £ = 0, which conflicts with the fact that T = 0 is already
solidly concluded. If the conclusion were based on explicitly posit-
ing that cj, = 0 and co, = 0, then it would be easy to consider
changing one or the other to ¢ = 1, but if the carries have been
ignored, there seems to be no place to go. In any event, this is the
mire S3 is in.

Thus, we have a good example of what a person does when he is
puzzled and confused and is trying to reason out something at the
limits of his ability. Figure 7-5 gives the protocol data for this pe-
riod. There are clear indications that $3 is indeed uncertain of the
situation (B62-65 and B80-82). For us—for Soar as a unified the-
ory of cognition—the question is whether the control of such be-
havioral turbulence can be described. The problem-behavior graph
in Figure 7-4 is that of Soar and it is indistinguishable from that of
$3, given the limits of the protocol data to establish it. Over each
state box of Soar’s PBG are the B-numbers indicating the corre-
sponding part of the protocol.

Let us go through the segment. It starts at line LI, where $3 has
just assigned R to be 7 (through AV) and is focused on column 3,
The prehistory to this step is such that D> 5 and T = 0 witha carry
of 1 into column 2, but its details can be safely ignored. S3 then
processes (PC) column 3, getting that L equals 3, and follows this
by testing (TD) the assignment. This sequence is tightly coupled.
The search control first says, if a new result occurs (R -> 7) then see
where it leads (to PC on column 3 and L = 3). Then it says, if there
is a new value for a letter (ZL = 3), then check if it is okay (7D on
L = 3). This sequence of PC followed by TD occurs repeatedly
throughout the protocol by the application of these two bits of
search-control knowledge. The result of TD is unclear (?). From the
