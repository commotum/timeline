of the rules. This starts at 23 percent for the youngest group (5- 6
years) and diminishes to 0 percent for the oldest group (16~17
years). The small size of these residuals is the evidence that behav-
ior is highly regular. As might be expected, regularity increases
with age. It can be seen from the table that the youngest children
use only the simplest rule and then, as age increases, the fractions
of the more complex and adequate rules continually grow. Even
with the oldest children, however, only a small fraction (17 percent)
are using the fully adequate torque rule, Even most adults don't
compare torques.

These data provide a particularly impressive example of the stage
analysis provided by information-processing developmental psy-
chology. These rules fit within a simple process model, so that
simple simulations predict just how the bulk of the children behave.
The rules themselves are clearly ordered from simple to complex.
Indeed, they form a hierarchical tree of tests, such that each suc-
cessive model has all the capabilities of the prior ones. Thus, we see
clearly in evidence the comparative-statics analysis. Everything
seems to be here—except how the children move from stage to
stage.

There are two other important facts about the balance-beam situ-
ation (derived and supported from this and other related experi-
ments by several investigators). First, there is a fair amount of
evidence that encoding is important, namely, what children decide
to encode in the situation and thus attend to. The rules are based on
what information is actually attended to in the task, not on what we
know the child must know in general. All the children know about
distance and use this knowledge in various ways throughout their
daily life. They do not all use it to encode the balance beam, how-
ever, and so it is not in fact available in the situation.

Second, children can be trained on this task to behave according
to more advanced rules than they use of their own accord. Further-
more, they can actually move up some levels in the developmental
sequence by such training, in that advanced behavior attained
through training seems to be a relatively permanent acquisition.
This is a result that has emerged in the last ten to fifteen years.
Piaget himself believed that the stages of development were pretty
much fixed. Children could not advance beyond their cognitive
station, so to speak. Early experiments seemed to confirm that
children could not be moved ahead in the developmental sequence.
