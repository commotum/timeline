each of the operations. Perception (P) and motor behavior (M)
are primitives as far as our analysis is concerned, but encoding (£)}
and decoding (D) consist of sequences of production cycles, and the
others, A, C, and J, involve operators, which are composed of
decision cycles, which themselves are composed of production cy-
cles and the decision procedure. Independent productions will fire
in parallel during one cycle, of course, so that sequences of produc-
tions arise only with dependency.

For simple speeded tasks, most of the functions can be accom-
plished with a minimum operator that simply detects or reads some
code in the current state and records or writes some other code.
Even when the required processing is slightly more extended, the
steps will still be quite independent, with the result that the total
function will be a sequence of minimum operators. Thus, the time
for the minimum operator provides a basic time unit for the analy-
sis. The minimum operator requires one minimum decision cycle to
select the operator and one minimum decision cycle to apply the
operator. The minimum decision cycle is one production cycle and
one minimum operation of the decision procedure. This is true both
for selection (a single production enters an acceptable preference)
and application (a single production augments the state with a code
or sets a motor command), Thus, the minimal operator will take
2 x (production-cycle-time + decision-procedure-time).

Numerical values for the parameters are required if we are to
produce quantitative predictions of behavior. The usual practice in
psychological experimentation is to treat each experiment or ex-
perimental series as essentially an independent unit with respect to
quantitative predictions. The rationale has two parts. On the nega-
tive side, each experimental situation has many unique features, so
absolute parameters cannot be expected to apply across experi-
ments and laboratories. On the positive side, the purpose of an
experiment is to reveal some phenomenon or regularity, and the full
quantitative details are almost always irrelevant to this. Each im-
mediate-response experiment usually has a single estimated param-
eter that bundles together all the unique perceptual, motor, and
cognitive processes. These often show up as the intercept on some
plot, where the quantities of interest are the changes with condition
or sometimes the slopes. The experiments on automatic and con-
trolled behavior in Figure 3-8 provide a typical example.

Cognitive psychology does believe that cognitive mechanisms
