English version of production
Propose-operator*comprehend:
If the problem space is the base-level-space,
and the state has a box with nothing on top,
and the state has input that has not been examined,
then make the comprehend operator acceptable,
and note that the input has been examined.

problem-space element <p> must have the name base-level-space.
The third condition constrains the state <s> in two ways. First (the
fourth condition) <s> must be a block that is on the table and has a
clear top. Second (the fifth condition), it must have an unexamined
input. This latter is given as a negated condition (marked by —),
which is satisfied only if the condition itself is not satisfied by any
elements in the working memory. State sSt actually has several
