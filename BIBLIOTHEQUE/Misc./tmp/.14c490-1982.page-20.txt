Figure 18.10 Proportion of inferior temporal neurons that had bilateral (B), contralateral
(C), or ipsilateral (I) receptive fields after unilateral ablation of prestriate cortex (in black).
Data for part A were obtained from inferior temporal neurons contralateral to the lesion,
whereas data for part B were obtained from those ipsilateral to the lesion. Asterisks de-
note the receptive fields deviating from the prediction; that is, deviating from those
obtained after unilateral striate-cortex removals, shown in figure 18.2. Adapted from Un-
gerleider, Snyder, and Mishkin, in prep.

part A of figure 18.2, stimulation in the right hemifield will activate
about 90% of the inferior temporal neurons in the left hemisphere (all
those with either bilateral or contralateral visual fields) and about 70%
of the inferior temporal neurons in the right hemisphere (all those with
either bilateral or ipsilateral visual fields). By contrast, in the animals
with left prestriate removals, stimulation in the right hemifield acti-
vated about 25% of inferior temporal neurons. That is, as indicated in
figure 18.10, right-hemifield stimulation activated about 15% of the in-
ferior temporal neurons in the left hemisphere and about 35% in the
right. Thus, the massive prestriate removals did greatly reduce the vi-
sual input to inferior temporal neurons—in fact, by more than two-
thirds (80% to 25%)—thereby accounting for the severe deficit that
such lesions produced in pattern discrimination relearning. On the
other hand, the removals did not completely eliminate striate input to
inferior temporal neurons (25%, as compared with 0% after striate re-
movals), and this fact accounted for the ultimately successful retraining
by approximation that was achieved in the animals with such lesions.
Even with this electrophysiological evidence, the conclusion that be-
