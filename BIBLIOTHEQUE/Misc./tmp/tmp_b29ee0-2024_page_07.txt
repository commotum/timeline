                                              As shown in Fig. 3, Geometric Enhancer Module G is composed of three
                                         blocks, each featuring a KPConv [58] layer followed by BN and ReLU activation.
                                         Thearchitecture is similar to the 2D convolutional stem [16]. We utilize KPConv
                                         instead of vanilla convolution or linear layer here to facilitate grasping the local
                                         geometric information effectively. The resultant geometric feature, represented
                                         by gf ∈ RN×D, contains the features across all points, thereby supplementing
                                         the missing local information. This gf is then leveraged to infuse geometric

                                         explanation. To fine-tune the integration of geometric information, we introduce
                                         a learnable gating factor g that modulates the balance between the attention

                                         layer’s output and the input feature fi. This gating factor is initially set to zero,
                                         to ensure that the incorporation of geometric data does not abruptly alter f
                                         feature distribution. Such an approach allows for the preservation and effective
