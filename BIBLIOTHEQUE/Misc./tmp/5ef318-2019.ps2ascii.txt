                                                     Howtheneocortex works is a mystery. In this paper we propose a novel framework for
                                                     understanding its function. Grid cells are neurons in the entorhinal cortex that represent
                                                     the location of an animal in its environment. Recent evidence suggests that grid cell-
                                                     like neurons may also be present in the neocortex. We propose that grid cells exist
                                                     throughout the neocortex, in every region and in every cortical column. They deﬁne

                                                     to the object being touched and cortical columns in visual cortex track the location

                (rectangle). The locations of activation form a periodic grid-like lattice. The activation locations are always the same for any particular environment. (B) A grid cell
                module is a set of grid cells that activate at the same spacing and orientation but at different positions in the environment. The activation locations for two grid cells in
                a grid cell module are shown (red and blue dots). Every location in an environment will activate one or more grid cells in a module. Because of the periodic activation
                of grid cells, a single grid cell module cannot represent unique locations. (C) Multiple grid cell modules (two shown, top and bottom) tile the same space at different
                orientations and/or spacings. (D) Although a single module cannot represent unique locations in an environment, the activity across multiple modules can. This

                hippocampus learn the structure of environments. (A) Two rooms that a rodent has learned. Because of distinct landmarks (suggested by blue and green rectangles)
                an animal will perceive these as different rooms. Locations in a room are represented by the activity in a set of grid cell modules in the entorhinal cortex. Three
                locations are shown for each room (A,B,C and D,E,F). Representations of location are unique to both the location in a room and the room. Therefore, if an animal can
                determine it is in location A, then it knows what room it is in (Room1) and its location in the room. The locations associated with a room are united via movement and
                path integration. As an animal moves, the representation of location is updated (red arrows) based on an internal copy of its motor behavior. By exploring a room, the
                animal learns the features associated with locations in the room. (B) We propose that objects such as a pen or coffee cup are similarly deﬁned by a set of locations
                (four labeled for the pen and three labeled for the cup). Grid cells in the neocortex represent the location of a sensor patch (for example, tip of ﬁnger) in the location
                space of the object. Locations in an object’s space are unique to the object and the location relative to the object. An object’s space includes locations that can be

                two previously learned objects, “cup” and “logo.” The goal is to represent this relationship efﬁciently, without any relearning. (B) The cup and the logo each have their
                ownunique set of locations. Three locations are shown in cup space (a, b, c) and three locations are shown in logo space (x, y, z). When the logo is placed on the
                cup there is a ﬁxed one-to-one mapping between locations in cup space and locations in logo space. This relationship can be represented as a displacement vector
                between the two spaces (blue arrows). (C) Animals exploring an environment can determine the direction and distance from their current location, a, to a previously
                visited target location, b, even if they have never taken this path before. Determining the displacement between two locations in the same space (e.g., a to b in C) is
                equivalent to determining the displacement between two locations in separate spaces (e.g., a to x in B). (D) A method to determine the displacement between two
                locations. Each grid cell module is paired with a displacement cell module. Cells in a displacement cell module (blue dots) respond to a particular displacement
                between pairs of grid cells (green dots). Any two pairs of grid cells with the same displacement in physical space will activate the same displacement cell.
                Displacement cells cannot represent a unique displacement in the same way that grid cells cannot represent a unique location. However, the set of active cells in
                multiple displacement cell modules (three shown) will represent a unique displacement. Because the set of active grid cells in multiple grid cell modules is unique to
                objects (cup and logo), the set of active displacement cells will also be unique (to both the cup and logo). Thus, a set of active displacement cells can represent the

                changes, but how? For example, a stapler has several behaviors, one is rotating the top relative to the base. If the top of the stapler is a component object of the
                stapler, with its own location space, then its position relative to the stapler base is represented by a displacement vector as illustrated in Figure 3. (The top and base
                of the stapler are analogous to the logo and the cup. Unlike the logo on the cup, the location of the stapler top relative to the base can change.) The closed position
                is represented by displacement A and the fully open position is represented by displacement E. As the stapler top hinges from the closed to open position, the
                displacement vector will continually change. (Five positions, A to E, and corresponding displacement vectors are shown.) To learn this behavior, the neocortex only
                needs to learn the sequence of displacement vectors as the top rotates.
                FIGURE5|Locationprocessing in different areas of the brain. Grid cells and displacement cells (see text) can be applied to different tasks in different areas of the
                brain. (A) If grid cell modules in the hippocampal complex are anchored by cues in an environment, then grid cell activation patterns will represent locations relative
                to that environment. Given two locations, a and b, displacement cells will calculate the movement vector needed to move the body from point a to point b. (B) If
                cortical grid cell modules are anchored relative to the body, then they will represent locations in body space. Given two locations, displacement cells will calculate the
                movementvector needed to move a body part from its current location to a desired new location relative to the body. (C) If cortical grid cell modules are anchored by
                cues relative to an object, then they will represent locations in the object’s space. Displacement cells will calculate the movement vector needed to move a limb or
                sensory organ from its current location to a new location relative to the object. Operations performed in (B,C) are associated with “where” and “what” regions in the

                FIGURE6|Rethinking cortical hierarchy. (A) Commonly held view of cortical hierarchy. Sensory input is processed in a hierarchy of cortical regions. The ﬁrst region
                detects simple features. The next region combines simple features into more complex features. This is repeated until a region at the top of the hierarchy forms
                representations of complete objects. (B) Modiﬁed view of cortical hierarchy. Every column in every region learns complete models of objects. (Columns learn
                complete models by combining sensory input with an object-centric location of that input and integrating over movements of the sensor.). Shown are two sensory
                hierarchies, one for vision and one for touch, both sensing the same object, a cup. There are multiple models of an object within each region, in different regions
                within a sensory modality, and in different sensory modalities. Although there are many models of the same object (suggested by the small cup images), the models
                are not identical, as each model is learned via a different subset of the sensory arrays. The green arrows denote the numerically-large cortical-cortical connections
                that are not hierarchical in nature. The non-hierarchical connections project within the region of origin, across hierarchical levels, across modalities, and between
                hemispheres. Typically, many columns will be simultaneously observing the same object. The non-hierarchical connections between columns allow them to rapidly
                infer the correct object (see text). Although learning objects requires movement of the sensors, inference often occurs without movement due to the non-hierarchical
                connections.
              “level skipping” is the rule, not the exception. Therefore, V1              between regions in the left and right hemispheres (Clarke and
              and V2 are both, to some extent, operating on retinal input.                Zaidel, 1994), and there are numerous connections between

              recognized in both V1 and V2, and even larger letters may be                proposed that cell activity in some layers (e.g., L4 and L6) of a
