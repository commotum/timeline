plied. Its space (build-conclusion) puts together legal propositions.
The knowledge of the task, which is to produce what necessarily
follows between the two end terms, is in the form of search control
in this space. The task is decomposed into discovering the subject,
predicate, and quantifier of the conclusion—the components of the
conclusion. The task knowledge permits determining some parts
without other parts being specified. Incomplete or incorrect know!-
edge leads to composing conclusions that are invalid. (4) Generat-
ing the subject is tried first, which uses the prop-to-prop space
because the propositions, not the model, distinguish between sub-
jects and objects. (5) Attend-to-prop selects the first proposition
and copy-subject creates the subject of the conclusion (archers). (6)
Next, generate-predicate is selected; this occurs in the model-to-
prop space, because the propositions probably contain no useful
information about the predicate. (7) The attend-to-object operator
applies, but no others, because the model is incomplete. Use of this
operator leads to augmentation of the model in the prop-to-model
space. (8) Attend-to-prop selects premises to extract more informa-
tion, but neither premise yields anything. (9) The create-auxiliary
operator produces a new proposition in the prop-to-prop space. It
attends to the second premise and applies operators that convert it,
creating the new premise All bowlers are canoeists. (10) The new
premise allows solving in the prop-to-model space to resume, for
Soar now focuses attention on this new proposition and uses it to
augment the model. (11) The model now suggests a predicate, so
solving is able to continue in the model-to-prop space to obtain the
predicate for the conclusion (are canoeists). (12) All that remains to
be done in the build-conclusion space is to generate the quantifier.
The model does not contain the knowledge about quantifiers, since
this is what cannot be represented in a single situation model. So
the prop-to-prop space is used again. (13) Soar attends to the first
premise and copies its quantifier (some), finally obtaining Some
archers are canoeists. This is incorrect, but many humans fail this
syllogism as well. Getting a valid conclusion depends on appropri-
ate knowledge being available at many local choice points, as Soar
shuttles back and forth inspecting the situation model and the prem-
ISES.

We now have a Soar system for doing sy!logisms that reflects
directly the constraints of the syllogism task, the use of annotated
models, the Soar architecture, and the heuristic knowledge that
