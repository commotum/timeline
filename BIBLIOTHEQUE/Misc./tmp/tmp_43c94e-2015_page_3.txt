                      I wonder how the article begins,with a few chars randomly?

                      On Mac OS I keep getting: "luajit: not enough memory" every time i try to use more than 200 neurons on 3
                      layers. I have 16gb onboard and basically it's all free. Do you have any idea how to allow luajit to use more
                      memory? I tried with "WITH_LUA_JIT=0 luarocks install torch" but no luck at all. Thanks

                                  Luajit can only use 1 GB of memory (or I think up to 4 if it's 32 bit.)

                                              Thank you to begin with.
                                              Is there any way to use the project without relying on Luajit in order to use more than 1Gb?

                                                           Well that limit is only for objects inside of Lua itself. Lua can connect to C and C++
                                                           code, and use functions and data in them without adding to the memory limit. This
                                                           is what Torch does, which is the NN library being used here. You should be able to
                                                           have arbitrarily huge networks in Torch without reaching this limit.
                                                           So it really shouldn't require this much memory, and my best guess is it's a bug or
                                                           inewciency somewhere in the code.

                      Amazing work!
                      It seems though that the quality of the output correlates with how well you can give feedback to the RNN.
                      Although you haven't mentioned how, I'm assuming that correct words in the output would imply positive
                      feedback. So after many iterations you see correct words, because the weights may be stabilizing for lack of
                      any negative feedback. If you were able to give feedback based on sentence structure, grammatical rules and
                      perhaps even an ontological representations of the words, it could produce even more meaningful output.

                      Holy shit! This is amazing. So many things I want to try this with, but I don't know how yet :(
                      I tried making rnnlm do per-character things. I just did it via preprocessing and feeding the rnnlm tool different
                      sorts of input. I didn't get anywhere near the kind of performance you're getting - it was pretty unreliable at
                      actually generating english words, but further training didn't seem to be helping. It was pretty fun, though, and
                      the non-words it generated still sounded like words. :D
