Figure 4-15. The total cognitive system: perception,
cognition, and the motor system.

(located across the bottom of Figure 4-15). Much of the design of
the total system is driven by requirements of this controller task.
There must be some processes that transduce the energies in the
environment into signals for the system. These are collectively
called perceptual systems (P), although they are tied down only on
the sensory side (transduction from the environment). Similarly,
there must be some processes that affect the environment, inject-
ing, so to speak, the organism's energies into it. These are the
motor systems (M), although they are tied down only on the physi-
cal-action side. Because the environment is a dynamic system, pro-
ducing a stream of unpredictable events, there must be a buffer
memory, so that the cognitive system can get some temporal room
for its own processing. This is the working memory—the same
memory into which central cognition (C} works. Thus, the working
memory becomes the communication device for all the components
of the total system. It is a bus as well as a buffer.

This arrangement of working memory as bus and buffer is the
simplest structural assumption, given the apparatus already in place
for central cognition. However, this assumption is worth examin-
ing. The functional imperatives are that buffering must occur and
