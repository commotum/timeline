of comparison, and then ceases to do so, then the agent dumps on
the other person. That does not follow from any obvious rational
considerations, even in the multiagent situation, and it is clearly
emotional behavior, so it is labeled [E].

The interesting conclusion from this brief analysis is that, to get
some theoretical action in the domain of social comparison, Festin-
ger had to provide an entire structure that was mostly nonsocial. He
had to spend most of his theoretical degrees of freedom building up
the basic apparatus of choice behavior. The elements of a social
situation that were necessary were primarily the existence of other
social actors, not any strong assumptions about the contents of
their beliefs. Many of the inferences of SCT do not follow from
strongly social aspects. Mostly, they follow just from the objective
character of the task environment, such as the reliability of decision
criteria, and the mere extension to the existence of other rational
agents. Possibly, with a general cognitive theory, such as Soar,
more substantial progress can occur in the enterprise of which SCT
is one part. Maybe an appropriate theory of the individual agent at
the cognitive level—and not just at the knowledge level, which is
what game theory and its psychological derivative, decision theory,
basically provide—can provide the common ground for all such
efforts. The pattern of pervasive limits to rationality revealed by
behavioral decision theory already indicates some of the ingre-
dients that need to be included (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky,
1982; Pitz & Sachs, 1984), though it does not integrate these results
into a unified architecture.

8.5. The Role of Applications

Applications are an important part of the frontier of any theory.
They are not quite the same as the scientific frontier, at least not in
the usual way of describing the scientific enterprise, but they are
equally diverse in character. Furthermore, the commerce across an
application frontier goes in both directions, not just from the sci-
ence to the application.

The first important point about applications was already touched
on in Chapter I. A unified theory of cognition is the key to success-
ful applied cognitive science. Real tasks engage many aspects of
cognition, not just a single aspect. Consequently, it is necessary for
an applied cognitive psychology to be able to treat all the aspects
