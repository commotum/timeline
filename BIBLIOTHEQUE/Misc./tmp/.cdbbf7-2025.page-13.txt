       Figure 6. Visualization of sparse features for several scenes. Blue points denote eliminated features by our feature elimination scheme,
       which is redundant for 3D object detection.
       Figure 7. Qualitative visualization of CMT [39] and our SparseVoxFormer-L. A blue box denotes a prediction with a confidence score
       greater than 0.3, while a green box indicates a ground-truth bounding box. A red arrow highlights a noticeable difference in predictions
       between CMTandourSparseVoxFormer.
