seen by reflecting on the conflict resolution scheme of OpsS, which
Soar abandoned. The Ops5 conflict resolution is a fixed mechanism,
which always controls what productions to fire, which has only
fixed knowledge (prefer a production that instantiates more recent
elements, prefer a production that is a special case of another}, and
from which there is no recourse if its knowledge is inadequate. But
its knowledge is only heuristic and thus when it fails (as it must in
some situations) Soar cannot possibly operate like a knowledge-
level system, even if the knowledge is encoded elsewhere in the
system. Soar abandons the fixed conflict-resolution mechanism and
thus keeps itself free to move toward a closer approximation to the
knowledge level. It does not, of course, abandon conflict resolu-
tion. The decision structure of Soar is the conflict-resolution mech-
anism. The impasses are the conflicts and setting up the subgoal
initiates the process of conflict resolution. Setting subgoals is not
like evoking a fixed mechanism, because all of Soar’s knowledge
and problem solving can be brought to bear to resolve a conflict.
This discussion reveals a major criterion for attaining a knowi-
edge-level system: no trap-state mechanisms are allowed. Anytime
a system has a mechanism that is both local (contained within a
small region of the system) and whose result must be accepted, then
a fixed gap has been created between the system and the knowledge
level. For the mechanism itself can (by assumption) only be a
source of a finite amount of knowledge; and when that knowledge
fails (as it must, if the tasks are diverse enough) there is no recourse
{also by assumption). Thus the system is trapped in its state of
knowledge, even if the knowledge exists elsewhere in the system.
Our example was the fixed conflict resolution, but there are many
others, such as fixed Lisp functions to perform operator selection
or to determine the order in which operators are to be applied.
Within the decision process, productions are allowed to run to
quiescence, as opposed to taking only a single cycle or terminating
after a fixed number of cycles. This design feature is clearly a
response to obtaining all the information that is immediately avail-
able. Impasses are a device for preventing the system from operat-
ing short of its full knowledge. They are the device that detects that
the immediately available knowledge is not sufficient and thus
keeps the system open to attempts to extract other knowledge
available through symbolic manipulations (that is through delibera-
tion). They keep the production system itself from being a trap-
