Figure !-4 gave a fragment of the problem-behavior graph of a
subject working in chess, taken from Human Problem Solving.
According to Figure 3-!1, it took a few seconds to make these
moves. These are not moves in the actual game, but moves in the
head, which the person is mentioning by talking aloud as he decides
ona move. They form an internal search of the space of moves and
countermoves. The accuracy of the representation is verified for
the most part by internal cross constraints—if the person had been
aware of features not stated, then he would never have searched in
the ways observed, nor commented about the position as he in fact
did. All that we want to observe about this search is how the times
stack up. The moves are at the ~~10 sec level. These moves are
indeed composed for this particular task, Almost always, the per-
son diagnoses the situation to conclude the function that a move
should perform—it should defend, attack, pin, move away, or
whatever. This is followed by the generation of the actual move,
which involves finding what moves in the particular position satisfy
the function and then making the move on the board (though of
course all in the person's mind).

These subtasks—diagnose the position, generate a move, and
make the move—are all practiced tasks for a good chess player.

Bach .by-themselneay take ~~1 sec, for they are not unitary acts

but are themselves composite. Making a move requires removing
the piece from its current square and placing it on a destination
square, meanwhile adjusting whatever representation is held in the
head (which is where this is going on) to take account of new
relationships. Identifying the moves that provide a function (de-
fend, for example) requires considering a nonhomogeneous set of
Possibilities—moving away, adding a defender, interposing against
an attacker. And diagnosing the situation initially requires the con-
sideration of a multitude of relations on the Chess board. Many of
these relations and their interrelations have been attended to and
analyzed on prior positions, but the immediately prior move will
have opened up some new considerations. Thus each act can be
seen to take ~~I sec and be itself composed of a set of acts. The
microacts now appear as acts of observing a relationship and decid-
ing to attend to it, or identifying the square to which to move the
piece. They could be ~~100 ms in duration, None of this is pinned
down carefully—we are not Proposing the details of how people
play chess. Rather, we are asking whether the amount of processing
involved in solving problems seems plausibly commensurate with
