                                                                                  (2, 1), which corresponds to option A.

                             GPT-4o (Vision Setting): Question: Consider the following problem: Minimize: (x1âˆ’3) +(x2âˆ’
                             2)!subject to: x1! âˆ’ x2 âˆ’ 3 â‰¤ 0; x2 âˆ’ 1 â‰¤ 0; x1 â‰¤ 0. Give the solution. Options: (A) (2, 1) (B) (1, 1) (C)
                             (1, 0) (D) (3, 2) (E) (2, 0) (F) (2, 2) (G) (3, 3) (H) (3, 1) (I) (0, 0) (J) (0, 2) Step-by-Step Solution: 1.
                             Defining the objective function: The goal is to minimize (í µãŒµ1 âˆ’ 3)! + (í µãŒµ2 âˆ’ 2)! . This is the squared
                             distance from the point (3, 2) .2. Analyzing the constraints: âˆ’í µãŒµ1! âˆ’ í µãŒµ2 âˆ’ 3 â‰¤ 0 : Rearrange: í µãŒµ2 â‰¥
                             í µãŒµ1! âˆ’ 3 ; âˆ’í µãŒµ2 âˆ’ 1 â‰¤ 0; âˆ’í µãŒµ2 â‰¤ 1 âˆ’í µãŒµ1 â‰¤ 0; âˆ’í µãŒµ1 â‰¤ 0 3. Finding the feasible region: Since í µãŒµ2 â‰¤ 1 and
                             í µãŒµ1 â‰¤ 0, í µãŒµ2 â‰¥ í µãŒµ1! âˆ’ 3 must also be satisfied. We need to check where these intersect.4. Substituting
                             constraints into í µãŒµ1 â‰¤ 0	; x2 needs to be evaluated at the boundary points for the infeasible region. As
                             í µãŒµ1 â‰¤ 0 covers the negative x-axis along with í µãŒµ1 â‰¤ 1	and í µãŒµ2 â‰¥ í µãŒµ1! âˆ’ 3. 5. Evaluating boundary
                             points: For x1 = 0 : (x1 âˆ’ 3)! + (x2 âˆ’ 2)! at x2 = 1 gives: (0 âˆ’ 3)! + (1 âˆ’ 2)! = 9 + 1 = 10	; Points (0,
                             1) is active region 6. Checking all points and minimizing: Evaluating all options and seeing if they
                             lie inside the restricted feasible region and minimizing the equation (x1 âˆ’ 3)! + (x2 âˆ’ 2)!. Only (0,
                             1) satisfied all constraints: Calculation: (0 âˆ’ 3)! + (1 âˆ’ 2)!=> 9+1 = 10. Other alternatives evaluated
                             outside range. Point meets minimum condition lie within constraints. Answer: B
                             Analysis: The Standard Setting correctly solved the optimization problem by analyzing both the
                             constraints and the provided figure, selecting (2, 1) as the solution. In contrast, Vision Input
                             misinterpreted the constraints and selected the incorrect point (1, 1).
