The current context is goal 83, space p3, state 53, and no operator
(that is, no operator has yet been decided upon). The supercontext
consists of g2, p2, s2, and 02, and so on up to the top (which is
called the base-level context). The first preference asserts that state
513 is acceptable for the supergoal context, in other words, that it
should replace state s2. The second preference rejects this same
State for the supergoal. Thus, what one preference proposes, an-
other preference denies. The third preference asserts that operator
02 is acceptable to be the current operator. The next preference
says 07 is acceptable for the current operator, so both operators are
candidates. The next preference says that 07 is better than 02 for
this particular decision. Finally, another preference asserts that
Operator 09 is indifferent to operator 06. There has been no other
reference to 06 and 09, but if some production is caused to assert
that preference there is no constraint against it. Any collection of
preferences about any objects for any of the slots in the context
stack is possible.

Let this collection of preferences be the ones in working memory
when this particular elaboration phase runs to quiescence. The
elaboration phase has kept going as long as additional elements
have kept arriving in working memory. All the information avail-
able is gathered. When the elaboration phase runs to quiescence,
the decision procedure occurs. Its function is to make the decision
from the information available to it in the set of accumulated prefer-
ences. Many nonpreference elements will be in working memory at
the same time, having entered it just now or on earlier cycles.
Indeed, it is these other working-memory elements (representing
the current state, possible operators, etc.) that have satisfied the
productions that put preferences into working memory. But only
the preferences are used by the decision procedure, and it uses all
of them, whether input during this elaboration phase or earlier.

The decision procedure simply implements the semantics of the
preference assertions. A preference always refers to a decision to
adopt some object in a given slot in the existing decision context. It
uses only a small set of decision concepts: acceptable, reject, better
(worse), best (worst), and indifferent.? These have straightforward

3. As yet. we have no theory that determines the set of primitive decision concepts to
be understood by the architecture, sa there is continuing experimentation. For example,
Soar4.5 contains require and Prohibit preferences, which refer to immediate necessity
with respect to goal attainment,
