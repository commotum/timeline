                Table 8 4DOccupancyForecastingPerformance. We compare the performance of OccWorld [48] and our proposed
                DynamicCity framework on Occ3D-nuScenes [40].

                Table9 UserStudyResults. We conduct user study comparing OccSora [41] and DynamicCity. The rating is of scale 1-5,
                the higher the better.

                8.4 ModelStats
                Wecompare the training speed, inference speed, training VRAM, and inference VRAM of OccSora [41] and
                DynamicCity. The results are presented in Tab. 10, Tab. 11, Tab. 12, and Tab. 13. While some of our models
                may be slightly slower and consume more memory compared to OccSora, they achieve significantly better
                performance. We also compare the total model size of OccSora and our model in Tab. 14. Our model is
                significantly smaller than OccSora while achieving superior performance.
                Table10 VAEModelStatisticsonCarlaSCDataset[42]. We compare the training time, inference time, training VRAM,
                inference VRAM of OccSora [41] and our DynamicCity.

                8.5 ComparisonswithSemCity
                Wecompare the generation quality of SemCity [17] and our DynamicCity in Tab. 15. Despite using a more
                compact latent representation and generating dynamic scenes, our model outperforms SemCity on most
                metrics.
