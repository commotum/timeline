some knowledge is acquired from some part distal to it, the content
of that knowledge is not known. If it were, then the knowledge
would have been already acquired. Thus, the acquisition of some
knowledge may lead to the acquisition of more. It cannot be known
in advance what the knowledge is that will be brought in. That is
exactly the point of the local/distal distinction—that the knowledge
that is encoded in neural structure at distal places cannot all be
encoded locally. There may not be very many trips to the well, so to
speak, but there can be no assurance that there will be only one.
Take it to be some small number.

As the figure shows, more processing is required than just the
multiple acts of deliberation, in which the knowledge is assembled
and actually brought to bear. There must also be an act of decision
and, after that, the selected operation must be performed. After all,
the function of the elementary deliberation is to take some action or
other. Each of these basic steps could take only of the order of
~~I0 ms, which means that it is possible they could be accom-
plished by minimal neural circuits. But they are all functionally
serial, The operation cannot be executed before the decision is
made to do so—else there has been no decision. The decision to do
so cannot be made until the knowledge is brought to bear-—else
there has been no deliberation. And later stages of deliberation
cannot occur until the earlier ones are completed, because it is the
earlier ones that contain the knowledge that leads to the further
distal accesses. Thus, there is functional seriality in the elementary
deliberation. There may of course also be lots of parallel operation.
What the figure shows as a single access may pull knowledge from
throughout the entire system simultaneously. When it arrives, all of
the knowledge may be locally circulated and scrunched together
concurrently. The figure doesn’t indicate all that might happen. It
indicates the mininuen that must happen.
