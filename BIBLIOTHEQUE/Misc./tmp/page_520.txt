immediately fatal. Big investments demand that abandonment be a
deliberate business, done only when the preponderance of evidence
shows it must be done.

(6) Unified theories of cognition must be made easy to use and
easy to make inferences from. This becomes especially important
for theories of very wide scope and for theories that are, in impor-
tant ways, embedded in simulations. We have learned in computer
science the immense effort required to produce a successful pro-
gramming language or a new operating system or a new statistical
package. It requires much more than the lone investigator with the
good idea and the initial implementation—as many lone pro-
grammers have found out to their sorrow. It requires attention to
the user interface, to user documentation, to training workshops, to
system support. These tasks are especially important for building
up a community around a unified theory and have become a sig-
nificant component of the Soar community effort.

(7) Finally, I repeat the exhortation to acquire domains of appli-
cation, which can support and invigorate a theory intellectually.
Building application domains, by the way, creates a community
with a large investment in ease of use, and hence with a willingness
to expend the effort to create the tools to make it happen.

So we end where we began, but with understanding. <l

Psychology has arrived at the possibility of unified theories of cogni-
tion—theories that gain their power by positing a single system of
mechanisms that operate together to produce the full range of cog-
nition.

I do not say they are here. But they are within reach and we should
strive to attain them.
