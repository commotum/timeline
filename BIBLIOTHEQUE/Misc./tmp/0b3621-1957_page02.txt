PREFACE

The work described in this report was supported as a part of
the internal research program of the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc.
The concepts discussed had their origins in some independent research by
the author in the field of physiological psychology, in which the aim has
been to formulate a brain analogue useful in analysis. This area of
research has been of active interest to the author for five or six years.
The perceptron concept is a recent product of this research programs
the current effort is aimed at establishing the technical and economic

feasibility of the perceptron.
