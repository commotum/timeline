                              As seen in Table 1, ArcMemo-PS achieves the best official score with standard compute 2 and
                              still benefits from additional scaling in both parallel samples and sequential retries. Table 4 shows
                              complete details on all settings at all scales, where ArcMemo-PS is the only setting that consistently
                              outperforms the baseline in all inference compute scales. Other memory formulations (Cheatsheet,
                              ArcMemo-OE)situationally improve over the baseline but still underperform it in some regimes.
                              Weobservethat ArcMemo-PS’sadvantage is most prominent with lower compute regimes. This is
                              consistent with the stated goal “memory for reasoning”: persisting previous experience aims to reduce
                              redundancy from rediscovering ideas found in previous rollouts. The marginal impact of memory is
                              reduced with more inference compute as the model can rediscover ideas through exploration.
                              Compared to our memory baseline (Cheatsheet), ArcMemo methods are highly competitive, per-
                              forming favorably in most regimes. The quantitative improvement shown by ArcMemo is supported
                              by qualitative analysis that demonstrates ArcMemo memories are more modular. This qualitative
                              analysis (described more in subsection 5.2) observes that these abstract memories improve concept
                              coverage–more target puzzle ideas are reflected in memory. This difference may be explained by
