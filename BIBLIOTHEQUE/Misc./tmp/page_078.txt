scheme to compose the transformations, which requires its own
medium, hence yet another level of transformations, and so on. But
this regress stops immediately when the same medium is used for
the transformations as for the Tepresentations. Then, it is all one
medium and so there is self-application. This is a situation we are all
familiar with in standard Programming languages, and we know
there are no fundamental difficulties. Again, problems of concep-
tion that would have been substantial fifty years ago are now of
no moment because of the computerized world we live in, which
makes familiar all these ideas and their basic consequences.

2.4. Machines and Computation

We have found our way to computational systems, via the back
door, by focusing on the Properties needed for representation.
Computational systems turn out to be exactly those systems that
provide composability of transformations. Let us begin the discus-
sion of the nature of computation with the notion of a machine,
which I have taken for granted so far. As often is true of general
terms, there isn't a standard definition, but the understanding is
common enough so that a suitable definition can be concocted for
our purposes. Start with a general notion of a system as a region of
the physical world that can be described by a set of interacting
variables, as shown in panel A at the top of Figure 2-8. If that
system is capable of input and Output, then we tend to call it a
machine. Thus, a machine is something that defines a function (in
the mathematical sense of a correspondence) from its input to its
output, and will produce its output when given its input. Given the
input, the output is determined.’ This is shown in panel B of the
figure. There is some kind of a medium that is processed, something
to be input and something to be output. This, of course, is a way of
describing systems—of imposing on them a descriptive viewpoint.
Thus when we talk about automobiles as machines, as we routinely
do, the media is physical space, the input is the occupants in one
location, and the output is the occupants in another location. We
don’t always look at systems as machines. The solar system cer-
tainly fits any reasonable definition of a system, but we don’t nor-

8. Sometimes the output is only probabilistically determined, but that comes to the
same thing for our purposes.
