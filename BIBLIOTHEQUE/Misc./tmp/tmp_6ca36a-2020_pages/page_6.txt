                 question length of the inference questions is the smallest because they are created from one triple. The

                 question and comparison question. The average answer lengths of comparison and bridge-comparison
                 questions are smaller than inference and compositional questions. This is because there are many yes/no
                 questions in the comparison questions.

                 Comparison questions require quantitative or logical comparisons between two entities to obtain the an-
                 swer. The system is required to understand the properties in the question (e.g., date of birth). Composi-
                 tional questions require the system to answerseveralprimitivequestionsandcombinethem. Forinstance,
                 to answer the question Why did the founder of Versus die?, the system must answer two sub-questions
                 sequentially: (1) Who is the founder of Versus? and (2) Why did he/she die?. Inference questions require
                 that the system understands several logical rules. For instance, to ﬁnd the grandchild, ﬁrst, it should ﬁnd
                 the child. Then, based on the child, continue to ﬁnd the child. Bridge-comparison questions require both
                 ﬁnding the bridge entity and doing a comparison to obtain the ﬁnal answer.
