                         of every triangle is empty, that is, there is no point from P in its interior. Exact O(nlogn) solutions
                         are available [16], where n is the number of points in P.
                         In this example, the outputs CP = {C1,...,Cm(P)} are the corresponding sequences representing
                         the triangulation of the point set P . Each Ci is a triple of integers from 1 to n corresponding to the
                         position of triangle vertices in P or the beginning/end of sequence tokens. See Figure 2 (b).
                         We note that any permutation of the sequence CP represents the same triangulation for P, addi-

                         generality, and similarly to what we did for convex hulls at training time, we order the triangles Ci
                         by their incenter coordinates (lexicographic order) and choose the increasing triangle representa-

                         Ptr-Net could better exploit is part of future work.
                         3.3  Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
                         TSP arises in many areas of theoretical computer science and is an important algorithm used for
                         microchip design or DNA sequencing. In our work we focused on the planar symmetric TSP: given
                         a list of cities, we wish to ﬁnd the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and
                         returns to the starting point. Additionally, we assume the distance between two cities is the same
                         in each opposite direction. This is an NP-hard problem which allows us to test the capabilities and
                         limitations of our model.
                         The input/output pairs (P,CP) have a similar format as in the Convex Hull problem described in
                         Section 3.1. P will be the cartesian coordinates representing the cities, which are chosen randomly
                         in the [0,1] × [0,1] square. CP = {C1,...,Cn} will be a permutation of integers from 1 to n
                         representing the optimal path (or tour). For consistency, in the training dataset, we always start in
                         the ﬁrst city without loss of generality.
                         To generate exact data, we implemented the Held-Karp algorithm [17] which ﬁnds the optimal
                                       n 2
                         solution in O(2 n ) (we used it up to n = 20). For larger n, producing exact solutions is extremely
                         costly, therefore we also considered algorithms that produce approximated solutions: A1 [18] and
                         A2[19], which are both O(n2), and A3 [20] which implements the O(n3) Christoﬁdes algorithm.
                         The latter algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd a solution within a factor of 1.5 from the optimal length.
                         Table 2 shows how they performed in our test sets.
