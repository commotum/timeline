Adequate preparation, warning, intensity, within fovea

Figure 5-7. The simplest response task (SRT).

Model Human Processor value for the motor processor cycle of 70
ms, with a range of 30-100 ms. This is within the range, but it seems
a little high if we consider the motor processor to be M + D, for this
assumption implies that M should be down toward the low end.

5.4. The Simplest Response Task (SRT)

At last, we are now prepared to deal with simple immediate-
response tasks. Figure 5-7 shows the simplest task: Press a button
when the light goes on. This is the minimum arc from stimulus to
response, asstiming (as we do) that there is adequate preparation,
including an immediately preceding warning, and that the stimutus
has adequate intensity and occurs within the fovea so no eye move-
ments are required. The figure provides an accounting of the pro-
cesses and how long they take, from which we obtain a prediction
of the time. Perception (P) is taken to be ~40 ms for a stimulus of
adequate intensity. For this simple response task, only detection is
required, not stimulus encoding, so 0 ms is required for E. Like-
