stimulus in task-dictated ways, selecting or constructing a re-
sponse, and composing and issuing commands to the motor system.
These could be packaged as two operators, C and J (as we have
done it) or as suboperators of a single Cf operator. Then, although
the boundary functions of verification at the beginning and com-
manding at the end are fixed, task encoding and response selection
or composition could intertwine in whatever way is most efficient.
On the other hand, a C/ operator might be composite and require an
impasse and subspace, so the decomposition into C and / each as
simple operators might be faster.

Even with a fixed functional decomposition, functions may re-
quire implementation by multiple productions and/or multiple
operators. The power of a production or a simple operator (an
operator realized within a single problem space) is dictated by the
Soar architecture and bears no necessary telationship to a general
function such as comprehension or intention. The architecture dic-
tates the boundary conditions: P and M are fixed; £ and D are
realized by collections of free-firing productions, and A is a single
Primitive operator. C and J are operators that can be as complex as
the task requires, but whose complexity remains limited by the
demands of the immediate-response task.

That functions can be realized in specific operators in multiple
ways is just the familiar point that there is more than one way to
skin a cat. Especially as the task to be performed (stimulus analysis
and response construction) becomes more complex, more alterna-
tive ways of carrying it out become possible. This is just the point
that psychologists must always be prepared for multiple methods
on the part of their subjects (Newell, 1973b; Siegler, 1987), Consid-
erations of efficiency weed out some methods, but there will still be
alternative plausible ways of accomplishing a task.

5.3.3. Making Quantitative Predictions

To make quantitative predictions of response time,® it is not enough
to write down the functions to be performed or even to specify the
way they map into operators. It is necessary to provide times for

$6, Errors are another type of quantitative prediction. However, error rates are ex-
tremely low in the class of immediate-response tasks under consideration, and de-
signedly so. Thus, the functional-operation abstraction does not retain the aspects of the
situation needed for an analysis of errors. Response time is the relevant quantitative
prediction.
