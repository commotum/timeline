about how to interpret the other parts of the utterance as well as
knowledge about the reference domain of the utterance. Given this
fact about language, given the decision for local operators, and
given the Soar architecture, then expectation data structures
follow.

For example, the word Ait (designating an action) expects a pre-
object (the hitter). This expectation is both about the semantics
(what kinds of things can be hitters) and about the linguistic forms
that can designate them (noun phrases). It expects knowledge about
them to be around already (which is why we called it a pre-object).
Likewise, Ait expects a post-object (the thing that was hit}, and
again this expectation comprises both semantic knowledge and lin-
guistic knowledge. Any other word, such as Jim, also has expecta-
tions, one of which can be the things that a Jim can do (to wit, hit),
Thus, expectations are not exclusively associated with verbs, al-
though, as the study of case grammars shows, fairly comprehensive
schemes can be built by associating all expectations with verbs.*

The Soar scheme seems extraordinarily simple. Nothing has been
added but the commitment to execute so-called comprehension
operators one after the other. Yet, there is a fair yield from this
simple assumption. First, we know from the Soar architecture and
how it attains general problem solving that this scheme is
indefinitely powerful (not all-powerful, only having no a priori fixed
limit). An operator (here, a comprehension operator) can lead to
problem spaces to implement it that can open up to any kind of
problem solving whatsoever. The results of such problem solving
can be brought back to bear on the difficulty (the impasse) that
evoked the problem solving. Thus, the simplicity in the compre-
hension-operator scheme does not lie in any limitation of activity,

4. A side note: This paragraph exhibits in clear form how the knowledge level actu-
ally gets used in practice. The paragraph says (repeatedly) that a word expects some-
thing, for example “hit expects a post-object.”’ This is short for saying that Soar expects
something when it encounters the word in an utterance, and that this expectation is
embodied in the comprehension operator of the word, which will thereby take appropri-
ate action on the basis of its knowledge, the appropriateness deriving from the goals of
Soar, via the occurrence of a nest of impasses. Thus, a symbol-level description of how
Soar understands language is made in terms of knowledge-level descriptions of symbel-
level mechanisms, which relate to the knowledge-level description of Soar, taken as a
given. Expectation is a knowledge-level term, since it does not refer to how the expecta-
tion is represented or the processes that operationalize it. Indeed, what is being spun out
here concems these symbol-level matters. With this semantic background, saying that
“hit expects a post-object” is a legitimate use of language.
