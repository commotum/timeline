the task is to prove that the proposition corresponding to P3, There
exists an x such that C(x) and not A(x), follows.

There are many variant (but equivalent) forms of the predicate
calculus that differ in their rules of inference, axioms, and style of
proof. We will follow Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas (1984), which
uses no axioms but embodies everything in rules of inference and
permits the use of additional derived rules. Its style is to make
assumptions, reason given these assumptions, and then remove the
assumptions. Thus, in Figure 7-9 a proof has a column for what is
being assumed and a column for what has been concluded, with a
further column at the right to indicate the rule of inference that
justifies the step. Let us simply talk our way through the proof, to
give some flavor of what is required,

(1) Premise P1 is introduced as a conclusion. (2) Any assumption
may be made, since what can be concluded will remain conditional
upon it. The ease of finding a proof depends, of course, on making
useful choices. This one is an instance of premise P1 with an arbi-
trary individual {a} from the domain of x. (3, 4) From an assumed
conjunction either of its parts can be concluded, so both parts are
brought over to the conclusion column. Their validity remains con-
ditional upon the assumption. (5) Now premise P2 is introduced.
(6) Universal quantification permits any instantiation to be con-
cluded. Thus P2 can be specialized to the individual a. (7) The rules
of inference only combine conclusions with identical assumptions.
Arbitrary assumptions can be added (though assumptions cannot
be arbitrarily dropped, of course). Thus the expression in step 6
is declared to be true with assumptions being used elsewhere.
(8) Now steps 3 and 7 can be combined by modus ponens (from A
and A 3 &, infer B) to get C(a). (9) Next, this conclusion can be
joined with step 4, since if two expressions are conclusions their
conjunction is as well. (10) Cfx) A + A(x) has been concluded in
step 8 for the specific individual a, hence it is possible to make the
weaker conclusion that there exists an x that makes C(x) A A(x)
true. (11) Inferencing has been proceeding under the assumption of
Ba) A AAfa}. It is now necessary to make the conclusion uncondi-
tional. The first step is to abstract the assumption away from the
specific variable a. If the conclusion holds under the assumption of
Bla) A -A(a), then it will hold under the assumption that there
exists an x that makes B(x) A + A(x) true (since such an x exists,
namely, a). This change of assumption is valid only if the conclu-
