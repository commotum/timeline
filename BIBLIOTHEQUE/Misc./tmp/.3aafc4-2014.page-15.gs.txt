                could be removed by adjusting the ﬂuctuating pixels. However, since each pixel can be adjusted
                                             2
                independently, there are 2n possible ways to adjust a given coarse-grained array.
                    Because we cannot search through this exponential number of possible adjustments to ﬁnd the
                optimal one, we develop an approximation algorithm to produce an adjustment that speciﬁcally
                targets pixels on the border between two thresholds.       Given the properties of the automaton—it
                begins with rows of dark cells on top, and light cells on the bottom—it is likely that each row of
                the coarse-grained array will contain similar values.    Thus, we adjust the coarse-grained array by
                using a majority algorithm. If a cell is within one threshold value of the majority value in its row,
                it is adjusted to the majority value.
                    The hope is that
                  (1) this adjustment will reduce artiﬁcial border complexity by “ﬂattening” ﬂuctuating border
                       rows to a single color,
                  (2) the adjustment will not eliminate actual complexity, since complicated structures will create
                                                                   15
