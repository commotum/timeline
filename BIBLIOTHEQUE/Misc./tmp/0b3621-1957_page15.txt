some members which will be inhibited when the "whole" is presented, The
sets of A-units activated by two different stimuli, selected at random,
will nonetheless tend to overlap; i.e.; they will contain some proportion

of common elements, P..

It is convenient to use the notation Asor to denote the
subset of A-units which is activated by Stimulus s and which transmits
impulses to Response Unit r. Thus Aa ok means the set of A=-units which
is activated by Stimulus Pattern 1, and which transmits impulses to
Response , Similarly, Ay 304,8,12 means the set of A-units which are
each activated by Stimulus Patterns 1 and 3, and each of which transmits
to the Response Units 4, 8 and 12. This will be a subset of AL ye and
will also be a subset of As As 93 etce. Thus, if we consider a system
with only two responses, and limit ourselves to two unrelated stimulus
patterns, chosen at random, each of which activates 50% of all A-units,

we would expect to find non-zero subsets in the following proportions:

Ala 25% of all A-units
Ana 25% of all A=units
Al 201 12.5%

Al 2 25%

Ayo 25%

Ay 2.2 12.5%

Aa, P 12.5%

Ay 4,2 12.5%

Ay 201,2 6.25% of all A-Units

In this system, the subsets Ay oe1 and AL 2.2 represents the units which
