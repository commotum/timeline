           At each step of the diffusion process, we apply noise to the input Hin and update the HexPlane using the
           following formula:
                                   H =m⊙H +(1−m)⊙Hin,                       (13)
                                    t     t         t
           where ⊙ denotes the element-wise product. This process inpaints the masked regions while preserving the
           unmasked areas of the scene, enabling partial scene modification, such as turning an empty street into one
           with heavy trafÏc.
           Outpaint. Outpainting extends the spatial dimensions of a given occupancy sequence. We use the same
           procedure for outpainting as we do for inpainting. Specifically, we mask half of the scene, shift the latent
           representation, and apply the inpainting process. Consequently, we could obtain a larger scene with consistent
           dynamics.
           Single frame occupancy. We apply the same procedure for single-frame occupancy conditional generation
           as for HexPlane conditional generation. Specifically, we preprocess the data, encode the first frame of each
           training sequence as a HexPlane, and fine-tune our HexPlane generation model for single-frame conditional
           generation.
