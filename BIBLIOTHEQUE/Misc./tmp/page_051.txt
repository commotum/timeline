38 s Unified Theories of Cognition

replace schemas with another construct. There is, of course, a ker-

nel of truth in what they say. Even so, the enterprise loses way.
Another risk is the Aalf-empty—half-full reaction, 1 keep saying,

“Look at how much this formulation explains,”’ and the echo keeps

: coming back, “‘Look at how much this formulation fails to ex-

plain.’ To one the glass is half full, to another the glass is half
empty. No matter how much one tries to show a unified theory and
our progress toward it, there will be huge domains in which
unification hasn’t made significant progress.

The final risk is the rising tide of connectionism, which is show-

: ing signs of sweeping over ail of cognitive science at the moment.

The excitement is palpable—we are all hot on the trail of whether
neuroscience and the cognitive world can finally be brought to-
gether. That is indeed an exciting prospect. But my message relates
to symbolic architectures and all the other good things that connec-
tionism sees as the conceptual frame to overthrow. So the final risk
is that my timing is terrible. John Anderson had it right when he
wrote his book on the architecture of human cognition for publica-
tion in 1983. It is too late now.

Believe me, I feel these risks in making the case for unified theo-
ries of cognition by putting forward a single candidate and riding
that candidate for seven chapters. Iterating through the list of con-
ceivable types of risks at the outset is clearly an attempt on my part
to disarm the critics in advance. But having made my magic incan-
tations, it is now time to get on with the business at hand. I do have
one fast verbal amulet. The late Warren McCulloch, one of the
world’s great cyberneticists, when attacked sharply at talks, often
used to respond with “Don’t bite my finger, look where I’m point-
ing’ (McCulloch, 1965, p. iv). Indeed, I will appropriate this epi-
gram as my motto here. Iam sure Warren would not mind.

1.4.2. The Vehicle: Soar

There are still two more preliminaries. First, there needs to be the
vehicle. I will propose a system called Soar as a candidate unified
theory. Soar is an architecture for general intelligence, developed
by John Laird, at the University of Michigan, Paul Rosenbloom, at
the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern
California, and myself. Soar was first realized as a computer pro-
gram in 1983 (Laird, Rosenbloom, & Newell, i986), and there is a
current operational version, Soar4.4 (Laird, Newell, & Rosenb-
