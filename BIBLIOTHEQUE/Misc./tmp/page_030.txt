Unified Theories of Cognition = 17

tively content free but that permit specific cognitive theories to be
inserted in them in some fashion.
The book is titled Unified Theories of Cognition. It is not titled

* The Unified Theory of Cognition. This is an important point. I am

not asserting that there is a unique unified theory and we should all
get together on it. In the current state of the art, multiple theories
are the best that we can do. The task at hand is to try to get some
candidate theories that have a large enough scope in order to get the
gains inherent in such unification, and to show us all that they are
real. The task is somehow to cajole ourselves into putting it all
together, even though we don't know many of the mechanisms that
are operating. The long run can be entrusted to take care of the
eventual emergence of a single unified theory and how that conver-
gence or selection will take place.

Thus, there will be multiple unified theories for quite a while—if
we can just get a few started, to show the way. My concern is that
each one, itself, should be unified. We should be comparing one
unified theory with another. From what has already been said it
should be understood that any such theory will be inadequate and
so it will change and grow. What I want is for psychology to begin
working with much more integrated theories. This is what I want to
make plausible and attractive in this book.

1.2.1 Why Strive for Unified Theories?

As members of a scientific community, we all understand auto-
matically that unification is a good thing. It is an ‘apple pie" of sci-
ence. I clearly have more than this in mind in urging unified theo-
ties on psychology at this particular time. Figure 1-6 gives my list
of reasons.

Most important, beyond the apple-pie reason, is that a single
system (mind) produces all aspects of behavior. It is one mind that
minds them all. Even if the mind has parts, modules, components,
or whatever, they all mesh together to produce behavior. Any bit of
behavior has causal tendrils that extend back through large parts of
the total cognitive system before grounding in the environmental
situation of some earlier times. If a theory covers only one part or
component, it flirts with trouble from the start. It goes without
saying that there are dissociations, independencies, impenetra-
bilities, and modularities. These all help to break the web of each
bit of behavior being shaped by an unlimited set of antecedents. So
