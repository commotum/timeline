than due to a malfunction of one of its components. It appears that
this probability may be reduced, however, to a quantity no greater
than the typical probabilities of an error due to malfunctions in

electronic equipment.

The system has three main components, as indicated in
Fige 1:

(1) The S-System (Sensory System) can be represented as a
set of points in a TV raster, or as a set of photocells, Each raster=
point in the S-system is connected to a number of units in the A-system
(Association System), to which impulses are transmitted when the S-point
is "on" (illuminated). Any particular S-A connection may be either
positive (carrying positive or "excitatory" signals to the A-unit) or
negative (tending to inhibit or suppress activity of the A-unit). A
given point in the S-raster, for example, might be positively connected

to ten A-units, and negatively connected to another ten units,

(2) The A-System (Association System) performs the switching
functions between input and output. Each A-unit receives impulses from
a number of S=points, and transmits outputs to one or more Response
Units (R-Units). The A-Units are characterized by the fixed parameter 8,
the threshold value which corresponds to the algebraic sum of input
pulses necessary to evoke an output, and the stochastic variable vs, the
Noutput value", which may be any physically measurable characteristic of
the output pulse, such as amplitude, frequency, or delay-period. The
value of an A-unit's output will vary with its history, and acts as a

counter, or register for the memory~function of the system.

(3) The R-System (Response System) consists typically of a
relatively small number of units, which may operate type-bars or signal
lights, and which are activated when the mean or net value of the signals

received from the A-System exceeds a critical level @,20 In addition to
