I PRM Visualizations

All examples shown come from the large-scale generator (GPT-4). We note
the pass-rate under the generator to give some sense of the difficulty of these
problems.

I.1 True Positives

These cherry-picked examples show the best-of-1860 solution from the generator
as ranked by the large-scale PRM.

Problem 1. Generator pass-rate: 0.1%. This challenging trigonometry problem
requires applying several identities in a not-at-all obvious succession. Most
solution attempts fail, because it is hard to choose which identities are actually
helpful. Though successful solutions to this problem are rare, the reward model
correctly recognizes when a valid chain-of-thought has been found.
