called the base-level problem space (BLS), because it is the one that
governs interaction with the external world (Rosenbloom, Laird, &
Newell, 1988a). Figure 5-4 provides a picture.

The base-level problem space is also the one space that doesn’t
arise from an impasse and is always in place as the top of the
context stack (hence it is also called the top space). It is the space
within which an initial impasse occurs and from which the stack of
contexts grows as impasses occur within impasses. A moment’s
thought shows that one space must exist that does not arise from an
impasse. Just ascend the stack of goal contexts—it is a finite struc-
ture and must terminate in some top context, which then necessar-
ily did not come from any impasse. Suppose this top space of the
context stack were not also the base space that contains perception
codes, motor commands, and the operators that deal with them.
Then somehow there would have to be some lack of knowledge in
this space that would force an impasse into the base (I/O) space. It
is a little hard to imagine what that lack would be, especially since it
must be related to what is going on in the top space.

For immediate-response tasks, almost all the internal action
takes place in BLS. Only when an impasse occurs will other prob-
