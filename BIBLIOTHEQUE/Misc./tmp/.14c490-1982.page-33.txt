the complex of prestriate cortex the two cortical visual systems begin to
diverge. On the assumption that both systems can indeed be followed
stepwise to our target areas, not only in the temporal but also in the
parietal lobe, a major question for the future will be how the object and
spatial information carried in these two separated systems are sub-
sequently integrated into a unified visual percept.

Acknowledgments

We gratefully acknowledge the contribution of past members of the
Laboratory of Neuropsychology at the National Institute of Mental
Health: Eiichi Iwai, Charlene Drew Jarvis, Michael E. Lewis, Walter G.
Pohl, and Marvin Snyder. We also wish to thank our collaborators from
other laboratories: Charles G. Gross and David B. Bender at Princeton
University, Edward G. Jones at Washington University, Charles Ken-
nedy and Louis Sokoloff at NIMH, and Blair H. Turner at Howard Uni-
versity. Skillful technical assistance was provided by Margaret E.
Knapp, Bertha McClure, and George Creswell. The research was sup-
ported in part by the National Institutes of Health under postdoctoral
fellowship EY05009.
