                    Atari games have been a long-standing bench-

                    nity for the past decade. This benchmark was
                    proposed to test general competency of RL al-
                    gorithms. Previous work has achieved good av-

                    on many games of the set, but very poorly in
                    several of the most challenging games. We pro-
                    pose Agent57, the ﬁrst deep RL agent that out-
                    performs the standard human benchmark on all
                    57Atari games. To achieve this result, we train a
                    neural network which parameterizes a family of
