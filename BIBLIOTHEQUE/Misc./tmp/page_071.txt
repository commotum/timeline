system, in whose interior is another situation, the representation of
the blocks world. This interior situation is equally part of the total
world, of course, and consists of some physical system that goes
through transformations as well, to produce another interior situa-
tion. The question is, What is the nature of the interior system for it
to be a representation of the particular blocks situation in the exter-
nal world?

I've chosen a rather unfamiliar way of representing the blocks
world in Figure 2-6. Each stack of blocks corresponds to a family—
the Jones family and the Smith family—and the children ina family
are the blocks in order of age, youngest on top. The transformation
is that people die and get born. If Andy Jones dies and Alex Smith is
born, then the Jones family only has Billy and the Smith family has
Alex and Chuck. To ask a question, such as whether a given block,
say B, is clear, is to ask who is the youngest child ina family. In the
initial situation, Billy is not the youngest, although after Andy dies,
he becomes the youngest.

There is a clear correspondence between the external blocks
world and family situations. Some of the properties correspond
(being clear, and being the youngest), but not all (are the blocks
square, or are the children boys or girls?). Some of the transforma-
tions correspond (moving blocks, and birthing/dying), but not all
(blocks falling over, and the children growing older).

The representation is somewhat odd—I chose it to avoid the
obvious ways we would create such representations if we were
doing it on paper or in a computer—but it’s actually not as far-
fetched as you might think. According to a long tradition in an-
thropology (Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition, 1982),
when one attempts to get members of primitive tribes to reason on
isolated, abstract logical tasks, they tend not to work with the ab-
stract situations but to deal only with concrete situations with
which they are thoroughly familiar. In fact, that is true with people
in our own society. People are better on syllogisms if they are cast
in concrete terms rather than expressed abstractly. For instance,
reporting an experiment on syllogistic reasoning Johnson-Laird and
Bara (1984, p. 20) noted that the data for one person had to be
discarded because she said she couldn’t imagine any particular con-
crete situation that corresponded to a particular syllogism, so she
was unable even to work on the task (in fact, the scenario involved

a family).
