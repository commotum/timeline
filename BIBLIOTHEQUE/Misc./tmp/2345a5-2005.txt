                  Recall that striatal cells expressing D2 receptors pre-   on Go/No-Go activity levels is that they drive activity-
               dominate in the indirect/No-Go pathway, which is             dependent learning to synaptic input. A well-established
               thought to act as a brake on a particular action or set      principle should hold across both Go and No-Go cells:

             on plasticity. If DA bursts during reinforcement are
             adaptive, they should have the complementary effects
             of increasing Go learning while decreasing No-Go learn-
             ing so that reinforced responses are more likely to be
             facilitated in the future. Because DA enhances activity in
             the direct pathway, bursts may indeed induce LTP in Go
             cells. Further, the inhibitory effects of DA in the indirect
             pathway may induce LTD in No-Go cells so that they
             learn to become less active. This hypothesis is supported
             by demonstrations that DA induces LTP via D1 receptors
             and LTD via D2 receptors (Kerr & Wickens, 2001;
             Calabresi et al., 1997).
                The same principle can be applied to predict the
             effect of DA dips, which, if they are adaptive, should
             enhance No-Go learning so that nonreinforcing re-
             sponses are actively suppressed in the future. Because
             DAdipsreleaseNo-Gocellsintheindirect pathway from
             DA inhibition, the increased No-Go activity should in-
             duce LTP in No-Go cells. Although LTP has not been
             tested during endogenous DA dips, this hypothesis is
             indirectly supported by examining the effects of D2
             receptor blockade, assuming that DA dips decrease D2
             stimulation and should therefore have the same quali-
             tative effects on the indirect pathway as D2 blockade.

        Figure 4. A positive feedback trial in the weather prediction task, for both intact and ‘‘Parkinson’’ networks. This trial consists of two cues,
        represented by the two columns of active units in the input layer. Intact (choice): Response selection (minus phase) activity in the intact
        network. Early in training, the BG has not learned to gate either response, as shown by an active GPi and inhibited thalamus. The PMC is weakly
        active due to direct connections from sensory input. The most active (left) unit in the PMC, corresponding to ‘‘sun,’’ determines the output
        response. Intact (feedback): Because the model ‘‘guessed’’ correctly, a phasic burst of DA firing occurs in the SNc. This has the effect of activating
        Go units associated with the selected response (via D1 contrast enhancement), and suppressing No-Go units (via D2 inhibition). Weights are
        adjusted based on differences in network activity between the minus and plus phases. The enhanced Go representation in the plus phase
        drives learning to gate the ‘‘sun’’ response. PD (choice): Response selection (minus phase) activity in the PD network, for the same trial. Note
        the reduced number of intact SNc units, which causes the No-Go units to be more active. Again, there is no BG gating early in training and the
        modelselects a random response from sensory–motor projections. PD (feedback): Correct guessing leads to a phasic burst of DA in the plus phase.
        However, this phasic burst is not as effective because it applies to only one SNc unit, and therefore only weakly activates more Go units while
        some No-Go activity persists. Reduced dynamic range of DA in the PD network results in less difference in activity levels between the two phases
        of network settling, causing less learning.

            Figure 5. A negative feedback trial in the weather prediction task for both intact and ‘‘Parkinson’’ networks. Intact (choice): A single cue is
            presented. Based on previous learning, the Go units for ‘‘rain’’ are sufficiently active to gate that response, indicated by the inhibition of right
            GPi units and disinhibition of the right thalamus unit. Intact (feedback): The feedback on this particular trial is negative (due to probabilistic
            outcomes), shown by a phasic dip of DA firing in the SNc. The lack of DA removes suppression of No-Go units via D2 receptors, which are then
            more active than the Go units. The DA dip therefore drives No-Go learning to the incorrect response selected for this cue. Note the output
            layer displays the target response for the trial, but this is not used as a training signal: The only signal driving learning is the change in SNc
            DA. PD (choice): The PD network has also learned to gate the ‘‘rain’’ response for this same trial, based on previous learning. PD (feedback):
            Feedback is incorrect, and the phasic dip of DA in the SNc leads to activation of some No-Go units. However, the PD network already had low

        Figure 6. A trial in the probabilistic reversal task. Two cues are presented at the input, and the model has to select one of them (see Methods
        for details). The trial shown here is in the reversal stage, during which the model has to learn ‘‘No-Go’’ to the prepotent response before it can
        switch to selecting the alternative. Reduced dynamic range of DA in the ‘‘overdosed’’ (OD) network causes degraded ability to learn No-Go. Intact
        (choice): Based on learning in the acquisition stage, the network chooses the stimulus on the right (Resp2). Intact (feedback): In the reversal
        stage, this choice is incorrect. Phasic dips in SNc release No-Go units from suppression, so that the network can subsequently learn not to
        perseverate. OD (choice): The same trial is presented to the OD network. Unimpaired Go learning in the acquisition stage results in selection of
        the same response as the intact network. OD (feedback): A phasic dip is applied to SNc on incorrect trials in the reversal stage, but a residual level
        of activation due to simulated medication results in weaker activation of No-Go units. The network then takes longer to unlearn the initial
        response, causing reversal deficits.
