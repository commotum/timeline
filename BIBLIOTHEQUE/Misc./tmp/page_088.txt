Hidden in this account is the basic proposition behind informa-

, tion theory, namely, for a given technology there is a limit to the

amount of encoding that can occupy a given region of physical
space. In information theory this is expressed as the channel or
memory capacity, and it is measured in bits. But its foundation is
the amount of variety in physical structure, given that there is a
limit to the amount of energy that is available to detect differences
in structure (which is the aspect of the coding technology that is
relevant). This limitation applies to all systems, discrete and con-
tinuous (Shannon, 1949). Thus, as the demands for variety in-
crease—corresponding ultimately to the demands for variety in
functions to be composed—the local capacity will be exceeded and
distal access will be required to variety that exists elsewhere. There
must be something within the local site that indicates that additional
knowledge is needed and provides clues to how to obtain it. This
requirement that complex systems require symbol structures, in the
sense of embedded symbol tokens that provide distal access, is
separate from the notion of representation. It is a requirement that
arises from the constraints of processing, not from the constraints
of establishing relations to the external world.

The scheme represented in Figure 2-10 shows symbol tokens as

we normally think of them, as regions of a structure used to access

distal data on demand, when processing occurs at that site. Some
alternatives are possible. For instance, in the fashion of a drum
machine, global sweeps of the total memory could occur periodic-
ally, rather than individual accesses on demand. A uniform access
process of this sort might seem necessarily Jess efficient than indi-
vidual accesses, but efficiency depends on the underlying technol-
ogy (so, for instance, drum machines dictated such a scheme). In
