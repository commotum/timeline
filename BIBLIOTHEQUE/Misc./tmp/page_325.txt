operator selection, to build plans and then use them to control
search. These aspects pertain to the procedural side of memory. On
the declarative side, Soar has learned to recognize objects and to
recall objects when given some cues. With respect to tasks, it has
learned problem spaces and also initial and desired states. All of
this learning is accomplished through chunking—by doing some
task whose result is the building of chunks that resolve impasses.
By its nature, chunking works on any type of task, and it has in fact
been demonstrated in a miscellaneous but diverse collection of puz-
zles, games, design tasks (such as R1-Soar and algorithm design),
and diagnosis tasks (such as Neomycin-Soar). Again, by its nature,
chunking occurs on all conceivable occasions, but it is comforting
to know that this actually happens. This includes, by the way,
learning both on success and on failure. Chunking is not sensitive to
success and failure, only to whatever resolves an impasse. An im-
passe can be resolved as much by failure—the decision to leave a
space as unprofitable—as by success.

In sum, the demonstrations of learning in Soar are scattered
widely throughout the range of our experiences with it. Soar is not
limited to learning that is somehow narrowly focused on specific
types, occasions, or experiments. The ubiquity of learning is clearly
a phenomenon that characterizes human behavior, and one that a
unified theory of cognition should explain. Although we have no
systematic way to assess the diversity and pervasiveness of its
learning, Soar as a theory of cognition can be taken as predicting
this characteristic of human behavior.

No examples have been provided yet of learning from an external
source of knowledge. Here are two from the work of Andy Golding
(Golding, Rosenbloom, and Laird, 1987). Figure 6-4 shows a case of
taking direct advice. The task domain is very simple—solving
elementary algebraic equations. The initial state contains an equa-
tion, a» &’ = —c — x, which is to be solved for x. The problem
space contains operators that modify the form of the equation while
preserving equality. We are not interested in this trivial bit of prob-
lem solving; it serves only to show how Soar obtains guidance from
outside. Soar runs into a tie impasse immediately, because it does
not know which operator to try. The tie impasse leads it into a
selection space to resolve the tie. This selection space has
operators to evaluate alternatives (the alternatives in this case being
operators in the higher space). So far, this is just like blocks-world
