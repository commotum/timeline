and asks what are the plausible hypotheses that could satisfy the
unsatisfied expectations. This is a heuristic generator that produces
plausible hypotheses for what could satisfy the unfulfilled expecta-
tions. It is not blind, of course, since it can examine these expecta-
tions as well as the surrounding context of sentence analysis. In the
present case, it hypothesizes that if the word check would create a
domain object, then this would satisfy the existing dangling expec-
tations, [Generate-interpretations] produces a data structure that
represents this comprehension operator for the word check. In the
trace, this object is put in brackets like an operator but is labeled
data, so its role is not mistaken.

In this simple example, only this one hypothesis gets generated.
In more complicated situations than this, a collection of hypotheses
