# Don't Throw the Baby Out with the Bathwater: How and Why Deep Learning for ARC (2025)
Source: c1ab73-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper's main contribution is to change inference by optimizing in the evaluation loop via test-time fine-tuning.
- It proposes a test-time augmentation/inference/voting mechanism (AIRV) to improve ARC solutions.

## Evidence extracts
- "3.2  Solution Part 2: Optimizing in the Evaluation Loop (Test-Time Fine Tuning)" (p. 6)
- "This procedure can be seen as a form of test-time training [27] and is referred to here as Test-Time Fine Tuning (TTFT)." (p. 6)
- "Wepropose a test-time augmentation strategy called Augment, Inference, Reverse-Augmentation, and Vote (AIRV)." (p. 7)
