# Machine Learning for Modular Multiplication (2024)
Source: a897aa-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper investigates learning modular multiplication using two ML approaches (circular regression and sequence-to-sequence transformers) and reports their limitations, which is an empirical study of learning behavior rather than a new positional encoding or dimensional adaptation.
- Its main contribution is analysis of training and generalization performance on arithmetic tasks, fitting ML methodology/foundations rather than datasets or new computation mechanisms.

## Evidence extracts
- "we investigate two machine learning approaches to modular multiplication: namely circular regression and a sequence-to-sequence transformer model. The limited success of both methods demonstrated in our results gives evidence for the hardness of tasks involving modular multiplication" (p. 1, Abstract)
- "we largely observe 0% accuracy on the test set (inputs not observed during training) across different choices of prime modulus, base and secret" (p. 11, Section 3.4)
