# The Organization of Behavior (1949)
Source: 0443e5-1949.pdf

## Core reasons
- The excerpt frames the work as bridging psychology with biology and neurophysiology, positioning it as cross-disciplinary foundations rather than an ML method.
- The content is theoretical discussion of behavior and brain function, not a machine learning architecture, dataset, or evaluation.

## Evidence extracts
- "However, psychology has an intimate relation with
  the other biological sciences, and may also look for
  help there. There is a considerable overlap between the
  problems of psychology and those of neurophysiology,
  hence the possibility (or necessity) of reciprocal assis-
  tance. The first object of this book is to present a theory
  of behavior for the consideration of psychologists; but
  another is to seek a common ground with the anato-
  mist, physiologist, and neurologist, to show them how '
  psychological theory relates to their problems and at
  the same time to make it more possible for them to
  contribute to that theory." (p. 4)
- "Modern psychology takes completely for granted
  that behavior and neural function are perfectly cor-
  related, that one is completely caused by the other." (p. 5)
