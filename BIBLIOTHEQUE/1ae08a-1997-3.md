# Long Short-Term Memory (1997)
Source: 1ae08a-1997.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes LSTM as a novel recurrent network architecture and learning algorithm, indicating a new computation mechanism for sequence memory.
- Addresses long time-lag learning by enforcing constant error flow through special units, indicating a mechanism for long-term memory.

## Evidence extracts
- "This paper presents \Long Short-Term Memory" (LSTM), a novel recurrent networkarchitecturein conjunction with an appropriate gradient-basedlearning algorithm." (p. 1)
- "Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete time steps by enforcing constant error ow through \constant error carrousels" within special units." (p. 1)
