# Working Memory (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: 1110ea-1974.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper focuses on human short-term/working memory and its role in normal human information processing and cognition, not on machine learning models.
- It frames a psychological memory system as central to tasks like problem solving, language comprehension, and long-term learning, making it cross-disciplinary foundational context.

## Evidence extracts
- "Despite more than a decade of intensive research on the topic of short-term memory (STM), we still know virtually nothing about its role in normal human information processing." (p. 1)
- "The short-term store (STS)-the hypothetical memory system which is assumed to be responsible for performance in tasks involving short- term memory paradigms (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968)-has been as- signed a crucial role in the performance of a wide range of tasks including problem solving (Hunter, 1964), language comprehension (Rumelhart, Lindsay, & Norman, 1972) and most notably, long-term learning (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968; Waugh & Norman, 1965)."
