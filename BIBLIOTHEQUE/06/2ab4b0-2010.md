# The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory? (2010)
Source: 2ab4b0-2010.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is a neuroscience review that situates the free-energy principle among biological and physical theories of brain function rather than proposing an ML method.
- Its contribution is a cross-disciplinary theoretical framework about self-organizing systems minimizing free energy, which serves as conceptual grounding for learning systems.

## Evidence extracts
- "This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective." (p. 1)
- "The free-energy principle (BOX 1) says that any self-organizing system that is at equilibrium with its environment must minimize its free energy2." (p. 1)
