## Evidence extracts
- "Psyclwology hag arrived at.the possibility of unified theories of cogni-
  tlon--teories.that gain their power by positing a single system of
  mechanisms that operate,together to produce the full range of human
  cognition." (p. 14)
- "Allen Newell, a leading researcher in computer science and cognitive
  psychology, makes the case for unified theories of cognition by seting
  forth a candidate: Soar, an architecture for general cognition. A pioneer
  system in artificial intelligence, Soar i the fist problem solver to create
  its own subgoals and lear continuously from its own experince, thus
  illustrating important characteristics ofthe human cognitive structure." (p. 561)
