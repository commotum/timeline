# Quantifying the Rise and Fall of Complexity in Closed Systems: The Coffee Automaton (2014)
Source: 3aafc4-2014.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper studies complexity behavior in closed physical systems, not machine learning models.
- The model system is a stochastic cellular automaton of coffee/cream mixing, indicating a statistical mechanics/complex systems focus.

## Evidence extracts
- "Thus, it appears that the coﬀee cup system starts out at a state of low complexity, and that the complexity ﬁrst increases and then decreases over time." (p. 2)
- "The coﬀee cup system that we use as our model is a simple stochastic cellular automaton." (p. 10)
