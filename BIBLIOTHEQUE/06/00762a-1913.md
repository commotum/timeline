# An Example of Statistical Investigation of the Text Eugene Onegin Concerning the Connection of Samples in Chains (2006)
Source: 00762a-1913.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is a statistical/probability analysis of letter sequences in a literary text, not a machine learning or transformer method.
- It models dependent samples as chains and computes transition probabilities between vowels and consonants, reflecting mathematical foundations work.

## Evidence extracts
- "This sequence provides us with 20,000 connected trials, which are either a vowel or a consonant." (p. 591)
- "Now, if we assume that the sequence of 20,000 letters forms a simple chain, then" (p. 596)
