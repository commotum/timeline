# A simple neural network module for relational reasoning (2017)
Source: 4c6c65-2017.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes Relation Networks as a plug-and-play module specifically to solve problems that hinge on relational reasoning, addressing a missing capability in standard neural networks.
- Defines an RN architecture whose computation explicitly models relations over object pairs, making relational reasoning a built-in computation mechanism.

## Evidence extracts
- "Then, using a curated dataset called Sort-of-CLEVR we show
that powerful convolutional networks do not have a general capacity to solve relational questions,
but can gain this capacity when augmented with RNs." (p. 1)
- "An RN is a neural network module with a structure primed for relational reasoning. The design
philosophy behind RNs is to constrain the functional form of a neural network so that it captures the
core common properties of relational reasoning." (p. 2)
