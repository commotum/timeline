# A free energy principle for the brain (2006)
Source: 266d36-2006.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is a neuroscience-focused conceptual account of brain function and perceptual inference rather than an ML model or dataset contribution.
- It frames perception and action within a free energy principle for biological systems, offering cross-disciplinary theoretical grounding.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, we show these perceptual processes are just one aspect of emergent behaviours of systems that conform to a free energy" (Abstract)
- "hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a" (Abstract)
