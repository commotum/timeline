# Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex (2005)
Source: 242596-2005.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper reports neuroscientific findings about spatial mapping in the entorhinal cortex, not a machine learning model or method.
- The contribution is biological evidence about neural representations of space, providing cross-disciplinary context rather than ML infrastructure or algorithms.

## Evidence extracts
- "The ability to find one's way depends on neural algorithms that integrate information about place, distance and direction, but the implementation of these operations in cortical microcircuits is poorly understood." (Abstract)
- "Here we show that the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) contains a directionally oriented, topographically organized neural map of the spatial environment." (Abstract)
