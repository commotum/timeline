# The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information (1956)
Source: 0780cb-1956.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is an experimental psychology analysis of human information-processing limits, focusing on absolute judgment and immediate memory rather than machine learning models.
- It frames human perception and memory as a communication channel and quantifies capacity limits, serving as cross-disciplinary context for learning research.

## Evidence extracts
- "In the experiments on absolute judgment, the observer is considered to be a communication channel." (p. 82)
- "Everybody knows that there is a finite span of immediate memory and that for a lot of different kinds of test materials this span is about seven items in length." (p. 91)
