# Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed (1924)
Source: 008874-1924.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is about telegraph transmission, explicitly focusing on signal shaping and code choice to maximize telegraph speed, which is outside ML model design.
- It formalizes the speed of transmission of intelligence in terms of current values, grounding the work in communications engineering rather than ML methods.

## Evidence extracts
- "Synopsts: This paper considers two fundamental factors entering
into the maximum speed of “transmission of intelligence by telegraph.
These factors are signal shaping and choice of codes." (p. 1)
- "Use has been made of the formula

W=K log m

where W =the speed of transmission of intelligence
K =aconstant

and m =the number of current values employed." (p. 19)
