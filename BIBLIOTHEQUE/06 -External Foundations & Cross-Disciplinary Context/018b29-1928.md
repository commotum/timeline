# Transmission of Information (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: 018b29-1928.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper develops a quantitative, physically grounded measure of information to compare communication systems rather than proposing machine learning methods.
- The focus is on telegraphy/telephony/picture transmission and frequency-range constraints, providing cross-disciplinary foundations relevant to information theory.

## Evidence extracts
- "What I hope to accomplish in this direction is to set up a quantitative measure whereby the capacities of various systems to transmit information may be compared." (p. 1)
- "This measure has been shown to be the product of the width of the frequency-range over which steady state alternating currents are transmitted with sensibly uniform efficiency and the time during which the system is available." (p. 29)
