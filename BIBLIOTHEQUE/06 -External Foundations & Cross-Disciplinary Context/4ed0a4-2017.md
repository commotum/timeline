# Kolmogorov Complexity and Algorithmic Randomness (2017)
Source: 4ed0a4-2017.pdf

## Core reasons
- The document is a mathematics monograph on algorithmic randomness and Kolmogorov complexity, not a machine learning or transformer-focused contribution.
- It explicitly lists Mathematics Subject Classification codes, indicating its primary domain is mathematical logic/computability theory rather than ML datasets, architectures, or benchmarks.

## Evidence extracts
- "Kolmogorov Complexity and Algorithmic Randomness" (p. 1)
- "2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.  Primary 68Q30, 03D32, 60A99, 97K70." (p. 4)
