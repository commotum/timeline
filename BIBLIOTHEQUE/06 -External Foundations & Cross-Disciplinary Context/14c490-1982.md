# Two Cortical Visual Systems (1982)
Source: 14c490-1982.pdf

## Core reasons
- The content focuses on cortical visual pathways, lesions, and perceptual deficits in primate brains rather than machine learning methods.
- The study is rooted in neuroscience and experimental brain-behavior techniques, making it cross-disciplinary context rather than ML research.

## Evidence extracts
- "Damage to the primary visual cortex (striate cortex or area 17), either by disease, by acute assault, or through surgical intervention for therapeutic purposes, results in a scotoma or blind region in the visual field." (p. 3)
- "In our investigations of the two cortical visual systems, we have used the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) as our subject and have employed a combination of behavioral, electrophysiological, and anatomical techniques." (p. 4)
