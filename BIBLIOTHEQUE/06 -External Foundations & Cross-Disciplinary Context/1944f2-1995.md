Source: 1944f2-1995.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is authored from a neurobiology context and focuses on biological mechanisms of working memory rather than ML model design.
- It analyzes neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex, indicating a neuroscience review rather than an ML contribution.

## Evidence extracts
- "Section  of Neurobiology" (p. 1)
- "prefrontal  neurons  have \"memory  fields,\"" (p. 2)
