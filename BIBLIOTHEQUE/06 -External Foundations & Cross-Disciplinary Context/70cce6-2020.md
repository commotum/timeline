# Going in circles is the way forward: the role of recurrence in visual inference (2020)
Source: 70cce6-2020.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is a neurobiology review about recurrent computation in primate visual cortex, not a machine learning method or dataset.
- It provides cross-disciplinary conceptual context on why recurrence matters for visual inference, rather than proposing a new ML architecture or positional encoding.

## Evidence extracts
- "The primate visual cortex uses a recurrent algorithm to process sensory input" (Introduction, p. 177)
- "This review comes from a themed issue on Whole-brain interactions between neural circuits" (p. 176)
