# Cauchy and the Gradient Method (2012)
Source: 0020c8-1847.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper frames itself around classical optimization topics and terms, indicating a mathematical optimization focus rather than ML architectures or datasets.
- It describes the gradient method itself, reinforcing that the contribution is historical/mathematical context about optimization techniques.

## Evidence extracts
- "Keywords and Phrases: Unconstrained optimization, descen
t method,
least-square method" (p. 1)
- "One iteration of the gradient method is thus stated, with two" (p. 3)
