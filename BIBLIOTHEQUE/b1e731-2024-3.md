# Searching Latent Program Spaces (2024)
Source: b1e731-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper emphasizes that current neural program synthesis lacks structured test-time search and motivates adding such inference-time computation.
- It introduces the Latent Program Network as a mechanism for test-time adaptation by searching a continuous latent program space, i.e., a change in how computation happens at inference.

## Evidence extracts
- "Most neural methods lack structured search mechanisms during inference, relying instead on stochastic sampling or gradient updates, which can be inefficient." (p. 1)
- "LPN builds a mechanism for test-time adaptation directly into the neural architecture, without the need for parameter updates, and utilizes a training objective suitable to test-time search." (p. 2)
