# Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? (1935)
Source: 01f22f-1935.pdf

## Core reasons
- Focuses on quantum mechanics and physical reality (wave functions and completeness), a physics foundation topic outside ML model design.
- Provides conceptual grounding about completeness of physical theories rather than ML datasets, architectures, or training methods.

## Evidence extracts
- "Can Quantum-Mechanical                         Description         of Physical Reality Be Considered                          Complete' ?" (p. 1)
- "of the first particle,           by the wave function is not complete or (2) when" (p. 4)
