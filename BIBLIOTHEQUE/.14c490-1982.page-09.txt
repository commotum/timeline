found on tests in which the animal was required to choose a response
location on the basis of its proximity to a visual ‘‘landmark” (see part A
of figure 18.5). The results suggested that “. . . the inferior temporal
cortex participates mainly in the acts of noticing and remembering an
object’s qualities, not its position in space,’”’ and that ‘conversely, the
posterior parietal cortex seems to be concerned with the perception of
spatial relations among objects, and not their intrinsic qualities” (Mish-
kin 1972).

Accumulating evidence from other laboratories supports this view of
posterior parietal function. Not only has the impairment of landmark
tasks after posterior parietal lesions been corroborated (Milner et al.
1977; Ungerleider and Brody 1977; Brody and Pribram 1978; however,
see Ridley and Ettlinger 1975), but impairments after such lesions have
also been found on other visual spatial tasks, including a stylus maze
(Milner et al. 1977), patterned-string tests (Ungerleider and Brody 1977),
cage finding (Sugishita et al. 1978), and route following (Petrides and
Iversen 1979). Visual spatial disorientation, however, is not the only
deficit produced by lesions of this region. Indeed, the classical symp-
toms of posterior parietal dysfunction are misreaching in the dark as
well as in the light (Ettlinger and Wegener 1958; Bates and Ettlinger
1960; Ettlinger and Kalsbeck 1962; Hartje and Ettlinger 1973; LaMotte
and Acuna 1978; Faugier-Grimaud et al. 1978; Stein 1978), contralateral
neglect of auditory and tactile as well as visual stimuli (Denny-Brown
and Chambers 1958; Heilman et al. 1970), and impairments of tactile
discrimination (Blum 1951; Pribram and Barry 1956; Wilson 1957, 1975;
Ettlinger and Wegener 1958; Pasik et al. 1958; Bates and Ettlinger 1960;
Wilson et al. 1960; Ettlinger and Kalsbeck 1962; Ettlinger et al. 1966;
Moffett et al. 1967; Moffett and Ettlinger 1970; Ridley and Ettlinger
1975).

The posterior parietal lesions in these studies have nearly always in-
cluded two or even more cytoarchitectonic areas, and so it is natural to
assume that the heterogeneity of effects is a consequence of the het-
erogeneity of the tissue included in the removals. However, the few
studies that have directly examined this question (Moffett et al. 1967;
Ridley and Ettlinger 1975) failed to uncover any clear-cut instance of
functional dissociation. From the evidence at hand, the most par-
simonious interpretation is one that has been offered by Semmes
(1967), namely, that the multiple deficits are but different reflections
of a single, supramodal spatial disorder (see also Ratcliff et al. 1977).
According to this view, and in the light of more recent anatomical in-
formation (Pandya and Kuypers 1969; Jones and Powell 1970), a su-
pramodal spatial framework could be constructed out of converging
inputs to posterior parietal cortex from all exteroceptive sensory mo-
dalities, with a significant contribution from vision. In the studies in our
laboratory that followed the “landmark” experiment by Pohl (1973), we
addressed the questions raised above regarding localization of spatial
