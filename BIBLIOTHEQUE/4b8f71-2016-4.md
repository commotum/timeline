# SyGuS-Comp 2016: Results and Analysis (2016)
Source: 4b8f71-2016.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper’s main contribution is the SyGuS competition report, which evaluates synthesis techniques and reports competition results.
- It focuses on benchmark infrastructure, detailing competition benchmarks and adding a large new PBE benchmark set.

## Evidence extracts
- "for evaluating different synthesis techniques on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. In this year’s competition we added a new track devoted to programming by examples. This track consisted of two categories, one using the theory of bit-vectors and one using the theory of strings. This paper presents and analyses the results of SyGuS-Comp’16." (p. 2)
- "In addition to last year’s competition benchmarks, we had 858 new benchmarks for the Programming ByExample(PBE)track." (p. 8)
