# The LLM ARChitect: Solving ARC-AGI Is A Matter of Perspective (2024)
Source: b3cb55-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper's main contribution is a method pipeline for ARC-AGI that combines data expansion, multi-stage fine-tuning, and solution evaluation for LLMs rather than a new dataset or positional encoding scheme.
- It focuses on training and inference strategies (e.g., augmented data fine-tuning of decoder-only LLMs) to improve ARC-AGI performance, fitting a methodology/optimization contribution.

## Evidence extracts
- "Our approach to solving ARC-AGI combines data expansion, multi-stage fine-tuning of language models, and specialized solution evaluation." (p. 5)
- "We use the augmented data to fine-tune decoder-only LLMs." (p. 4)
