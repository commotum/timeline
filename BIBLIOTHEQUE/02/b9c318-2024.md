# Voxel self-attention and center-point for 3D object detector (2024)
Source: b9c318-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper proposes a 3D LiDAR object detector whose core backbone is a voxel self-attention network, applying attention directly to 3D voxelized data.
- The voxel self-attention module is explicitly compared to a classical transformer module, indicating a transformer-style attention adaptation for 3D voxel relationships.
