# DeLiVoTr: Deep and light-weight voxel transformer for 3D object detection (2024)
Source: a29d32-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper adapts transformer-based feature extraction to LiDAR 3D detection by keeping voxel feature maps at the same scale while using attention to build receptive field, so the model can detect small objects without the semantic loss of downsampling.
- It explicitly groups voxels into regions and uses voxel intra- and inter-region transformers to fuse local and global features before rasterizing to BEV, showing a transformer architecture tailored to 3D voxel representations.

## Evidence extracts
- "To solve this issue we design an architecture that not only maintains the same scale of the feature maps but also the receptive field in the feature extraction network to aid for efficient detection of small size objects. We resort to attention mechanism to build suﬃcient receptive field and we propose a Deep and Light-weight Voxel Transformer (DeLiVoTr) network with voxel intra- and inter-region transformer modules to extract voxel local and global features respectively." (Section 1)
- "In our approach, we divide the voxels into regions similar to SST and employ voxel intra-region transformer to extract voxel local features and further formulate the interactions among the different regions using inter-region attention to extract the voxel global features." (Section 3.3.2)
