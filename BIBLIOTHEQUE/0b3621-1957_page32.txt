PROPOSAL
YOUR ACTION A PERCEIVING AND RECOGNIZING AUTOMATON
(PROJECT PARA)

I. SUMMARY

Establishment of a new research program at Cornell Aeronautical
Laboratory, Inc. is proposed, with the objective of designing, fabricating,
and evaluating an electronic brain model, the photoperceptron. The proposed
pilot model will be capable of "learning" responses to ordinary visual
patterns, or forms. The system will employ a new theory of memory storage,
(the theory of statistical separability), which permits the recognition of
complex petterns with an efficiency far greater than that attainable by
existing computers, Devices of this sort are expected ultimately to be
capable of concept formation, language translation, collation of military
intelligence, and the solution of problems through inductive logic.

The development and construction of a pilot model is expected
to require the wark of three professional people, a digital computer, and
an associated technical staff for eighteen months,

II, INTRODUCTION

With this proposal, a description of an electronic automaton,
the Cornell Photoperceptron, is submitted. This is the outcome of a
program of theoretical studies on the feasibility of an advanced brain
model, which is to be capable of pattern perception and generalization,
The author's work on the "theory of statistical separability", upon which
the perceptron is based, was begun at Cornell University about five years
ago, and has been continued under the sponsorship of the Systems Research
Department of Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc.
