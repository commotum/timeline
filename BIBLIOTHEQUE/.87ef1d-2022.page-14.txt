               Figure 9: Histogram of the number of tokens in arXiv math papers dataset. We tuncated the histogram
               at 500k tokens. The maximum paper had almost 1.6M tokens.
               Figure 10: Histogram of the number of tokens in Github repositories dataset. We cut off the long tail
               of this plot. The repository with the maximum length has just over 9M tokens.

                       Figure 12: Histogram of the number of tokens in PG19 books dataset.
               Figure 13: Histogram of the number of tokens in C4 documents ﬁltered by documents that have less
               than 4096 tokens.
