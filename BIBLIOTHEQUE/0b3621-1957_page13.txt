The input network to the R-units may be designed either
| to sum or to average the inputs received, The design shown merely sums
the inputs, but an averaging system would be preferable, particularly
if the number of simultaneous inputs expected is small. A voltage is
built up across the capacitor of the input integrator at a rate propor-
tional to the net (or mean) input value. A comparator measures the
| difference between this voltage and a fixed reference (@,)» and triggers

| the response unit when the threshold voltage is exceeded,
