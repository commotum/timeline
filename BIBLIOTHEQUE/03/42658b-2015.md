# Neural Programmer-Interpreters (2016)
Source: 42658b-2015.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes the neural programmer-interpreter (NPI), a recurrent and compositional architecture for representing and executing programs, which is a computation mechanism contribution.
- Introduces an explicit program memory with key-value program embeddings to store and invoke programs, changing how computation is carried out.

## Evidence extracts
- "We propose the neural programmer-interpreter (NPI): a recurrent and composi- tional neural network that learns to represent and execute programs." (p. 1)
- "The NPI representation is equipped with key-value memory structures Mkey ∈ RN×K and Mprog ∈ RN×P storing program keys and program embeddings, respectively, where N is the current number of programs in memory." (p. 4)
