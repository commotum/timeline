# Using a recurrent network to bind form, color and position into a unified percept (2001)
Source: 1e6418-2001.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is framed around a "recurrent network" that binds form, color and position into a unified percept, indicating a proposed computation mechanism.
- The focus is on a recurrent-network binding mechanism rather than positional encoding changes or datasets/benchmarks.
