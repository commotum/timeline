# Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory (2016)
Source: 455fc3-2016.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper argues standard neural networks lack external memory for representing variables/data structures and long-timescale storage, indicating a missing computational capability.
- It introduces the differentiable neural computer (DNC), a neural network that reads from and writes to an external memory matrix as a new computation mechanism.

## Evidence extracts
- "Artificial neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing, sequence learning and reinforcement learning, but are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales, owing to the lack of an external memory." (Section Abstract)
- "Here we introduce a machine learning model called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer." (Section Abstract)
