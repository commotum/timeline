# LEARNING WHEN TO PLAN: EFFICIENTLY ALLOCATING TEST-TIME COMPUTE FOR LLM AGENTS (2025)
Source: c2781d-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a dynamic planning framework for LLM agents that decides when to allocate test-time compute, i.e., an adaptive computation/decision mechanism for sequential tasks.
- Emphasizes learning this adaptive planning behavior (via SFT and RL) rather than changing positional encodings or lifting Transformers into higher-dimensional domains.

## Evidence extracts
- "Deciding when to allocate test-time compute for planning is a central challenge for LLM agents." (p. 4)
- "This difficulty underscores the need for learning-based approaches, like SFT and RL, to effectively teach agents this meta-cognitive skill of deciding when to allocate test-time compute for planning." (p. 8)
