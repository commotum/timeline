# Object Representations as Fixed Points: Training Iterative Refinement Algorithms with Implicit Differentiation (2022)
Source: 8b933d-2022.pdf

## Core reasons
- Treats iterative refinement for latent-set representations as a fixed-point computation problem.
- Proposes implicit differentiation as the training mechanism for those fixed-point iterative refinement procedures.

## Evidence extracts
- "                             Ourmaincontribution is to propose treating iterative reﬁnement algorithms used for inferring latent
                             sets as ﬁxed-point procedures, thereby motivating the use of implicit differentiation to train them." (p. 4)

                           for inferring representations of latent sets." (p. 10)
