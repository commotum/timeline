# Relational recurrent neural networks (2018)
Source: 5a2fef-2018.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a new memory module (RMC) to address limitations of standard memory architectures on relational reasoning across time.
- The core contribution is a computation mechanism that enables interactions between memory slots via attention (multi-head dot product attention).

## Evidence extracts
- "remember. Here, we ﬁrst conﬁrm our intuitions that standard memory architectures maystruggle at tasks that heavily involve an understanding of the ways in which entities are connected – i.e., tasks involving relational reasoning. We then improve uponthese deﬁcits by using a new memory module – a Relational Memory Core (RMC)–whichemploysmulti-headdot product attention to allow memories to interact." (p. 1)
- "to memory-augmented architectures we consider a ﬁxed set of memory slots; however, we allow for interactions between memory slots using an attention mechanism." (p. 2)
