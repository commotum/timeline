# Towards Efficient Neurally-Guided Program Induction for ARC-AGI (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: b4065f-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a neurally-guided program induction/search algorithm (GridCoder) that enumerates program space using Transformer-generated token probabilities.
- Focuses on changing the computation/search mechanism for solving ARC-AGI tasks rather than introducing datasets/benchmarks or positional encoding changes.

## Evidence extracts
- "3. We propose a novel probabilistic program enumeration-
based search algorithm for program induction, leaning
heavily on Transformer-based auto-regressive token se-
quences,ratherthanthetypicaln-gramapproach,andan-
alyze its strengths and weaknesses." (p. 1)
- "At a high-level, the solution consists of training a trans-
former to output a program, using a pre-determined gram-
mar(DSL)andsyntax, that solves the task. Specifically, the
transformer outputs a sequence of probabilities over tokens
that can be interpreted as a probability distribution over pro-
gram space. We then use a search algorithm to enumerate
that space and test valid programs for correctness. In a sense," (p. 2)
