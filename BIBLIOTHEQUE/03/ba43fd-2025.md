# ARC-AGI WITHOUT PRETRAINING (2025)
Source: ba43fd-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- CompressARC learns only at inference time on the target puzzle, replacing standard pretraining with test-time optimization.
- The method is grounded in minimizing description length of a programmatic description of the puzzle, i.e., an MDL-based computation mechanism.

## Evidence extracts
- "CompressARC performs all of its learning at inference time and achieves 20% accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 evaluation puzzles—using only the puzzle being solved as input data." (Introduction)
- "CompressARC’s theoretical underpinnings come from minimizing the length of a programmatic description of the target puzzle." (Discussion)
