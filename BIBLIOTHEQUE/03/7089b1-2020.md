# DreamCoder: Growing generalizable, interpretable knowledge with wake-sleep Bayesian program learning (2020)
Source: 7089b1-2020.pdf

## Core reasons
- Frames learning as program induction via search for programs, emphasizing a reasoning/computation paradigm.
- Uses a wake-sleep program learning mechanism where a neural network guides program inference.

## Evidence extracts
- "       Ourformulation of learning as program induction traces back to the earliest days of AI (2): We
      treat learning a new task as search for a program that solves it, or which has intended behavior. Fig. 1" (p. 2)
- "The neural network helps to
               ﬁnd programs solving a task by predicting, conditioned on the observed examples for that task, an
               approximate posterior distribution over programs likely to solve it." (p. 5)
