# Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate (2014)
Source: 397f7b-2014.pdf

## Core reasons
- Identifies the fixed-length encoding bottleneck in encoder–decoder translation models and frames it as the key limitation to address.
- Proposes a new computation mechanism that performs soft alignment/search over source positions during decoding to guide each generated target word.

## Evidence extracts
- "Apotential issue with this encoder–decoder approach is that a neural network needs to be able to compress all the necessary information of a source sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector." (p. 1)
- "In order to address this issue, we introduce an extension to the encoder–decoder model which learns to align and translate jointly." (p. 1)
