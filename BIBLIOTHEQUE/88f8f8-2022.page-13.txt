                                    pacts of different numbers of primitives are provided since primitives are crucial
                                    in the framework. On MSR-Action3D, we can achieve 91.5/91.89 accuracy with
                                    2/8 primitives, resulting in a marginal drop. On Synthia 4D, the segmentation
                                    mIoUs are 82.98, 84.41, 84.49, 84.28, and 83.56 with a primitive number of 10,
                                    100, 200, 400, and 2000 respectively. Notice when the primitive number varies
                                    in a reasonable range from 100 to 400, the segmentation mIoUs vary by no more
                                    than 0.21. When the primitive number is 10, the region division is too coarse
                                    for fine-grained segmentation.When the primitive number is 2000, the benefit of
                                    the spatial hierarchy gets weakened a lot. The network degenerates to a point
                                    transformer when further increasing the primitive number to the point number.
                                    This shows that different numbers of primitives have a small effect on the results,
                                    and all have consistent improvements.
