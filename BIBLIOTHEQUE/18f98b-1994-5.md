# On-line Q-learning Using Connectionist Systems (1994)
Source: 18f98b-1994.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper presents reinforcement learning methodology centered on Q-learning with neural-network function approximation.
- It proposes and analyzes on-line update algorithms for Q-learning, focusing on training/learning procedure changes.

## Evidence extracts
- "Reinforcement learning algorithms are a powerful machine learning technique." (p. 2)
- "In this report, however, we have examined the use of algorithms that can be applied on-line, in the sense that the updates to the neural networks are made at each time step during the trial, without the need to store any state-action information." (p. 4)
