Source: 2e5912-2011.pdf

## Core reasons
- The document identifies itself as a blog post, not a machine learning model or benchmark contribution.
- The discussion is about entropy and Kolmogorov complexity, which is external theoretical context rather than ML methodology.

## Evidence extracts
- "The Blog of Scott Aaronson" (p. 1)
- "As a ﬁrst step, let’s use Kolmogorov complexity to deﬁne entropy." (p. 1)
