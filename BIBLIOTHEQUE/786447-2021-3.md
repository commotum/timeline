# A Neurosymbolic Approach to Abstraction and Reasoning (2021)
Source: 786447-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a reasoning algorithm and program synthesis approach for ARC tasks, focusing on how reasoning/computation is performed.
- Describes a bidirectional, execution-guided search mechanism for solving tasks rather than introducing new data or positional encoding.

## Evidence extracts
- "Second, we design a reasoning algorithm for ARC motivated by the way humans approach solving ARC tasks." (p. 2)
- "Intuitively, this executes a bidirectional search to try to connect the grounded nodes on one side with the ungrounded output node on the other." (p. 25)
