             Preprint, Under Review.
                          9. Approach-Comparison Planner
              Briefly consider possible approaches for the next steps.
              State the approach you choose to take and why it seems preferable to
              alternatives right now.
              Outline the plan based on this chosen approach.
              Output your chosen approach, rationale, and plan strictly in the
              following format:
              <plan>YOUR CHOSEN APPROACH RATIONALE AND PLAN</plan>
              Replace YOUR CHOSEN APPROACH RATIONALE AND PLAN with your own plan.
              Keep your plan relatively brief, only focusing on important
              information.
              After your plan, choose exactly ONE action from the allowed actions
              list that corresponds to your chosen approach.
              Output no other text.
                   Prompt 9: Prompt comparing alternative approaches and selecting one.
                           10. Efficiency-Driven Planner
              Devise a plan to make progress efficiently.
              What is the most direct path to achieving the next significant step
              or subgoal?
              Outline this efficient path.
              Output your efficiency-focused plan strictly in the following format:
              <plan>YOUR EFFICIENT PLAN</plan>
              Replace YOUR EFFICIENT PLAN with your own plan.
              Keep your plan relatively brief, only focusing on important
              information.
              After your plan, choose exactly ONE action from the allowed actions
              list that represents the first step on this path.
              Output no other text.
                 Prompt 10: Prompt focused on generating the most direct, efficient plan forward.
