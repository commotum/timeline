# Broadcast Channels (1972)
Source: 0f0cbd-1972.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is an information theory treatment of broadcast channels and their achievable transmission rates/capacity regions, not a machine learning model, dataset, or benchmark.
- Its central contribution is theoretical analysis of multi-receiver communication channels, fitting external foundational context rather than ML-specific methods.

## Evidence extracts
- "Abstract-We introduce the problem of a single source attempting to communicate information simultaneously to several receivers." (p. 1)
- "The basic problem is to find the set of simultaneously achievable transmission rates (R,,R,,  * . . ,Rk)." (p. 1)
