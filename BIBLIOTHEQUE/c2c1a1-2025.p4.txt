                      Multimodal machine learning has been widely studied for the development of
                      general intelligence. Recently, the Perceiver and Perceiver IO, show compet-
                      itive results for diverse dataset domains and tasks. However, recent works,
                      Perceiver and Perceiver IO, have focused on heterogeneous modalities, in-
                      cluding image, text, and there are few research works for graph structured
                      datasets. A graph has an adjacency matrix different from other datasets such
                      as text and image, and it is not trivial to handle the topological information.
                      In this study, we provide a Graph Perceiver IO (GPIO), the Perceiver IO
                      for the graph structured dataset. We keep the main structure of the GPIO
                      as the Perceiver IO because the Perceiver IO already handles the diverse
                      dataset well, except for the graph structured dataset. The GPIO is a general
                      method that handles diverse datasets, such as graph-structured data, text,
                      and images, by leveraging positional encoding and output query smooth-
