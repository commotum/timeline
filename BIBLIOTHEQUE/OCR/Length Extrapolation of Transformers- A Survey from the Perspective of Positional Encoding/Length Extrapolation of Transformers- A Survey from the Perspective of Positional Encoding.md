#### **Abstract**

Built upon the Transformer, large language models (LLMs) have captured worldwide attention due to their remarkable abilities. Nevertheless, all Transformer-based models including LLMs suffer from a preset length limit and can hardly generalize from short training sequences to longer inference ones, namely, they cannot perform length extrapolation to handle long sequences, which severely hinders their application in scenarios demanding long input sequences such as legal or scientific documents. Thus, numerous methods have emerged to enhance the length extrapolation of Transformers. Despite the great research efforts, a systematic survey is still lacking. To fill this gap, we delve into these advances in a unified notation from the perspective of positional encoding (PE), as it has been considered the primary factor on length extrapolation. Specifically, we begin with extrapolatable PEs that have dominated this research field. Then, we dive into extrapolation methods based on them, covering position interpolation and randomized position methods. Finally, several challenges and future directions in this area are highlighted. Through this survey, we aim to enable the reader to gain a deep understanding of existing methods and provide stimuli for future research.

### 1 Introduction

It has been suggested that with limited learning resources, humans can potentially comprehend utterances of infinite length by understanding their components and structures (Chomsky, 1957; MONTAGUE, 1970). In natural language processing (NLP), given the limited training data (Kazemnejad et al., 2023) and compute, models cannot learn from large-scale long sequences and thus are also expected to possess such generalization ability to process long sequences (Shaham et al., 2023). However, it is a challenging task for the de facto

Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), though Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023a; OpenAI, 2023) have drastically advanced the NLP field.

Transformer-based models are trained on sequences with a maximum length (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020), as a result of the quadratic memory and computational complexity with regard to input length. To make matters worse, some research reveals that Transformers might have gained their performance from surface-level memorization instead of abstract, generalizable skills (Razeghi et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2024), which means they can hardly break through the maximum training length and perform poorly on sequences with length beyond it (Dai et al., 2019; Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019), i.e., they cannot perform length extrapolation (Mitchell et al., 2018; Press et al., 2021). To offer a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges in length extrapolation, we present comparison results of three state-of-the-art models with different context sizes on several generation tasks in Appendix A.1.

The length limit together with poor length extrapolation prevents LLMs from handling long sequences, such as DNA and protein sequences (Abramson et al., 2024), high-resolution images (Liu et al., 2023a), and even videos (Lin et al., 2023). Moreover, existing approaches for harnessing the full potential of LLMs also demand a larger context window, to incorporate elaborate prompts (Liu et al., 2023c), sufficient in-context demonstrations (Brown et al., 2020) and long-term memory of agents (Park et al., 2023). Hence, there is a growing body of research trying to strengthen length extrapolation of LLMs (Press et al., 2021; Ontanon et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023), mostly from the perspective of positional encoding (PE).

Despite the prosperity in this area, a systematic survey is still lacking. We aim to fill this blank

by investigating existing approaches that enable and enhance length extrapolation of Transformers. Specifically, a brief formal introduction to Transformer is given in §2 as a solid foundation for further discussion. Then, we comprehensively summarize extrapolatable PEs proposed from the birth of Transformer to the prevalence of LLMs in §3. Note that we focus exclusively on PEs proposed for better extrapolation and omit others, since there is already an insightful survey on PEs of Transformer (Dufter et al., 2022). Based on these PEs, many novel methods emerge in the era of LLMs to further enhance extrapolation, which we intentionally centralize in §4, covering popular position interpolation methods and randomized methods. These advancements demonstrate the vibrancy and vastness of this area, from which we distill future directions and insights, represented in §5 and §6.

# 2 Preliminary

In this section, we follow Dufter et al. (2022) to present a formal description of the encoder layer of the Transformer, as the decoder layer is almost the same except for the cross-attention mechanism. Given an input matrix  $\boldsymbol{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$  as a sequence of n embeddings with dimension d, an encoder layer  $f: \mathbb{R}^{n \times d} \to \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$  with  $f(\boldsymbol{X}) = \boldsymbol{Z}$  is defined by:

$$C = \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d}} \tag{1}$$

$$A = \text{Softmax}(C)V \tag{2}$$

$$O = LayerNorm_1(A + X)$$
 (3)

$$F = \text{ReLU}(OW^{(f_1)} + b^{(f_1)})W^{(f_2)} + b^{(f_2)}$$
 (4)

$$Z = \text{LayerNorm}_2(O + F)$$
 (5)

where  $Q = XW_q$ ,  $K = XW_k$ ,  $V = XW_v$  are queries, keys and values, with  $W_q$ ,  $W_k$ ,  $W_v \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  being the projection matrices.

Firstly, the compatibility scores C are computed as the dot product between queries and keys with

a scaling factor  $1/\sqrt{d}$  (Equation 1). Then, the row-wise softmax function converts compatibility scores into weights, and the weighted sum of the values is the output of the attention layer (Equation 2). The fully connected feed-forward network consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation between (Equation 4), with parameters  $\boldsymbol{W}^{(f_1)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_f}, \boldsymbol{W}^{(f_2)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_f \times d}, \boldsymbol{b}^{f(1)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_f}, \boldsymbol{b}^{(f_2)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_f}, \boldsymbol{b}^{(f_2)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_f}$ , where  $d_f$  is the intermediate dimension. Besides, residual connection (He et al., 2016) and layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) are leveraged (Equation 3 and 5) to enhance scalability.

Note that in the above descriptions, we have not imposed any limit on input length n, which means the Transformer is naturally equipped with a notion of length extrapolation. Theoretically, a fixed setting of Transformer weights defines a sequence-to-sequence function on sequences of *arbitrary length* (Yun et al., 2019). If the function applies the correct transformation for inputs of any length, it is expected to length extrapolate (Zhou et al., 2023).

However, we have to break this nature by integrating PE with Transformers to inject position information into them. Otherwise, they are **permutation equivalent** or **order invariant**<sup>2</sup>. Thus, PEs are central to length extrapolation and form the core focus of this survey.

### 3 Extrapolatable Positional Encodings

Sinusoidal position embeddings are proposed with Transformer as it may help extrapolate to longer sequences beyond training (Vaswani et al., 2017). The idea behind this claim, that length extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing PE, has been widely supported and demonstrated (Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019; Press et al., 2021; Ruoss et al., 2023). Hence, developing better PEs has

been the predominant avenue to enhance length extrapolation of Transformers. Table 1 presents a characterization of these extrapolatable PEs.

Basically, absolute positional encodings (APEs) map each position to a unique representation and integrate it with corresponding word embedding, while relative positional encodings (RPEs) encode the relative distance between tokens and directly inject it into the attention module. Besides, RPEs usually keep modifications independent of value vectors and leaves them not entangled with position information. Hence, position information of RPEs can be scalars and usually recurs at each layer. Figure 2 illustrates these general differences. We divide Table 1 and this section based on whether the PE is absolute or relative, as existing research suggests this distinction significantly impacts length extrapolation (Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019; Likhomanenko et al., 2021; Chi et al., 2022).

# 3.1 Absolute Positional Encodings

Specifically, for a token in position *pos*, the sinusoidal position embedding is defined as:

$$[\dots, \sin(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}), \cos(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}), \dots], (6)$$

where  $i \in [0, d/2 - 1]$  is the dimension of the position embedding and d denotes model dimension. Then, each position embedding is added to the corresponding token embedding and the sum

is fed into Transformer, so the compatibility score between query  $q_i$  and key  $k_j$  can be formalized as

$$\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{T} = ((\boldsymbol{x}_{i} + \boldsymbol{p}_{i})\boldsymbol{W}_{q})((\boldsymbol{x}_{j} + \boldsymbol{p}_{j})\boldsymbol{W}_{k})^{T}.$$
 (7)

This equation is the basis of many other PEs.

However, researchers subsequently found that sinusoidal APE is hard to extrapolate (Dai et al., 2019; Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019). Hence, a wide variety of APEs have been proposed to enhance sinusoidal APE and extrapolation of Transformers from different perspectives, either trying to integrate shift invariance in sinusoidal APE (§3.1.1) or aiming to generate position embeddings varying smoothly with position indices (§3.1.2).

# 3.1.1 Integrating Shift Invariance

Taking inspiration from the three properties of PEs proposed by Wang et al. (2020), Kiyono et al. (2021) speculated superior extrapolation performance comes from *shift invariance*, the property of a function to not change its output even if its input is shifted. Aiming to incorporate the benefit of shift invariance in sinusoidal APE, they simply shift every position index of a sequence by a random offset k during training, which prevents the model from using absolute positions and instead encourages the use of relative positions.

Following a similar idea, Likhomanenko et al. (2021) took it a step further by leveraging continuous signals. In addition to shifting every position index of APE by an identical random offset, which they call *global shift*, they also introduced *local shift*, i.e., shifting each position index by a different random shift, and *global scaling*, i.e., scaling every position index by an identical random scalar, to further prevent capturing spontaneous correlations and memorizing distances.

#### 3.1.2 Enhancing Smoothness

Apart from above relatively straightforward methods based on sinusoidal APE, there are several APEs taking quite different theoretical avenues to enhance length extrapolation, aiming to improve the smoothness of the position representations.

Wang et al. (2019) proposed to extend each word embedding as a continuous function over an independent variable, i.e., position, so that word representations vary smoothly with increasing positions. Through mathematically sound derivation, their general complex-valued embedding f(j, pos) of a word  $w_j$  in position pos is

$$[r_{j,1}e^{i(\omega_{j,1}pos+\theta_{j,1})},\cdots,r_{j,d}e^{i(\omega_{j,d}pos+\theta_{j,d})}],$$
 (8)

where amplitude  $\mathbf{r} = [r_{j,1}, \dots, r_{j,d}]$ , frequency  $\boldsymbol{\omega} = [\omega_{j,1}, \dots, \omega_{j,d}]$  and initial phrase  $\boldsymbol{\theta} = [\theta_{j,1}, \dots, \theta_{j,d}]$  are all trainable. In addition to representing positions in complex plane for the first time, multiplying position embeddings with word embeddings is another of their innovations.

An alternative approach is to directly capture the dynamics between position representations. Liu et al. (2020) introduced a dynamical system to model position representations  $\{p_i \in \mathbb{R}^d : i = 1, \ldots, n\}$ , which can be characterized as

$$p(t) = p(s) + \int_{s}^{t} h(\tau, p(\tau); \theta_h) d\tau, 0 \le s \le t < \infty$$
(9)

with an initial vector p(0), where  $p(t) : \mathbb{R}_+ \mapsto \mathbb{R}^d$  is the continuous version of the discrete sequences  $\{p_i\}$ .  $h(\tau, p(\tau); \theta_h)$ , which is the "latent force" that drives the changes from  $p_i$  to  $p_{i+1}$ , is actually a neural network parameterized by  $\theta_h$  and takes in the previous state  $(\tau, p(\tau))$ .

**Highlights:** As the first PE for Transformer, sinusoidal APE has a significant impact on PEs thereafter, despite its poor extrapolation. To improve this, researchers either leverage random shift to incorporate shift invariance in sinusoidal APE or generate position embeddings varying smoothly with position. Among them, simple random shifting is like a small patch for sinusoidal APE and has limited benefits for extrapolation, at the cost of possible semantic confusion in position encoding, while the latter can hopefully lead to better extrapolation, coming with a much higher parameter- and computation-complexity.

#### 3.2 Relative Positional Encodings

Albeit for the efforts in extrapolatable APEs, it is believed that RPEs are theoretically capable of running on unseen lengths and are more robust to input length change (Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019; Likhomanenko et al., 2021; Chi et al., 2022), as RPEs only rely on relative position information, which means they encode the idea of shift invariance naturally and are not subject to a maximum position value. Besides, there is a consensus that in natural language, it is not absolute but relative position that matters (Huang et al., 2020; Sinha et al., 2022). Thus, RPEs become the dominant way to encode positions, which we detail in this section. Before that, we reformulate Equation 7 as follows to clarify the perspective of RPEs:

$$\boldsymbol{q}_i \boldsymbol{k}_i^T = (\boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{W}_q) (\boldsymbol{x}_j \boldsymbol{W}_k)^T \oplus \boldsymbol{p}(j-i), \quad (10)$$

where p(j-i) encodes the relative position information,  $\oplus$  denotes any approach of integrating the position information into the compatibility score.

Among the first, Shaw et al. (2018) introduced the idea of RPE based on above formulation. Specifically, they concretized Equation 10 as

$$\boldsymbol{q}_i \boldsymbol{k}_i^T = (\boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{W}_q) (\boldsymbol{x}_j \boldsymbol{W}_k + \boldsymbol{p}_r)^T, \quad (11)$$

where  $p_r \in \mathbb{R}^d$  is a trainable relative position embedding and  $r = \operatorname{clip}(j-i,r_{\min},r_{\max})$  denotes the clipped relative position. By clipping the relative positions to a determined range, the number of position embeddings to be learned is reduced and length extrapolation is enhanced as unseen position embeddings are avoided. This RPE can also be regarded as a derivation of sinusoidal APE. Following this line, more RPEs have been proposed to better model position information, such as Dai et al. (2019), Huang et al. (2020) and TUPE (Ke et al., 2020). We omit them here since they are not proposed for stronger length extrapolation.

#### 3.2.1 RoPE Family

Also inspired by sinusoidal APE, Su et al. (2024) proposed to multiply keys and queries by rotation matrices, leaving compatibility scores as

$$\mathbf{q}_{i}^{T} \mathbf{k}_{j} = (\mathbf{R}_{\Theta,i}^{d} \mathbf{x}_{i} \mathbf{W}_{q})^{T} (\mathbf{R}_{\Theta,j}^{d} \mathbf{x}_{j} \mathbf{W}_{k})$$
$$= \mathbf{W}_{q}^{T} \mathbf{x}_{i}^{T} \mathbf{R}_{\Theta,j-i}^{d} \mathbf{x}_{j} \mathbf{W}_{k}, \tag{12}$$

where  $\mathbf{R}_{\Theta,j-i}^d = (\mathbf{R}_{\Theta,i}^d)^T \mathbf{R}_{\Theta,j}^d$  with  $\mathbf{R}_{\Theta,i}^d$  being a block-diagonal matrix with rotation matrices

$$\begin{pmatrix} \cos i\theta_m & -\sin i\theta_m \\ \sin i\theta_m & \cos i\theta_m \end{pmatrix} \tag{13}$$

on its diagonal, given the parameters  $\Theta = (\theta_m)_{m=1,2,\dots,d/2}$  where  $\theta_m = 10000^{-2(m-1)/d}$ . Here the *base* is 10000, and  $\lambda_m = 2\pi/\theta_m$  is wavelength. This method is called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) as intuitively it rotates key/value embeddings according to their position index:

$$f_{\{q,k\}}(x_i,i) = \mathbf{R}_{\Theta,i}^d x_i \mathbf{W}_{\{q,k\}}.$$
 (14)

It is noteworthy that despite the absolute nature of this rotary process, the compatibility score and thus attention depend only on relative distance. This property together with long-term decay for intertoken product benefit length extrapolation.

As RoPE has been widely used in popular LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023a; Jiang et al., 2023; Anil et al., 2023), there are some variants proposed to improve it. Sun et al. (2023) defined attention score expectation between two tokens at a specific distance and further attributed the poor extrapolation of RoPE to the dramatic oscillation of their attention expectations. They proposed to fix this issue by incorporating a balancing term to punish the oscillation of unstable dimensions and keep the distribution of stable ones, which can be simplified to:

$$\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{T}\boldsymbol{k}_{j} = \gamma^{i-j}\boldsymbol{W}_{q}^{T}\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{T}\boldsymbol{R}_{\Theta,j-i}^{d}\boldsymbol{x}_{j}\boldsymbol{W}_{k}, \quad (15)$$

where  $\gamma \in (0,1)$  is a scalar hyperparameter.

#### 3.2.2 T5-Bias Family

Different from complex embedding form, some researchers reduce position information p(j-i) to a simpler form. Raffel et al. (2020) utilized learnable scalars to represent relative position information:

$$\boldsymbol{q}_i \boldsymbol{k}_j^T = (\boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{W}_q) (\boldsymbol{x}_j \boldsymbol{W}_k)^T + \beta_{i,j}.$$
 (16)

In addition, they extended the clipping mechanism by a logarithmic bucket assignment to achieve precise discrimination of nearby positions and less precise discrimination of further positions (e.g., mapping the position indices 1-4 to themselves, 5-6 to 5, 7-8 to 6, 9-12 to 7, and so forth.), which further reduces the parameters to be learned and is beneficial for extrapolation (Chi et al., 2022). Moreover, Wennberg and Henter (2021) introduced TISE, which leverages a radial-basis function of relative distance with multiple trainable parameters to add a bias to attention scores.

As the first PE aiming mainly for length extrapolation, ALiBi (Press et al., 2021) takes an even simpler way to represent relative position:

$$\boldsymbol{q}_i \boldsymbol{k}_j^T = (\boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{W}_q) (\boldsymbol{x}_j \boldsymbol{W}_k)^T + m(j-i), \quad (17)$$

where scalar m is a head-specific slope fixed before training. It is worth noting that there is no additional learnable parameter, which leads to superior efficiency and may also contribute to better extrapolation of ALiBi. Empirical experiments on language modeling demonstrated its superiority.

From the perspective of kernel methods, Chi et al. (2022) considered ALiBi as a triangle kernel and extended it to KERPLE, a framework that generalizes relative position embeddings for extrapolation by kernelizing positional differences using conditionally positive definite kernels. In this framework, various RPEs can be derived from different conditionally positive definite kernels in a principled way, among which the logarithmic variant achieves preferred extrapolation performance, by calculating the compatibility score as follows:

$$\boldsymbol{q}_i^T \boldsymbol{k}_j = (\boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{W}_q)^T (\boldsymbol{x}_j \boldsymbol{W}_k) - r_1 \cdot \log(1 + r_2|i - j|),$$
(18)

where  $r_1, r_2$  are positive scalar parameters.

Aware of the overfitting issue of sinusoidal APE, Chi et al. (2023b) proposed to overcome it by simplifying sinusoidal APE to a new RPE, Sandwich. Specifically, they dropped the cross terms in Equation 7 and kept the inner product of two position embeddings as position information:

$$\boldsymbol{q}_i^T \boldsymbol{k}_j = (\boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{w}_q)^T (\boldsymbol{x}_j \boldsymbol{W}_k) + \boldsymbol{p}_i^T \boldsymbol{p}_i.$$
 (19)

It is worth noting that in this formula,  $p_i^T p_j$  becomes a temporal bias term with the same decaywith-distance pattern as ALiBi, which is exactly what the authors want to achieve as they suggested this pattern is likely to be the secret to successful length extrapolation. Besides, since position embeddings here only need to interact with themselves, the authors make the dimension of them a hyperparameter to further improve performance.

FIRE (Li et al., 2023b) integrates positional information into Transformers following T5 bias:

$$\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{T} = (\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\boldsymbol{W}_{q})(\boldsymbol{x}_{j}\boldsymbol{W}_{k})^{T} + b(i,j), \quad (20)$$

where the bias b(i,j) is mapped from positions using a learnable continuous function  $f_{\theta}: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ , e.g., MLP. To avoid the generalization issue when the inputs are outside the training domain of the function, they proposed progressive interpolation by normalizing the distance by query position index, namely  $b(i,j) = f_{\theta}(\frac{i-j}{i})$ . Note that in causal attention, the normalized distance is always bounded between [0,1], which aligns the inference

domain with the training domain for any sequence lengths, leading to better length extrapolation.

However, the above methods separate positional bias from semantics completely, which may cause semantic similarity to be overshadowed by position information. Hence, Zheng et al. (2024) proposed Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) to integrate both semantic and positional information:

$$\begin{aligned} \boldsymbol{q}_i \boldsymbol{k_j}^T &= (\boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{W}_q) (\boldsymbol{x}_j \boldsymbol{W}_k)^T \\ &+ f((\boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{W}_q) (\boldsymbol{x}_j \boldsymbol{W}_k)^T, b(i, j)). \end{aligned} \tag{21}$$

Here  $f: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$  is parameterized by a two-layer LeakyReLU neural network and b(i, j) come from other RPEs(e.g., ALiBi and FIRE).

In addition to RPEs introduced previously, there are some methods cannot be categorized into RoPE or T5-bias family. He et al. (2024) introduce bilevel PE that employs two distinct PE for each position: an APE for intra-segment position to help model capture the semantics contained therein, while an RPE for inter-segment position to capture relationships between segments and exhibits extrapolation. This decoupling offers greater flexibility in addressing the length extrapolation problem.

Based on the observation that existing PEs use token as the unit of measurement, Golovneva et al. (2024) claimed that this feature prevents PEs from generalizing to higher levels of abstraction such as sentences and paragraphs. Therefore, they proposed Contextual Positional Encoding (CoPE), which allows the model to determine semantic unit (e.g., word and sentence) and assign tokens therein a same position index. Since CoPE can distribute positions to a much larger number of tokens and focus attention on semantic units at a higher level of abstraction, it exhibits stronger extrapolation.

Highlights: Earlier RPEs had been greatly influenced by sinusoidal APEs by modifying terms in Equation 7 and replacing absolute embeddings with relative embeddings. These methods usually leverage clipping or binning strategy to avoid out-of-distribution position embeddings and enhance extrapolation. Since RPEs decouple the one-to-one correspondence between position and position representation, incorporating bias term directly into compatibility score (Equation 10) becomes a feasible and even better way to encode positional information, which is much simpler and naturally disentangles value vectors and position information. However, despite the strong extrapolation of these bias methods, they cannot represent complex

distance-attention functions based on Fourier basis like RoPE. Therefore, RoPE become the de facto PE of recent LLMs due to its advanced general performance, in spite of its poor extrapolation.

# 4 Extrapolation Methods in LLMs Era

Based on PEs in §3, various methods have been developed to further enhance length extrapolation of LLMs. This section is separated in response to this wave, focusing on interpolation methods and randomized PEs, as illustrated in Figure 3.

#### 4.1 Position Interpolation

Despite the large quantity of PEs with better extrapolation, RoPE has been most widely adopted in recent LLMs due to its superior in-distribution performance. Hence, loads of methods have been proposed to enhance the extrapolation of RoPE, the most prevalent of which is position interpolation.

Chen et al. (2023b) firstly  $^3$  introduced position interpolation for RoPE to extrapolate LLMs to longer sequences by applying linear scaling to down-scale position indices so that the maximum position index matches the previous length limit during pre-training. Formally, this method replaces RoPE f (Equation 14) by f' defined as  $f'(\boldsymbol{x},i) = f(\boldsymbol{x},\frac{iL}{L'})$ , where L is the length limit during pre-training and L' is the longer sequence length at inference. The *scale ratio*  $\kappa = L'/L$  transforms position n to  $n/\kappa$ . This method reduces absolute position indices from [0,L') to [0,L) and maximum relative distance from L' to L, aligning the ranges of position indices and relative distances to mitigate effects on attention score computation.

However, from the perspective of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory (Jacot et al., 2018), simply interpolating RoPE's Fourier space linearly will cause the loss of high-frequency information and prevent models from distinguishing nearby positions. Hence, NTK-Aware Scaled RoPE (NTK-aware interpolation) (bloc97, 2023b) has been proposed by modifying the base of RoPE:

$$\theta_m^* = (b \cdot \kappa^{\frac{d}{d-2}})^{-2(m-1)/d},$$
 (22)

where b is the original base and  $\kappa$  is still the scale ratio. The core idea here is to scale high frequencies less and low frequencies more to reduce information loss of high frequencies. As NTK-aware interpolation does not scale the Fourier features

Figure 3: Essentials of position interpolation and randomized PE. Randomized PE aims to ensure that positions falling outside the context window at inference remain in distribution through advanced exposure in training. Position interpolation, on the other hand, works during the inference stage by scaling a longer position range into the original context window.

directly, all positions are distinguishable from each other. Moreover, this method does not require any fine-tuning to extend the context window.

Further, Dynamic-NTK interpolation (emozilla, 2023) combined NTK-aware interpolation with dynamic scaling, using exact positions for tokens within pre-trained context window to prevent performance degradation and dynamically increases scale ratio  $\kappa$  as current sequence length increases to adjust positions beyond the window:

$$\kappa = \begin{cases} L'/L, & \text{if } L'/L > 1, \\ 1, & \text{otherwise,} \end{cases}$$
 (23)

where L' is the sequence length of the current sequence, which will increase after each step.

Either scaling position indices or modifying bases, all position representations become closer to each other, impairing LLM's ability to distinguish the positional order of close-by tokens. Besides, bloc97 (2023a) observed that some RoPE dimensions have wavelengths longer than the pre-trained context window, where they presume absolute positional information remains intact<sup>4</sup>. Hence, they proposed NTK-by-parts, which does not interpo-

late dimensions of small wavelengths at all while always interpolating those of big ones.

Similar observations with NTK-by-parts have been made by Pal et al. (2023), based on which they proposed to use the truncated basis:

$$\theta_i^* = \begin{cases} \theta_i & \text{for } \theta_i \ge b, \\ \rho & \text{for } a < \theta_i < b, \\ 0 & \text{for } \theta_i < a. \end{cases}$$
 (24)

where  $\rho$  is a fixed value that is relatively small, and a and b are chosen cutoff values. This way, models will experience all values of the basis in the context length used during fine-tuning by choosing appropriate cutoff values, and are supposed to extrapolate better during inference.

Additionally, Peng et al. (2023b) observed that by introducing a temperature t into compatibility score before Softmax, perplexity decreases consistently. Combining this finding with NTK-by-parts interpolation, they subsequently proposed YaRN that surpasses previous interpolation methods in both fine-tuned and non-fine-tuned scenarios.

The interpolation methods reflect the critical impact of the rotary base of RoPE on length extrapolation, prompting efforts to enhance extrapolation of RoPE-based LLM by fine-tuning it with a scaled base (Xiong et al., 2023; Rozière et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023d). However, fixed scaling factors overlook the gradual length-extension process and impair performance at shorter lengths, leading to the proposal of dynamic scaling methods (Chen et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2024b; Ding et al., 2024). Innovatively, Wang et al. (2024) scale each dimension's base by rounding its wavelength to the nearest integer, avoiding phase shifts after each full rotation.

**Highlights:** Recently, position interpolation methods have raised widespread interest in the research community, as a natural result of their superior extrapolation performance and extremely low overhead. Current interpolation methods either interpolate position indices or RoPE's base, guided by sound theoretical intuition. Besides, different from other extrapolation methods, position interpolation methods have already seen their presence in the open-source models (Bai et al., 2023a; Touvron et al., 2023b; AI et al., 2024).

#### 4.2 Randomized Positional Encoding

For PEs without clipping mechanism, length extrapolation means positions beyond those that have

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>4</sup>From the perspective of frequency, the full range of high-frequency components have been seen by the model during training, while low-frequency components have not. Thus, every position within the context window leads to a unique value in these low-frequency components, based on which models can determine the absolute position of each token.

been observed during training, leading to out-ofdistribution position representations and thus performance degradation. To address this, an intuitive way is enabling models to observe all possible position representations during training, which is exactly the core idea behind randomized PEs.

As a realization of this idea, Ruoss et al. (2023) proposed to simulate a much longer range of positions (M) and randomly selects an ordered subset to fit the training context window for each iteration. Thus, through adequate training, we can ensure that the model encounters enough unique positions and all M positions have been fully trained, leading to consistent extrapolation performance.

Different from Ruoss et al. (2023), PoSE (Zhu et al., 2023) partitions a sequence into chunks and adjusts the position indices by adding distinct skipping bias terms between chunks. Hence, PoSE keeps the positions continuous in each chunk, which bears a close resemblance to pre-training, while simultaneously help the model adapt to all positions within a longer context window.

Highlights: Essentially, randomized PEs simply decouple the trained context window with the longer inference one by introducing randomized positions during training or fine-tuning, boosting exposure of all possible positions in advance. This idea is quite different from that of position interpolation methods, where the latter tries to interpolate positions during inference to make them fall into the trained range. For the same reason, position interpolation methods are mostly plug-and-play while randomized PEs usually need further fine-tuning, which makes position interpolation much more appealing due to its low overhead.

#### **5** Future Directions

Evaluation and Benchmark. Initially, researchers evaluated length extrapolation by training models on sequences with a length limit and testing them on slightly longer sequences (Liu et al., 2020; Likhomanenko et al., 2021). During this phase, evaluation samples and metrics came from various downstream tasks such as machine translation and question answering. Given the demonstrated versatility of pre-trained language models in various downstream tasks (Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020), language modeling and perplexity have emerged as the standard metrics for evaluating length extrapolation (Press et al., 2021; Haviv et al., 2022). Thus, we statistically present some

empirical results of trending PEs on language modeling in Appendix A.2. However, it has become clear that perplexity alone does not adequately reflect downstream task performance and is insufficient (Tay et al., 2021; Kazemnejad et al., 2023; Pal et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024). Therefore, dedicated benchmarks and evaluation methods are needed to further advance the field of length extrapolation.

To stimulate subsequent research, we present several preliminary thoughts on the construction of a standardized benchmark in Appendix A.3.

Explainability and Principle. Despite the remarkable progress, our understanding of length extrapolation remains limited, lacking a general and solid theoretical foundation. The decayingwith-distance pattern was initially thought to be crucial for extrapolatable PEs (Press et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024), but it was later shown to merely accommodate the recency bias of language modeling (Chi et al., 2023c). Although Qin et al. (2024) further provided a theoretical analysis and elaborated that exponential convergence is a sufficient condition for RPEs to length extrapolate, their definition of length extrapolation is also based on language modeling and perplexity, which may limit the applicability of their theorem. Besides, extrapolation methods tend to avoid out-of-distribution positions via interpolation or advanced exposure. Thus, it remains unclear when or if Transformers length extrapolate in real-world scenarios and whether or how existing methods help with it.

Long Context Utilization. Existing length extrapolation methods mostly focus on expanding context window of Transformers, while much less attention has been paid to the investigation and optimization of the utilization of long context. In fact, as a result of recent advances, state-of-the-art LLMs are claimed to be capable of processing sequences with up to 128k tokens (Abdin et al., 2024; AI, 2024). Given such a long context, the extent to which the models can effectively utilize it becomes a critical question. Previous study has revealed that LLMs tend to "lost in the middle" (Liu et al., 2023b), i.e., they cannot effectively leverage information in the middle of a long context. Despite a few preliminary explorations trying to improve long context utilization (Staniszewski et al., 2023; Ravaut et al., 2024), recent long-context benchmarks (Li et al., 2023a; An et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a) suggest that trending long-context LLMs still struggle on long sequences, and significant advancements are required.

# 6 Discussions

# 6.1 Length-Extrapolated and Long-Context Transformers

Throughout this survey, we position length extrapolation as a promising avenue towards long-context transformers. However, as stated in §1, it's the length limit and poor length extrapolation together that prevents transformers from processing long sequences, thus the more direct way to extend the context window is to simply relax the length limit.

The most intuitive way to achieve large context window is directly pre-training the model or fine-tuning (continual pre-training) a pre-trained model on long sequences. Xiong et al. (2023) empirically demonstrated that long context continual pre-training is more efficient and similarly effective compared to pre-training from scratch with long sequences. However, both pre-training and fine-tuning (continual pre-training) are costly and demand large-scale high-quality long data, which is scarce (Kazemnejad et al., 2023). To reduce memory and computational overhead during training, recurrent Transformer variances integrate recurrence with attention (Dai et al., 2019; Bulatov et al., 2022) while efficient Transformer variants (Tay et al., 2022; Fournier et al., 2023) mainly aim at improving the quadratic complexity of attention mechanism, but both usually compromise some of the modeling capability and still need large-scale long sequence data. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) greatly improves both training and inference efficiency of Transformers with little to no overhead, leading to models with much larger context window (Jiang et al., 2023; Gunasekar et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a).

On the other side, there are more radical research efforts that attempt to abandon attention and its quadratic complexity with regard to sequence length completely, such as S4 (Gu et al., 2022), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023a), and Hyena (Poli et al., 2023). Further, some recent studies have attempted to scale these novel architectures to billions of parameters, leading to the emergence of Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023) and RWKV-5/6 (Peng et al., 2024). However, it has been demonstrated that Transformer models perform dramatically better than state space models like S4 at copying and retrieving information from context (Jelassi et al., 2024). Thus, whether these novel architectures are better than Transformer and how they perform on real-world scenarios remains to be evaluated.

#### 6.2 Length Extrapolation and Generalization

In parallel to research efforts that deem length extrapolation as a promising approach to extend context window of LLMs, another line of research treats it as a generalization problem and analyzes the length generalization behavior of Transformers within small context window on synthetic tasks such as arithmetic and deductive reasoning in a controlled setup (Lake and Baroni, 2018; Dubois et al., 2020; Abbe et al., 2023), where some intriguing observations and insights have been discovered.

One common observation is that Transformers often struggle with length generalization, whether they are trained from scratch on synthetic tasks (Lee et al., 2023; Kazemnejad et al., 2023), fine-tuned from pre-trained LLMs (Anil et al., 2022) or tested in in-context learning (Saparov et al., 2023).

As explanations, Dziri et al. (2023) hypothesize certain tasks may not possess the inherent compositionality and allow for shortcut pattern matching. On the other side, Transformers are proven to length generalize on specific tasks (Zhou et al., 2023; Xiao and Liu, 2024) or with the right combination of data format and PE (Zhou et al., 2024). Meanwhile, some studies show other factors in length generalization. Anil et al. (2022) find that fine-tuning regime, scaling data, model sizes, and compute does not improve length generalization, while scratchpad (Nye et al., 2022) or chain-ofthought (Wei et al., 2022) in the in-context learning regime do. In addition, Kazemnejad et al. (2023) show that explicit PE is not essential for decoderonly Transformer to length generalize on smallscale synthetic tasks. These studies have deepened our understanding of length extrapolation in a mechanistic way and broadened our perspectives to go beyond PE, demonstrating that the extrapolation ability needs a systematic design where PE is crucial but by no means the sole component.

#### 7 Conclusion

Through this survey, we systematically summarized existing methods and recent advances in length extrapolation from the perspective of PE. Specifically, we meticulously categorize extrapolatable PEs and further dive into methods based on these PEs in LLMs era. In addition, we highlight existing challenges and identify new trends in this research field, hoping to facilitate researchers and provide stimuli for future research.

# Limitation

This survey presented a systematic review of existing methods and recent trends in length extrapolation of Transformers. However, due to the lack of standardized benchmark and evaluation methods, we primarily focus on high-level comparisons and distinctions in principle of different approaches, rather than fine-grained empirical analysis. Furthermore, in this work, we focus on length extrapolation studies aimed at extending the context window of LLMs in real-world scenarios. Although we acknowledge the importance of studies analyzing length generalization in synthetic tasks within a small context window as well, we provide only a brief discussion on them due to the page limitation.

# A Appendix

# A.1 Length Extrapolation on Generation Tasks

To help readers gain a deeper understanding of the challenges of length extrapolation, we leverage LongBench-E (Bai et al., 2023b) as our testbed and choose three trending LLMs with different context window sizes to evaluate their performance on various generation tasks and different evaluation length ranges. The results are shown in Table 2.

From the results, some intriguing conclusions can be drawn:

- 1. When evaluating models on sequences beyond the original context window, a consistent performance degradation can be observed across models and tasks, which strongly supports the necessity of studying length extrapolation.
- 2. Thanks to the shift-invariance and decay-with-distance property of RPE these LLMs use, they can maintain a reasonable performance when dealing with sequences beyond the context window, i.e., the performance will gradually decline rather than immediately crush after length exceeding the context window.
- 3. Even evaluating on sequences within the context window, the increase in sequence length still leads to degraded performance. This may be as a result of the increasing difficulty with increasing length or due to the sparsity of long-range dependencies in concatenated training long sequences, meaning length extrapolation as a problem even exists within training context window and long-context transformers trained on long sequences do not necessarily possess strong length extrapolation capability.

# A.2 Results on Language Modeling

To offer an empirical comparison between popular PEs, we statistically collect results from published literatures and form Table 3.

We highlight several important conclusions from these results:

• RPEs demonstrate better in-distribution performance. On sequences with length within context window, RPEs already demonstrate better performance, compared to APEs. We explain the results as RPE is consistent with the nature of natural language (relative

position matters rather than absolute positions).

- RPEs demonstrate better extrapolation capability. In the length extrapolation setting that this survey concerns most, RPEs also outperform APEs due to intrinsic shift-invariance and binning strategy (for T5 bias) or exponentially decay with distance (for ALiBi and RoPE).
- · RPEs seek a balance between expressiveness (embedding-based RPE) and extrapolation (bias-based RPE) and perplexity is in**sufficient.** As in comparisons between RPEs, we can see that bias methods (T5 bias and ALiBi) lead to lower perplexity on sequences with length both within and beyond the context window, which indicates bias methods are better at language modeling by explicitly pandering recency bias. Note that it does not mean our claim that embedding-based methods like RoPE are more expressive is wrong, considering that models with ALiBi have worse performance than RoPE-based models on current trending benchmarks (Pal et al., 2023) like MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and LMSys arena (Zheng et al., 2023). This further shows that perplexity is insufficient to reflect performance in these downstream tasks.

### A.3 Thoughts on Standardized Benchmark

Realizing the difficulty and complexity of constructing a standardized benchmark for length extrapolation, we present some preliminary thoughts on it as follows:

- The benchmark should have no position bias.
   This means the model cannot consistently rely on tokens at specific locations to reach the correct answer. Thus, language modeling is not an ideal task due to its recency bias, which makes it possible for the model to generate the correct token based solely on nearby tokens.
- The benchmark should require **modeling the full range**. This indicates the model cannot depend on a small portion of the input but needs to attend and model the full range of context to give correct responses. Thus, the popular Needle In A Haystack test (gkamradt, 2024) is not an ideal benchmark, as it

Table 3: Empirical comparisons of different PEs on language modeling. The results on WikiText-103 are obtained from Sun et al. (2023) and the results on OpenWebText2 and ArXiv are obtained from Chi (2024). Note that the results may not be fairly comparable across dataset due to differences in model and training.

only requires the model to search and retrieve only a small portion of the input that is significantly different from other content, which is quite different from understanding and use of context (Liu et al., 2023b).

• This benchmark should offer **flexibility in sequence length with relatively stable difficulty**. This means the benchmark should consist of enough sequences at increasing lengths but not increasing difficulty. Thus, the benchmark can directly help with the fine-grained evaluation of the length extrapolation capability of Transformers without the need to crop a complete sequence, where the consistency of difficulty ensures the evaluation is only relevant to the increasing length.

As for a concrete example, calculating long sequences containing only addition and subtraction within ten (and keeping the intermediate results in a small range) might be a promising evaluation task, considering that the task itself is simple enough for common LLMs (Li et al., 2024) and we can thus focus on the impact of increasing length.
