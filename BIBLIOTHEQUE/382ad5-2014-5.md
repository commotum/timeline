# Generative Adversarial Nets (2014)
Source: 382ad5-2014.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces an adversarial framework where a generative model is pitted against a discriminative adversary to distinguish model versus data distributions.
- Defines the "adversarial nets" special case and trains both models with backpropagation and forward propagation.

## Evidence extracts
- "In the proposed adversarial nets framework, the generative model is pitted against an adversary: a
  discriminative model that learns to determine whether a sample is from the model distribution or the
  data distribution." (p. 1)
- "We refer to this special case as adversarial nets. In this case, we can train
  both models using only the highly successful backpropagation and dropout algorithms [17] and
  sample from the generative model using only forward propagation." (p. 2)
