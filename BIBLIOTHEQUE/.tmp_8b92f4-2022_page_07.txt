                    346      Figure 5: Improvement in percentage of solved test instances per task. (a) From ViT-Vanilla
                    347      to ViTARC-VT: We observe that over 85% of tasks benefit from the introduction of 2D Visual
                    348      Tokens, showing consistent gains compared to the vanilla ViT. (b) From ViTARC-VT to ViTARC:
                    349      We observe that more than half of all tasks show further improvement. Improvement from ViT-
                    350      Vanilla to ViTARC is shown in Figure 9 in Appendix C.1 where a 57.36% average improvement is
                    351      observed.

                    353      4.1   RESULTS
                    354
                    355      Figure 3 shows substantial improvements in test accuracy due to the 2D visual tokens just de-
                    356      scribed. Figure 5(a) illustrates the improvement in the percentage of solved instances for each task.
                    357      Weobserve an average performance boost of 48.34% compared to the baseline ViT across the 400
                    358      tasks. This model, referred to as ViTARC-VT, demonstrates that the new representation with 2D
                    359      visual tokens significantly enhances the model’s ability to handle AVR tasks.
                    360      Akey driver of this improvement is the use of 2D padding, which creates a fixed schema for 2D
                    361      positions. This ensures consistent spatial alignment and effectively addresses the challenge of ap-
                    362      plying 2DAPEtovariable-sizedgrids, where unknownoutputpositionsduringinference complicate
                    363      accurate mapping.
                    364
                    365      Toquantify the contribution of border tokens, we performed an ablation study. As seen in Figure 7,
                    366      the absence of border tokens leads to a 4.59% decrease in accuracy, emphasizing their importance
                    367      in helping the model delineate task grid boundaries and maintain spatial consistency in the input
                    368      representation. For more detailed numerical results, refer to Table 6 in Appendix C.2.

                    371
                    372      While ViTARC-VT delivers strong results—approximately 40% of ARC tasks achieved over 90%
                    373      solved test instances—there remain certain tasks where the model struggles. Specifically, around
                    374      10%ofARCtaskshavelessthan 5% of test instances solved, even after training on a large dataset
                    375      containing one million examples per task. Closer examination reveals that tasks involving complex
                    376      visual structures, such as concave shapes, holes, or subgrids, are consistently problematic. These
                    377      challenges highlight certain architectural limitations, particularly the model’s difficulty in segment-
                             ing multi-colored objects, where positional information should ideally play a more dominant role.
