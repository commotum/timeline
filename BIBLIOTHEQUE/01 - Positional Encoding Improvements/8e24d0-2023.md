# A Length-Extrapolatable Transformer (2023)
Source: 8e24d0-2023.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper critiques existing positional embeddings for poor length extrapolation and proposes a new relative positional embedding (XPOS) to improve position handling.
- The central contribution is a positional encoding modification (extrapolatable position embedding) aimed at improving attention resolution and extrapolation.

## Evidence extracts
- "Among many relative position embeddings, ROPE (Su et al., 2021) shows better performance and is used to many PLMs such as PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022). However, it can’t deal with sequences with exceeding length. Alibi (Press et al., 2021) mitigates the extrapolation problem but sacrifices the general performance." (p. 1)
- "Considering all the properties above, we propose Extrapolatable Position Embedding (XPOS), which is a universal-good design for Transformers." (p. 2)
