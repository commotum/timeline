# HiRoPE: Length Extrapolation for Code Models Using Hierarchical Position (2024)
Source: a494fd-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a hierarchical variant of RoPE, modifying positional encoding to improve length extrapolation for code models.
- Critiques traditional positional encoding as token-count-based and treating code as plain text, motivating a new positional encoding.

## Evidence extracts
- "We expand the traditional RoPE method into a hierarchical format
  and prove the effectiveness of our HiRoPE through
  theoretical derivations and practical experiments." (Section 6.2)
- "Traditional positional
  encoding uses token counts for positioning, and
  treats code as plain text." (Introduction)
