# Mesa-Extrapolation: A Weave Position Encoding Method for Enhanced Extrapolation in LLMs (2024)
Source: a8b17a-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a novel weave-PE-based method (Mesa-Extrapolation) to improve extrapolation, making positional encoding changes the central contribution.
- Analyzes failures of existing positional encoding choices such as NoPE, framing a limitation that the new weave PE addresses.

## Evidence extracts
- "a theoretical analysis to better understand why No Position Encoding (NoPE) fails" (p. 1)
- "Wefurther introduce a novel weave-PE-based method, Mesa-Extrapolation, which demonstrates" (p. 2)
- "Based on Equ.1 we formally define weave PE as follows:" (p. 3)
