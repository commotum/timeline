Figure 18.14 Sites in striate cortex injected with tritiated amino acids. Injection sites
(shown in black) are numbered according to the eccentricity of their representation in the
visual field. These representations ranged from less than one-half degree from fixation
(site 1) to greater than 45° from fixation (site 10). Each injection was made in a separate
hemisphere. Dashed lines indicate extent of striate cortex on cross-sections, but borders
of striate cortex on surface views; anterior limit of striate cortex within the calcarine fis-
sure is indicated on medial surface view by a dashed arrow. Negative numerals indicate
approximate A-P stereotaxic levels. For abbreviations see figure 18.3.
