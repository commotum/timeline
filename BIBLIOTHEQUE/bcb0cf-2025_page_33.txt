                  G.1  MEMORYANDSPEEDCONSIDERATIONS
                  Contrary to traditional fixed-depth models, the MIND model introduces an adaptive computation framework,
                  which has variable memory and computational requirements based on input complexity. The use of Fixed-
                  Point Iteration (FPI) layers, while enhancing flexibility and accuracy, also impacts memory consumption and
                  computational speed.
                  The memory requirements for the MIND model depend on the depth and complexity of the inputs. FPI
                  layers require additional memory to store intermediate states across iterations. This dynamic nature results in
                  higher memory usage compared to standard layers, particularly for high-dimensional data. Despite this, the
                  parameter efficiency of the MIND model (5.01M / 0.3M / 5.31M for Prediction / Introspection / Total) helps
                  mitigate the overall memory footprint.
                  While the FPI layers add to the computational load, the operations can be parallelized on GPUs. This
                  parallelization helps manage the wall clock time, although the computations remain computationally intensive.
                  Theintrospection network, by selectively activating layers, also contributes to efficient memory utilization by
                  preventing unnecessary computations.
                  As future work, we aim to develop optimized CUDA implementations to enhance memory and speed

                  Overall, while the MIND model trades off memory capacity against computational complexity, its design
                  allows for efficient utilization of resources, making it suitable for various applications, including those
                  requiring adaptive computation.
                  H LIMITATIONS
                  TheMINDmodeldemonstratessignificant advantages in computational efficiency and accuracy, but several
                  limitations remain. First, the integration of the introspection network and Fixed-Point Iteration (FPI) layers
                  increases the complexity of the training process. These components introduce sensitivities to hyperparameters
                  andtrainingdynamics,particularlyindeepernetworks,whichcanleadtogradientinstability. Thisnecessitates
                  careful tuning and robust optimization techniques, which may not always generalize across different tasks
                  or datasets. Second, the sequential nature of the introspection network introduces computational overhead,
                  particularly in highly parallelized environments such as TPUs or large-scale distributed systems. This
                  limitation can hinder scalability and efficiency in such contexts. Third, while the current introspection
                  mechanism performs well in structured environments, it may struggle with unstructured data where input
                  complexityisnoteasilyquantifiable. This limits its applicability in domains with ambiguous or heterogeneous
                  data characteristics. Finally, MIND’s adaptive nature introduces variability in inference times, posing
                  challenges for applications requiring strict real-time performance. This variability complicates deployment in
                  latency-sensitive systems and requires further investigation.
                  I  FUTURE WORK
                  Toaddress these limitations and extend the applicability of MIND, we are actively pursuing several research
                  directions. To overcome the sequential overhead of the introspection network, we are investigating methods
                  to parallelize certain aspects of its computation while maintaining its adaptive capabilities. For example,
                  designing parallelizable architectures could improve performance on distributed systems without sacrificing
                  functionality. Additionally, we aim to enhance MIND’s generalization across diverse domains by developing
                  morerobust metrics for quantifying input complexity. These metrics will enable MIND to adapt dynamically
                  even in unstructured or ambiguous data environments, broadening its applicability across tasks. To address
                  inference variability, we are designing mechanisms for predicting and controlling latency during dynamic
                  computation paths. This includes integrating real-time monitoring tools that ensure consistent performance
                  in latency-sensitive applications. Finally, future work will focus on deploying MIND in diverse real-world
                  scenarios such as autonomous systems, healthcare diagnostics, and large-scale recommendation systems
                  to test its adaptability under practical constraints. By addressing these areas, we aim to enhance MIND’s
