# VECTOR SYMBOLIC ALGEBRAS FOR THE ABSTRACTION AND REASONING CORPUS (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: d54652-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper presents a neurosymbolic ARC-AGI solver as its main contribution.
- The solver uses a heuristic-guided search process and a neurosymbolic learning architecture, indicating a computation and reasoning mechanism focus.

## Evidence extracts
- "We presented a novel, neurosymbolic, cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver." (Section 6 Conclusion)
- "Oursolvergeneratessolutionswithaheuristic-guidedsearchprocessandaneurosymboliclearningarchitecture." (Section 5 Discussion)
