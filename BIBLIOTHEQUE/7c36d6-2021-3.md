# Latent Execution for Neural Program Synthesis (2021)
Source: 7c36d6-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes LaSynth with a latent execution trace that models hypothetical inputs for partial program execution, changing how the model reasons about incomplete programs.
- Introduces a latent executor mechanism to guide program decoding without requiring explicit execution traces or interpreters.

## Evidence extracts
- "representation, named Latent Execution Trace (LaET), models the hypothetical input signal for the remaining partial program to execute to get to the desired output." (p. 2)
- "for Karel program synthesis [12, 44, 47], in this paper, we introduce latent executor (Fig. 2(c))" (p. 4)
