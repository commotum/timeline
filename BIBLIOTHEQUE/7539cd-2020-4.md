# LogiQA: A Challenge Dataset for Machine Reading Comprehension with Logical Reasoning (2020)
Source: 7539cd-2020.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper's main contribution is a new logical reasoning reading comprehension dataset (LogiQA), not a model or mechanism.
- It explicitly frames LogiQA as a benchmark for evaluating logical reasoning in machine reading.

## Evidence extracts
- "We have presented LogiQA, a large-scale logical reasoning
reading comprehension dataset." (Conclusion)
- "Our dataset can also serve as a benchmark for re-
investigating logical AI under the deep learning
NLP setting." (Abstract)
