# ARC Is a Vision Problem! (2025)
Source: ba30e0-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Frames ARC as a vision-centric, image-to-image translation task, emphasizing 2D visual modeling.
- Uses a Vision Transformer as the core architecture, indicating a transformer adapted to spatial patches.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this work, we
formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an
image-to-image translation problem." (p. 1)
- "The principle of ViT is Transformer on patches." (p. 4)

## Classification
