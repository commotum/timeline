           among current methods, as shown in Table 3. The comparative results    the experiment, where wall, beam, bookcase, board, door, column are
           with 10 algorithms are shown in Fig. 18, highlighting our superiority  selected for comparison. We compared our method with the graph
           in both OA and mIoU. We also calculated the IoU for each class in      learning and Transformer algorithms, and the results indicate that our
