# The hippocampus as a spatial map. Preliminary evidence from unit activity in the freely-moving rat (1971)
Source: 0ee181-1971.pdf

## Core reasons
- Neuroscience study of hippocampal unit activity in rats, providing biological context rather than ML methods or datasets.
- Frames hippocampus as providing a spatial map, offering conceptual grounding relevant to cognition rather than a machine learning contribution.

## Evidence extracts
- "These deficits could be due to the loss of the neural system which provides the animal with a cognitive, or spatial, map of its environment." (p. 171)
- "It is the response properties of the last class of units which has led us to postulate that the rat hippocampus functions as a spatial map." (p. 172)
