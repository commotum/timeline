                Coarse-to-fine 3D instance segmentation methods show
             weak performances compared to recent Grouping-based,
             Kernel-based and Transformer-based methods. We argue
             that this is due to two limitations: 1) Instance size over-
             estimation by axis-aligned bounding box(AABB) 2) False
             negative error accumulation from inaccurate box to the re-
             finement phase. In this work, we introduce Spherical Mask,
             a novel coarse-to-fine approach based on spherical repre-
             sentation, overcoming those two limitations with several
             benefits. Specifically, our coarse detection estimates each in-
             stance with a 3D polygon using a center and radial distance
             predictions, which avoids excessive size estimation of AABB.      Figure 1. Pipeline of Spherical Mask with coarse-to-fine frame-

             existing works, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new in-    three approaches, the coarse-to-fine approach has received
