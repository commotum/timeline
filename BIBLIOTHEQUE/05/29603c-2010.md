# Relative Entropy Policy Search (2010)
Source: 29603c-2010.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a new reinforcement learning policy-search method (REPS) that changes the optimization approach via an information-loss constraint, which is a methodological contribution in ML rather than positional encoding or transformer dimensionality.
- Focuses on reinforcement learning algorithm design and evaluation, not on creating a dataset/benchmark or cross-disciplinary theory.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, we propose a new method based on this in-
sight, that allows us to estimate new policies given a data
distribution both for off-policy or on-policy reinforcement
learning." (p. 1)
- "In this paper, we have introduced a new reinforcement learn-
ing method called Relative Entropy Policy Search." (p. 5)
