# Human-level Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning (2015)
Source: 3ed87f-2015.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a deep Q-network agent that learns policies from high-dimensional inputs via end-to-end reinforcement learning.
- Proposes a Q-learning variant with experience replay to stabilize training, indicating a training-method contribution.
