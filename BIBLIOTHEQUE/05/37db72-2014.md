# Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms (2014)
Source: 37db72-2014.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes deterministic policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning with continuous actions, which is a methodological contribution to learning and optimization.
- Introduces an off-policy actor-critic algorithm for learning a deterministic target policy, focusing on the learning procedure rather than data or positional encoding.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper we consider deterministic policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning with continuous actions." (Abstract)
- "we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy." (Abstract)
