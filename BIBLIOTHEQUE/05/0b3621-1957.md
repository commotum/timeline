# The Perceptron: A Perceiving and Recognizing Automaton (1957)
Source: 0b3621-1957.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes the perceptron as a learning system for recognizing and categorizing patterns, which is a foundational ML model contribution.
- Focuses on the architecture and learning behavior of the perceptron rather than datasets/benchmarks or transformer-specific mechanisms.

## Evidence extracts
- "it should be feasible to construct an electronic or electromechanical system which will learn to recognize similarities or identities between patterns of optical, electrical, or tonal information, in a manner which may be closely analogous to the perceptual processes of a biological brain." (Section I. INTRODUCTION)
- "Its performance can then be described as a process of learning to give the same output signal (or print the same word) for all optical stimuli which belong to some arbitrarily constituted class," (Section II. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF A PHOTOPERCEPTRON)
