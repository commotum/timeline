# DeepSpeech2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin (2015)
Source: 3bc5e2-2015.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper presents an end-to-end deep learning ASR system and emphasizes model architecture and computational scale as key contributions rather than positional encoding or transformer-specific changes.
- The work centers on training methodology and architectural exploration for speech recognition, fitting an ML foundations/principles contribution instead of a dataset or benchmark resource.

## Evidence extracts
- "We show that an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to recognize either English or Mandarin Chinese speech—two vastly different languages." (Abstract)
- "Since Deep Speech 2 (DS2) is an end-to-end deep learning system, we can achieve performance gains by focusing on three crucial components: the model architecture, large labeled training datasets, and computational scale." (Section 1 Introduction)
