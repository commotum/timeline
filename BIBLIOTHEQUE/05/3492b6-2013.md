# Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space (2013)
Source: 3492b6-2013.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes novel model architectures for computing continuous word representations from large data sets, emphasizing efficient learning of word vectors.
- Focuses on model architecture and training methodology for word embeddings rather than datasets/benchmarks or positional encoding.

## Evidence extracts

- "In this section, we propose two new model architectures for learning distributed representations
of words that try to minimize computational complexity." (Section 3 New Log-linear Models)
