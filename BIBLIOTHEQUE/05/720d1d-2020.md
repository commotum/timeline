# How Much Position Information Do Convolutional Neural Networks Encode? (2020)
Source: 720d1d-2020.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper investigates a foundational property of CNN representations—whether and how absolute position information is implicitly encoded—rather than proposing transformer positional encodings or higher-dimensional transformer adaptations.
- The contribution is an empirical analysis and probing method (PosENet) that explains a training/architecture effect (zero-padding) in CNNs, fitting ML foundations and principles.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, we test this hypothesis revealing the surprising degree of absolute position information that is encoded in commonly used neural networks." (p. 1, Abstract)
- "Results point to zero padding and borders as an anchor from which spatial information is derived and eventually propagated over the whole image as spatial abstraction occurs." (p. 9, Conclusion)
