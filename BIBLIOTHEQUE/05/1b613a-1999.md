# Actor-Critic Algorithms (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: 1b613a-1999.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes and analyzes actor-critic algorithms for simulation-based optimization of Markov decision processes with parameterized policies, which is a foundational reinforcement learning method rather than a dataset/benchmark or positional encoding contribution.
- Focuses on algorithm design and convergence analysis for actor-critic methods, fitting ML foundations and training methodology.

## Evidence extracts
- "We propose and analyze a class of actor-critic algorithms for simulation-based optimization of a Markov decision process over a parameterized family of randomized stationary policies." (Abstract)
- "In this paper, we propose some actor-critic algorithms and provide an overview of a convergence proof." (Introduction)
