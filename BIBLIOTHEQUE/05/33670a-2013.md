# Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes (2013)
Source: 33670a-2013.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a reparameterized variational lower-bound estimator for inference/learning, which is a methodological ML contribution rather than positional encoding, dimensional lifting, or datasets.
- Frames a recognition-model-based variational auto-encoder approach for continuous latent-variable models, aligning with ML foundations/principles.

## Evidence extracts
- "reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a simple differentiable unbiased estimator" (p. 1)
- "a neural network is used for the recognition model, we arrive at the variational auto-encoder." (p. 1)
