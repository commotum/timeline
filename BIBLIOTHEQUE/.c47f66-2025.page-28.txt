                        Distributions = Ending Balance
                        For Company 2, we know Beginning Balance: $63,180; Net Income: $0; Net Loss: $12,000;
                        Investments: $0; Distributions: $51,180. Let (Ending Balance) be (E). Now, input the known values
                        into the equation: 63,180 + 0 - 12,000 + 0 - 51,180 = E. Simplify the equation: 63,180 - 12,000 - 51,180 =

                        Equity schedule, we'll use the Owners' Equity formula: Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Net
                        Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions. For Company 2: Beginning Balance = $63,180; Net
                        Income = $0; Net Loss = $12,000; Investments = ?; Distributions = $51,180; Ending Balance = ? We
                        needtosolvefor "Investments". First, isolate the "Investments" term in the equation: Ending Balance
                        =BeginningBalance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions. Substituting the known
                        values: ? = $63,180 + $0 - $12,000 + Investments - $51,180. Rearrange to solve for "Investments":
                        Investments = Ending Balance + $12,000 + $51,180 - $63,180. We will calculate it step by step: Ending
                        Balance + $12,000 + $51,180 - $63,180. Since we're not given the ending balance directly in this part

                        Company 1 Ending Balance = 163800 + 16500 - 0 + ? - 1750 = 254150. I will represent the ending
                        balance as x because it is not provided directly. However, inspecting the options, we need to find
                        the Investments without ending value explicitly needed in a traditional numerical sense by solving
                        for unknowns while seeing investment values as discreet variables from options given. Getting
                        closest match value is the next best approach: So basically add all options here to validate closest
