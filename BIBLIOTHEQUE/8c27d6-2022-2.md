# TransFusion: Robust LiDAR-Camera Fusion for 3D Object Detection With Transformers (2022)
Source: 8c27d6-2022.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper introduces a transformer-based detection head for LiDAR-camera fusion in 3D object detection, which is an adaptation of Transformers to a higher-dimensional sensing domain.
- The main contribution is a 3D detection architecture that fuses LiDAR point clouds and images using transformer decoder layers, rather than positional encoding changes or dataset creation.

## Evidence extracts
