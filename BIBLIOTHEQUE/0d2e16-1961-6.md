# New Results in Linear Filtering and Prediction Theory (1961)
Source: 0d2e16-1961.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper focuses on linear filtering/prediction theory and derives a Riccati-type variance equation for optimal filtering error, a control/estimation contribution rather than an ML modeling advance.
- It frames results around the duality between stochastic estimation and deterministic control, situating the work in control theory/engineering outside the ML taxonomy.

## Evidence extracts
- "A nonlinear differential equation of the Riccati type is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal filtering error." (p. 1)
- "The Duality Principle relating stochastic estimation and deterministic control problems plays an important role in the proof of theoretical results." (p. 1)
