# Learning Semantic String Transformations from Examples (2012)
Source: 31ff72-2012.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a programming-by-example system with an expressive semantic string transformation language and an inductive synthesis algorithm.
- Focuses on algorithmic synthesis of string transformations from input-output examples rather than datasets, benchmarks, or transformer architectures.

## Evidence extracts
- "We describe an expressive transformation language for
semantic manipulation that combines table lookup opera-
tions and syntactic manipulations. We then present a syn-
thesis algorithm that can learn all transformations in the
language that are consistent with the user-provided set of
input-output examples. We have implemented this technol-
ogy as an add-in for the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet system
and have evaluated it successfully over several benchmarks
picked from various Excel help-forums." (p. 1)
- "We also describe a systematic design of the synthesis al-
gorithm for the semantic string transformation language,
which can synthesize a set of semantic transformations that
are consistent with the given set of input-output examples." (p. 2)
