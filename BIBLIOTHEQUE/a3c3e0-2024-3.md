# X4D-SceneFormer: Enhanced Scene Understanding on 4D Point Cloud Videos through Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer (2024)
Source: a3c3e0-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a cross-modal Transformer-based knowledge transfer mechanism that injects RGB texture priors into 4D point cloud reasoning to overcome the modality’s sparsity and lack of semantics.
- Designs a training-time pipeline where a Gradient-aware Image Transformer and multi-level consistency losses align RGB and point-stream dynamics so that only point clouds are needed during inference.

## Evidence extracts
- "To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-modal knowledge transfer framework, called X4D-SceneFormer. This framework enhances 4D-Scene understanding by transferring texture priors from RGB sequences using a Transformer architecture with temporal relationship mining." (p. 2670)
- "The proposed framework, X4D-SceneFormer, takes multi-modal data (i.e., 4D point cloud, RGB sequences) as input during training, and achieves superior performance using only point cloud data during inference." (p. 2671)
