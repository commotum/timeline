Problem 4. Generator pass-rate: 4.5%. Here, the generator successfully per-
forms a complex series of polynomial factorizations. The use of the Sophie-
Germain identity in step 5 is an important step that could be considered in-
sightful.

Problem 5. Generator pass-rate: 4.5%. The generator attempts to use the
difference of squares formula in step 12 on an expression that isn’t in fact a
difference of squares. The reward model catches this mistake.
