# Dyna, an Integrated Architecture for Learning, Planning, and Reacting (Not specified in the paper)
Source: 165d02-1991.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper presents Dyna as an AI architecture that integrates learning, planning, and reactive execution.
- The algorithm uses hypothetical, model-generated experiences as a planning step within reinforcement learning.

## Evidence extracts
- "Dyna is an AI architecture that integrates learning, planning, and reactive execution." (p. 1)
- "The fifth step of the algorithm is essentially reinforcement learning from hypothetical, model-generated experiences; this is in effect a planning process." (p. 1)
