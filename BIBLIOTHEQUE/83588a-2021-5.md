# Stabilizing Equilibrium Models by Jacobian Regularization (2021)
Source: 83588a-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a Jacobian regularization scheme for DEQ models to stabilize fixed-point learning and convergence.
- Focuses on training/regularization and stability of implicit equilibrium networks, validated through experiments.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, we propose a regularization scheme for DEQ models that ex- plicitly regularizes the Jacobian of the ﬁxed-point update equations to stabilize the learning of equi- librium models." (p. 1)
- "Therefore, by constraining the Jacobian’s Frobenius norm, we encourage DEQs to opti- mize for stabler and simpler dynamics whose ﬁxed points are easier to solve for." (p. 6)
