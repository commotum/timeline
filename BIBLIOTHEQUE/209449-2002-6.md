# Optimal feedback control as a theory of motor coordination (2002)
Source: 209449-2002.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper frames its contribution around motor control and coordination, addressing how biomechanical degrees of freedom achieve a common goal.
- It proposes an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control.

## Evidence extracts
- "A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal." (p. 1)
- "Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control." (p. 1)
