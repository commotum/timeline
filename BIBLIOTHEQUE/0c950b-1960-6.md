# A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems (1960)
Source: 0c950b-1960.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is a control/communication theory treatment of linear filtering and prediction via Wiener filtering and state-transition analysis, not a machine learning model contribution.
- It develops estimation and filtering methods for dynamic systems and general solutions to the Wiener problem, making it an external foundational reference rather than an ML method paper.

## Evidence extracts
- "Tn all these works, the objective is to obtain the specification of a linear dynamic system (Wiener filter) which accomplishes the prediction, separation, or detection of a random signal." (p. 1)
- "With the state-transition method, a single derivation covers a large variety of problems: growing and infinite memory filters, stationary and nonstationary statistics, etc.; difficulty (3) disappears." (p. 2)
