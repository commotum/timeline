G_ Difficulty Breakdown

We show

performance of our ORM and PRM on each quintile of the MATH

dataset. We determine quintiles based on the pass rate under the generator.
It is interesting to note that the performance gap is not only apparent on high
difficulty problems: it is in fact apparent across all difficulties. For the lowest
difficulty problems, we see that it is possible to find adversarial examples that

fool the O

RM, since the ORM’s performance slightly decreases as the number of

samples increases. In contrast, the PRM remains highly robust over this same

set Of Sam

effect on t:

ples.

We also see that increasing the number of samples has the largest positive

he highest difficulty problems. This is to be expected, since a large

number of generator samples may be required to find a true and convincing
solution to a hard problem.
