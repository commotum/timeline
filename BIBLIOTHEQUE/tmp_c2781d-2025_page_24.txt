              Review your current plan and observations.
              • If you do not have a plan yet, create one.
              • If your plan is outdated or needs changes, create a new plan.
              If you create a new plan, output it in the following format:
              <plan>YOUR NEW PLAN</plan>
              Replace YOUR NEW PLAN with your revised plan.
              If your current plan is still valid, proceed without outputting it
              again.
              After this evaluation (and any necessary replanning), output exactly
              ONE allowed action.
              Output nothing else except an optional <plan>...</plan> block and
              that single action.
                Prompt 20: Prompt allowing the model to decide when to plan based on task context.
