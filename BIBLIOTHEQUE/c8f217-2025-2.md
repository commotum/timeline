# Relation3D: Enhancing Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: c8f217-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes Relation3D for point cloud instance segmentation, focusing on improving relation modeling for that domain.
- Uses a transformer decoder with instance queries in the 3D field, aligning the contribution with transformer architectures for point cloud instance segmentation rather than datasets or positional encoding changes.

## Evidence extracts
- "The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) WeproposeRelation3D: Enhancing Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation, which achieves accurate and efficient point cloud instance segmentation predictions." (Section 1. Introduction)
- "Transformer-based Methods. Following 2D instance segmentation techniques [24, 43, 44], in the 3D field, each object instance is represented as an instance query, with query features learned through a vanilla transformer decoder." (Section 2. Related Work)
