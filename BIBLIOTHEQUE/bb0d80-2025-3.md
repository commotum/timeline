# ARC-NCA: Towards Developmental Solutions to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (2025)
Source: bb0d80-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces ARC-NCA as a developmental approach built on Neural Cellular Automata (including EngramNCA with hidden memories) to tackle ARC-AGI, centering a new computational mechanism for abstraction/reasoning tasks.
- Solves ARC via test-time training, indicating a mechanism that changes how computation/inference is performed for each task rather than proposing new data or positional encoding.
