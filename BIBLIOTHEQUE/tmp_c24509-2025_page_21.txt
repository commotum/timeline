               9 AdditionalQualitativeResults
               In this section, we provide additional qualitative results on the Occ3D-Waymo [40] and CarlaSC [42] datasets
               to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
               9.1  UnconditionalDynamicSceneGeneration
               First, we present full unconditional generation results in Fig. 9 and 10. These results demonstrate that our
               generated scenes are of high quality, realistic, and contain significant detail, capturing both the overall scene
               dynamics and the movement of objects within the scenes.

               frames generated by DynamicCity on Occ3D-Waymo [40]. Best viewed in colors and zoomed-in for additional details.
