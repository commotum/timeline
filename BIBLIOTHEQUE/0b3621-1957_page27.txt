AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE DISCRIMINATION METHOD

Fig. 6 shows a system with 6) A-units, indicating the
particular units (chosen at random) which respond to each of six
stimulus patterns, The 32 units in the left half of each block are
connected to Ry» and the 32 units in the right half of each block are
connected to Re Ry and R,
with zero overlap between their corresponding association sets. When
Ry is active, the Ry 5 is active, the Ry
set is suppressed, Let us consider an experiment in which S55 Soe and
S$, are all to be associated to Ry» while 5) Sys and Se are all to be

3

associated to Rye Thus the active units shown in the left half of the

Sy diagram will each gain one unit of "value" due to the 5, -R, associa-

represent mutually exclusive responses,

set is suppressed, and when R

tion, and, similarly, the active units in the left halves of the So and
53 diagrams will gain a wit of value for each association in which
they participate. The active mits shown on the right side of the
diagrams will gain in value for the Sy Ses and 5¢ associations. After
all six associations have been formed, the value distribution will be

as shown in Fige 7ae If we then superimpose the S, configuration (show

by underlining in Fig. 7a) we can add up the net value for the Ry set
and for the Ry set, that would be evoked by such a presentation. We
find a bias of 18 to 6, in favor of Ry; which means that the Ry response

would occur, suppressing R If we add up the bias in the same manner

2°
for each of the other "stimulus patterns", we find that the biases are

as follows:
