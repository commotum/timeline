# Making Working Memory Work: A Computational Model of Learning in the Prefrontal Cortex and Basal Ganglia (2006)
Source: 2695de-2006.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper centers on a computational model of working memory grounded in specific brain systems (prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia), indicating a neuroscience focus rather than a transformer/ML architecture change.
- The framing is biological and cognitive (executive function, brain areas), which fits cross-disciplinary context for ML.
