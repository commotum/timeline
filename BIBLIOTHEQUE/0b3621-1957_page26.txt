reliably excite at least a few units in every

Note that the value established for @ represents the minimum stimulus

size to which the system will be capable of responding.

In practice, the optimum design of a system subject to
a given set of constraints can be found by finding the value of 8,
with the corresponding X and Y from the above equations, for which

the function

F(%.4sNs5> 91 Ret) - | Rerit| (@<R)

is at aminimum. The function F is the value of Ps obtained by
equation 1. For a system yielding a P. exactly equal to the constrain-
ing value, the minimum of this expression should be exactly equal to
