                   AnExample of Statistical Investigation of the Text Eugene
                   Onegin Concerning the Connection of Samples in Chains
                   A. A. Markov
                   (Lecture at the physical-mathematical faculty, Royal Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, 23 January
                          1
                   1913)
                   This study investigates a text excerpt containing 20,000 Russian letters of the alphabet,
                   excluding       and      ,2 from Pushkin’s novel Eugene Onegin – the entire ﬁrst chapter and
                   sixteen stanzas of the second.
                      This sequence provides us with 20,000 connected trials, which are either a vowel
                   or a consonant.
                      Accordingly, we assume the existence of an unknown constant probability p that the
                   observed letter is a vowel. We determine the approximate value of p by observation,
                   by counting all the vowels and consonants. Apart from p, we shall ﬁnd – also through
                   observation – the approximate values of two numbers p and p , and four numbers
                                                                                             1         0
                   p   , p   , p   ,andp .Theyrepresent the following probabilities: p – a vowel follows
                    1,1   1,0   0,1         0,0                                                           1
                   anothervowel;p –avowelfollowsaconsonant;p                          –avowelfollowstwovowels;p                  –
                                        0                                         1,1                                        1,0
                   a vowel follows a consonant that is preceded by a vowel; p                     – a vowel follows a vowel
                                                                                              0,1
                   that is preceded by a consonant; and, ﬁnally, p                 – a vowel follows two consonants.
                                                                               0,0
                      The indices follow the same system that I introduced in my paper “On a Case of
                   Samples Connected in Complex Chain” [Markov 1911b]; with reference to my other
                   paper, “Investigation of a Remarkable Case of Dependent Samples” [Markov 1907a],
                   however, p = p . We denote the opposite probabilities for consonants with q and
                                 0       2
                   indices that follow the same pattern.
                      If we seek the value of p, we ﬁrst ﬁnd 200 approximate values from which we
                   can determine the arithmetic mean. To be precise, we divide the entire sequence of
                   20,000 letters into 200 separate sequences of 100 letters, and count how many vowels
                   there are in each 100: we obtain 200 numbers, which, when divided by 100, yield 200
                   approximate values of p.

                   2 In Russian, these letters are hard and soft signs, which are not pronounced independently but modify the
                   pronunciation of the preceding letter.
              592  A. A. Markov
                 When we determine the number of vowels, we wish to retain the possibility of
              constructing other combinations of 100 letters; we write down each hundred in a
              square with ten rows and ten columns maintaining the order of the letters:
                               12345678910
                              11,  12,  13,  14,   15,  16,  17,  18,  19,    20
                              .....................................................
                              91,  92,  93,  94,   95,  96,  97,  98,  99,   100.
                 Next, we count how many vowels there are in each column taken separately and
              join the numbers in pairs:
                   the 1st and 6th, 2nd and 7th, 3rd and 8th, 4th and 9th, 5th and 10th.
                 In this way, we obtain ﬁve numbers for each 100 letters, which we denote with the
              following symbols
                                   (1,6),  (2,7),   (3,8),  (4,9),  (5,10);
              and the following sum
                                     (1,6) + (2,7) + (3,8) + (4,9) + (5,10)
              represents the total number of vowels in this hundred.
                 If we combine 500 letters, we can construct ﬁve new groups of 100 letters each: the
              ﬁrst – from the ﬁrst and sixth column, the second – from the second and the seventh,
              and so on.
                 The number of vowels in these new groups of 100, obviously, is made up from the
              following sums
                          (1,6),(2,7),(3,8),(4,9),(5,10),
              which consist of the corresponding ﬁve summands.
                 The results of our counts are entered in forty small tables, each containing the
              following: in the ﬁrst row – ﬁve numbers (1,6) and their sum, in the second row – ﬁve
              numbers (2,7) and their sum, etc., in the last row – the number of vowels in the ﬁrst
              hundred, second hundred, etc., and ﬁnally the number of vowels in all ﬁve hundreds;
              to save space, reduced by 200:
                                                                        Statistical Investigation of the Text Eugene Onegin   593
               594  A. A. Markov
                 First, we shall look at the group of numbers
                               42,   46,    40,   44,   43,   44,   45,   43,...
               which are found in the last rows of our 40 small tables and show the number of vowels
               in consecutive groups of 100 letters of the text, for example:
                                                     etc.3
                 We start a new table by counting how often each of the numbers occurs in this
               group.
                 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 
                  3  1  6 18 12 31 43 29 25 17 12 2  1 
                 In the ﬁrst row are all the numbers that occur in the group, and in the second row
               beneath it, how often they appear.
                 With the aid of this table, the arithmetic mean is easy to ﬁnd
               43+ 29+25×2+17×3+12×4+2×5+6−31−12×2−18×3−6×4−5−3×6 =43.19
                                                     200
               and from this it follows that
                                              p = 0.4319 = 0.432.
                 Next, we calculate the sum of the squares of their deviations from 43.2; it is
                                                    1022.8,
               divided by 200, we get
                                                     5.114,
               and this number can be regarded as the approximate quantity of the mathematical
               expectation of the square of the deviation of each of our 200 numbers from their
               commonmathematical expectation, which is 43.2. Finally, the number
                                                5.114 = 0.02557
                                                 200
               3 This is the beginning of Pushkin’s text.
                                                                        Statistical Investigation of the Text Eugene Onegin   595
                   represents the approximate quantity of the mathematical expectation of the square of
                   the error when determining 100 p with the equation
                                                                 100 p = 43.2.
                      Such a deduction is associated with the usual assumption of the method of least
                   squares, namely, that we are dealing with independent quantities. This assumption is
                   not less justiﬁed in this case than in many others, because the connection between the
                   numbers is fairly weak due to the way in which they were obtained.
                      Onecan also discern a certain correspondence of our results with the well-known
                   law of error, which is associated with the names of Gauss and Laplace; for example,
                   the quantity called probable error in our case is
                                                                      √
                                                              0.67 ·     5.11 = 1.5
                   and accordingly, between
                                             43.2 −1.5 = 41.7and43.2+1.5 = 44.7
                   lie 103 numbers, that is, approximately half [of the total]: 31 times the number 42, 43
                   times the number 43, and 29 times the number 44.
                      To the independence of the quantities corresponds the fact that when we combine
                   them in twos, fours, or ﬁves, and calculate for these 100, 50, and 40 combinations the
                   sums of the squares of their deviations from
                                                        86.4,      172.8,      and     216,
                   weobtain the numbers
                                                          827.6,       975.2,      1004,
                   which do not differ very much from the number found earlier
                                                                      1022.8.
                      Now, if we move on from samples in hundreds to single samples, we ascertain that
                   the number
                                                               5.114 = 0.05114
                                                                 100
                   differs strongly from
                                                        0.432×0.568 = 0.245376 :
                   the coefﬁcient of dispersion (we deviate here slightly from usual terminology, whereby
                   we should have taken the square root of the number that we call the coefﬁcient of
                   dispersion) is
                                                                 5114      =0.208,
                                                               24537.6
              596  A. A. Markov
              that is, approximately 1, which is explained well by the connectedness of our samples.
                                   5
                 To clarify this connectedness, although not entirely, it will help us to calculate the
              above-mentioned probabilities p and p approximately.
                                             1     0
                 Wetake the entire text of 20,000 letters, count the number of sequences
                                                vowel, vowel,
              and obtain the number 1104; after dividing it by the total number of vowels in the
              text, we get the following approximate quantity for p1:
                                                1104 = 0.128.
                                                8638
                 In the same manner, we could ﬁnd an approximate value for q0 by counting the
              number of sequences
                                            consonant, consonant
              and dividing it by 11,362, then p = 1 − q . However, we can also substitute the tiring
                                             0        0
              direct count with the following. If we subtract 1104 from 8638, we obtain the number
              of consonants
                                                    7534,
              which follow a vowel, and as all consonants apart from the ﬁrst one must follow either
              a vowel or a consonant, the number of sequences
                                            consonant, consonant
              is determined by the difference
                                           11,361−7534 = 3827.
                 Therefore, we get the following approximate quantity for p0
                                           7534 = 7534 = 0.663.
                                          11,361    11,362
                 As we can see, the probability of a letter being a vowel changes considerably
              depending upon which letter – vowel or consonant – precedes it. The difference
              p – p , which we denote with the [Greek] letter δ is
               1    0
                                          0.128−0.663 =−0.535.
                 Now, if we assume that the sequence of 20,000 letters forms a simple chain, then
              for
                                                 δ =−0.535,
              accordingto“InvestigationofaRemarkableCaseof DependentSamples,”thenumber
                                             1+δ = 465 =0.3
                                             1−δ      1535
                                                                        Statistical Investigation of the Text Eugene Onegin   597
                   can be regarded as the theoretical dispersion coefﬁcient; naturally, this number does
                   not agree exactly with the previously found
                                                                      0.208,
                   but it is closer to it than to one, which corresponds to the case of independent samples.
                      If we consider the sequence as a complex chain and apply the ﬁndings of the study
                   “OnaCaseof Samples Connected in Complex Chain,” we can make the theoretical
                   dispersion coefﬁcient agree still better with the experimental one.
                      For this, we count the number of the combinations
                                                             vowel, vowel, vowel
                   and
                                                    consonant, consonant, consonant
                   in our sequence. According to my count, there are 115 cases of the ﬁrst combination
                   andofthesecond–505.Whenwedividethesenumbersbythenumbersfoundearlier
                                                              1104      and     3827,
                   weget the approximate equations
                                            p    = 115 = 0.104,            q     = 505 = 0.132.

                      With the aim of applying the ﬁndings of the above-mentioned article to our case
                   here, we assume that
                            p = 0.432,       q = 0.568,         p1 = 0.128,         q1 = 0.872,         p0 = 0.663,
                                             q0 = 0.337,         p1,1 = 0.104,         q0,0 = 0.132
                   and from these numbers we get
                                                            −24                                205
                                 δ =−0.535,           ε =          =−0.027,          η=− =−0.309.
                                                             872                               663
                      Next, we turn to the expression of the coefﬁcient of dispersion
                        {                                                                          }
                         q(1−3ε)(1−η)+ p(1−3η)(1−ε)−2(1−ε)(1−η) (1−δ)+2(1−εη)
                                                             (1 −δ)(1−ε)(1−η)
                           =1+δ 1+ε + 1+η +(q −p)(η−ε),
                              1−δ 2(1−ε)                2(1 −η)            (1 −ε)(1−η)
                   which corresponds to the conditions of my article and is derived there.
                      If we insert here the values found
                                                                  p, q, δ, ε, η
              598  A. A. Markov
              and calculate the result, we obtain
                                                    0.195
              as coefﬁcient of dispersion, which agrees very well with the number
                                                    0.208,
              found following general rules and independent of our special assumptions, so that one
              can hardly demand any better agreement.
                 Of course, we cannot claim that our example satisﬁes fully all theoretical
              assumptions; however, on the other hand, we can scarcely believe that the agreement of
              the numberswehavediscoveredispurecoincidence;rather,thatitisrelatedtoacertain
              correspondence of the theoretical assumptions and the conditions of the example.
                 Now,weshall turn to the other arrangement of the 20,000 letters in hundreds that
              we have made. We construct a table with the repetitions of individual numbers, like
              the one before.
               26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41

               42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 
               17 16 15 10 10 16 10 10 5  5  3  3  3  0  1 2 
                 The arithmetic mean of these 200 new numbers is the same as before
                                                    43.19.
                 However,thesumofthesquaresoftheirdeviationsfrom43.2isconsiderablygreater
              than before; it is, namely,
                                                   5788.8.
                 Here, it is necessary to pay attention to the assumption of the independence of the
              quantities, which is usually connected with the method of least squares (see chapter VII
              of my book “Calculus of Probability”); let us recall why this assumption is necessary. It
              is necessary to determine the weight of the end result that is expressed by equation (21),
              and also to calculate the mathematical expectation W, which gives the approximate
              value k (see my book). However, this condition will prove to be superﬂuous, if ﬁrst,
              we leave aside the question of the weight of equation (21), and second, replace ξ in
              expression W with the number a, which we shall assume to be equal to a ,inthatwe
                                                                                    0
              disregard the difference a–a. Then, the equations
                                         0
                                   M.E. px + px +···+p(n) x(n) = a
                                              p + p +···+p(n)
                                                                        Statistical Investigation of the Text Eugene Onegin   599
                   and
                                  M.E. p(x −a)2 + p(x − a)2 +···+p(n)(x(n) −a)2 = k
                                                                           n
                   form the basis of our deductions,4 not requiring any independence of the quantities
                                                               x, x,...,x(n).
                      Based on such equations and the law of large numbers, we suggest that
                                                a = pa + pa +···+p(n)a(n) = a
                                                             p + p +···+p(n)                     0
                   and
                                                     p(i) a(i)          2     p(i) a(i)           2
                                               k =           (    −a) =               (    −a0) .
                                                               n                         n
                      Only the theorem of the weight of the end result, which is expressed by the well-
                   knownequation (22), is disregarded: the weight of the result is the same as the sum of
                   the weights of all parts.
                      Inthegivencase,eachofour200numbersrepresentsthesumofnearlyindependent
                   quantities; however, the sums themselves are connected in groups of ﬁve so that only
                   forty of them can be regarded as independent. We have 40 groups of 500 letters each;
                   in no group of 100 are there letters that are adjacent in the text and this is the reason for
                   the observed independence of the parts; on the other hand, in each group the letters of
                   the ﬁrst hundred are next to those of the second hundred, those of the second hundred
                   are next to both those of the ﬁrst and those of the third, etc., and for this reason, as
                   mentioned above, our numbers are connected in groups of ﬁve.
                      Under these conditions and according to the given explanations, the number
                                                               5788.8 = 28.944
                                                                 200
                   can be considered as the approximate value of the mathematical expectation of the
                   square of the deviations of our 200 new numbers
                                                    49,     42,      38,     42,     44,     ...
                   from their mathematical expectation, which is approximately
                                                                       43.2.
                      If we pass over from the letters (samples) in hundreds to the single letters, we
                   ascertain that the number
                                                                     0.28944
                   4 M. E. = mathematical expectation.
              600  A. A. Markov
              does not differ signiﬁcantly from
                                         0.432×0.568 = 0.245376 :
              the dispersion coefﬁcient is
                                                28944 = 1.18.
                                               24537.6
                 If we now turn to the end result
                                                    43.19,
              then because of the connectedness of the numbers
                                       49,   42,  38,   42,   44,   ...
              the mathematical expectation of its square of error can no longer be expressed by
                                              28.944 = 0.14472;
                                               200
              onthecontrary, corresponding to the results of the initial arrangement of the letters in
              hundreds, it can be expressed (of course, approximately) by the number
                                              5.114 = 0.02557.
                                               200
                 The connectedness of the numbers as mentioned appears when their sums are
              combined in twos, fours, and particularly in ﬁves. If we calculate for these 100, 50,
              and 40 combinations the sums of the squares of their deviations from
                                         86.4,   172.8,   and   216,
              instead of
                                                    5788.8
              weobtain the numbers
                                          3551.6,   3089.2,   1004,
              the last of which is nearly six times smaller than 5788.8.
