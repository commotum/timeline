            Fig. 16. Comparison between sizes of programs generated by different algorithms. Fig. 16a, Fig. 16b and
            Fig. 16c compare Probe vs. size-based enumeration, EuPhony and CVC4, respectively, on the String domain;
            graphs are log scale. Fig. 16d, Fig. 16e and Fig. 16f compare the same pairs of tools on the BitVec domain and
            Fig. 16g, Fig. 16h and Fig. 16i on the Circuit domain; graphs are linear scale.
            programs synthesized by Probe and by CVC4. The results are plotted in Fig. 17a. The number
            of ites is normalized by number of examples in the task specification. Probe averages 0.01 ite
            per example (for all but one benchmark Probe solutions do not contain an ite), whereas CVC4
            averages 0.42 ites per example. When also considering benchmarks Probe cannot solve, some

            Generalization Accuracy. Finally, we test the generality of the synthesized programsÐwhether
            they generalize well to additional examples, or in other words, whether synthesis returns reusable
            code. Concretely, we measure generalization accuracy [Alpaydin 2014], the percentage of unseen
