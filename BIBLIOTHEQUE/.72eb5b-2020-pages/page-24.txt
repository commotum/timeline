              experiment is small, it provides a glimpse into the extent to which CVC4 solutions sometimes

              the SyGuS language is unfamiliar to most readers, we believe that these solutions should appear
              simple and clearly understandable. In comparison, the CVC4 solutions to these benchmarks are
              dozens or hundreds of operations long.
              Solution quality. The experiments in this section explored solution quality via three empirical
              measures: solution size, the number of case-splits, and the ability of solutions to generalize to new
              examplesforthesametask.Theseresultsshowconclusivelythat,whileCVC4isconsiderablyfaster
              than Probe, and solves more benchmarks, the quality of its solutions is significantly worse.
              6.6    Conclusions
              In conclusion, we have shown that Probe is faster and solves more benchmarks than unguided
              enumerativetechniques, which confirms that just-in-time learning is an improvement on a baseline
              synthesizer. We have also shown that Probe is faster and solves more benchmarks than EuPhony,
              a probabilistic synthesizer with a pre-learned model, based on top-down enumeration. Finally, we
              have explored the quality of synthesized solutions via size, case splitting, and generalizability, and
              found that even though CVC4 solves more benchmarks than Probe, its solutions to example-based
              benchmarksoverfit to the examples, and are therefore neither readable nor reusable; in contrast,
              Probe’s solutions are small and generalize perfectly.

              Enumerative Program Synthesis. Despite their simplicity, enumerative program synthesizers
              are known to be very effective: ESolver [Alur et al. 2013] and EUSolver [Alur et al. 2017b] have
              been past winners of the SyGuS competition [Alur et al. 2016, 2017a]. Enumerative synthesizers
              typically explore the space of programs either top-down, by extending a partial program tree
              from the node towards the leaves [Alur et al. 2017b; Kalyan et al. 2018; Koukoutos et al. 2017; Lee
