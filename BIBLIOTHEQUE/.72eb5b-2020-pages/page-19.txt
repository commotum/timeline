              Schemesaredescribed in Sec. 5.2; all represents no selection (all partial solutions are used to update the
              PCFG). Timeout is 10 min, graph scale is linear.

              the String suite, Probe solves 48 benchmarks, with an average time of 29s and a median time of
              8.3s. EuPhony solves 23 benchmarks, with average of 15.4s and a median of 0.7s. CVC4 solves 75
              benchmarks, with an average of 61.8s and a median of 10.2s.

              27 of the 82 benchmarks solved with a 60 minute timeout. Even with the reduced timeout, Probe
              vastly outperforms EuPhony.
