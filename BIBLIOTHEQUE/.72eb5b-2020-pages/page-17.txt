              Just-in-Time Learning for Bottom-Up Enumerative Synthesis                                                  227:17
              EuPhony[Leeetal.2018] also uses probabilistic models to guide its search, but unlike Probe they
              are pre-learned models. We used the trained models that are available in EuPhony’s repository
              [eup 2018]. CVC4 [Reynolds et al. 2019] has been the winner of the PBE-Strings track of the SyGuS
              Competition [Alur et al. 2017a] since 2017. We use the CVC4 version 1.8 (Aug 6 2020 build).
              Experimental setup. All experiments were run with a 10 minute timeout for all solvers, on a
              commodityLenovolaptopwithai7quad-coreCPU@1.90GHzwith16GBofRAM.

              6.2   Q1.1: Effectiveness of Just-in-time learning
              Toassess the effectiveness of the just-in-time learning approach implemented in Probe, we first
              compareittotwounguidedbottom-upsearchalgorithms:height-basedandsize-basedenumeration.

              Results for String Domain. We measure the time to solution for each of the 82 benchmarks in
              the String benchmark set, for each of the three methods: Probe, size-based, and height-based
              enumeration. The results are shown in Fig. 13a. Probe, size-based and height-based enumeration
