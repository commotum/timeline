        We should note that the EuPhony model we used for this experiment was trained on the
      EuPhonysetofbit-vector benchmarks (the ones we excluded because of the case-splits) rather
      than the Hacker’s Delight benchmarks. Although EuPhony does very well on its own bit-vector
      benchmarks, it does not fare so well on Hacker’s Delight. These results shed some light on how
      brittle pre-trained models are in the face of subtle changes in syntactic program properties, even
      within a single bit-vector domain; we believe this makes a case for just-in-time learning.
