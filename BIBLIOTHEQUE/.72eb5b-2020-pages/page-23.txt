                      (a) Number of ite operations per examples
               Fig. 17. Fig. 17a displays the number of ite operations per example for the String benchmarks solved by
               Probe and CVC4. CVC4 has a large number of case splits as indicated. Fig. 17b shows the generalization
               accuracy on unseen inputs for the 9 test benchmarks.
               inputs for which a generated program produces the correct output. To this end, we find a solution
               using Probe and CVC4, and then test it on additional examples for the same program.
                  Since most benchmarks in our suite contain only a few input-output examples, splitting these
               examples into a training and testing set would render most benchmarks severely underspecified.
               Instead we turn to a subset of the String benchmarks from the SyGuS Competition PBE-Strings
               suite. These are benchmark pairs where each task appears in a łshortž form with a small number of
               examples and a łlongž form with additional examples, but both represent the same task and share
               the same grammar. There are nine such benchmark pairs in this suite.
                  Wecomparethegeneralization accuracy of CVC4 and Probe by using the short benchmark of
               each pair to synthesize a solution, and, if a solution is found, we test it on the examples of the long
               version of the benchmark to see how well it generalizes. The results are shown in Fig. 17b.

                  Thefirst part of the table shows the benchmarks where Probe finds a solution. As discussed
               above, Probe rarely finds solutions with case splits, so it is not surprising that once it finds a
               program, that program is not at all overfitted to the examples.
