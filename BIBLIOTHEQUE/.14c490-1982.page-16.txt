Figure 18.8 Comparison of the effects of lateral striate lesions with those of medial Striate
lesions on (A) postoperative acquisition of a pattern discrimination and (B) postoperative
retention of the landmark task. Adapted from Ungerleider and Mishkin 1978a.

before operation both on a pattern-discrimination task, to assess re-
sidual inferior temporal function, and on the landmark task, to assess
residual posterior parietal function. For purposes of comparison, their
scores are plotted in figure 18.8 together with those of monkeys with
either bilateral inferior temporal or bilateral posterior parietal lesions

The data indicate that on the pattern-discrimination task severe im-
pairment was produced by inferior temporal but not by posterior
parietal lesions, whereas on the landmark task severe impairment fol-
lowed posterior parietal but not inferior temporal lesions. This, then, is
another instance of the dissociation of visual recognition and visual
spatial functions of temporal and parietal cortex, respectively. Of more
direct concern for the question of differences in anatomical organiza-
tion, however, were the effects of the striate lesions. Here the data indi-
cate that on the pattern-discrimination task impairment was produced
only by lateral striate-cortex lesions, whereas on the landmark task
equally severe impairment followed lateral and medial striate-cortex le-
sions. Apparently, inputs from central vision are especially important
for the visual recognition functions of the inferior temporal cortex, but
inputs from central and peripheral vision are equally important for the
visual spatial functions of posterior parietal cortex.

Thus, although interactions with striate cortex are critical for the
parietal just as for the temporal area, the inputs of the striate cortex to
these two regions appear to be organized differently; relative to inferior
temporal cortex, posterior parietal cortex receives a smaller contribution
from contralateral striate-cortex inputs (representing the ipsilateral vi-
sual field) but a greater contribution from medial inputs (representing
