# Beyond Brute Force: A Neuro-Symbolic Architecture for Compositional Reasoning in ARC-AGI-2 (2025)
Source: c02431-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper argues that purely neural or purely symbolic systems are insufficient for ARC-AGI-2 and motivates a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework integrating perception with explicit reasoning.
- The main contribution is a staged neuro-symbolic reasoning pipeline that changes how computation is performed to solve ARC-AGI-2 tasks.

## Evidence extracts
- "Weposit that neither purely connectionist neural architectures nor strictly symbolic reasoning systems are suffi- cient to meet the requirements of ARC-AGI-2. Instead, a neuro-symbolic framework integrating subsymbolic per- ception with explicit reasoning provides a more comprehensive computational model." (p. 1)
- "Weproposeafour-stageneuro-symbolic(NS)pipelinethatintegrates deterministic symbolic perception with neurally guidedreasoningandgeneration." (p. 5)
