# Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks (2016)
Source: 469434-2016.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a new residual unit design to make training easier and improve generalization in deep ResNets, which is an architectural/training-method contribution.
- Focuses on analyzing and improving deep residual network building blocks and optimization behavior rather than introducing a dataset/benchmark or positional encoding change.

## Evidence extracts
- "This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and improves generalization." (p. 1)
- "The proposed unit makes ResNet-1001 easier to train." (p. 2)
