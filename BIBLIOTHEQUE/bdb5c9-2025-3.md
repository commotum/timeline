# ArcMemo: Abstract Reasoning Composition with Lifelong LLM Memory (2025)
Source: bdb5c9-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a memory-augmented framework that stores abstract concepts and retrieves them at inference time to enable test-time continual learning for reasoning tasks.
- Centers the contribution on a read/write external memory mechanism that continually updates during inference.

## Evidence extracts
- "At inference time, relevant concepts are selected and integrated into context, enabling test-time continual learning without expensive weight updates. Our design encapsulates two primary operations: (i) writing to memory: formatting concepts for abstraction and generality; and (ii) reading from memory: selecting a subset of concepts for the current problem." (p. 2)
