                             Figures 9-11 give summary signiﬁcance levels of pairwise tests of signiﬁcance between estimators on
                             the black-box and ground-truth problems. All pair-wise statistical tests are Wilcoxon signed-rank
                             tests. A Bonferroni correction was applied, yielding the α levels given in each. This methodology
                             for assessing statistical signiﬁcance is based on the recommendations of Demšar [82] for comparing
                             multiple estimators over many datasets. These ﬁgures are intended to complement Figures 1-3 in
                             which effect sizes are shown.
