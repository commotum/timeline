                                                                     Abstract
                                   Manypromising approaches to symbolic regression have been presented in recent years,
                                   yet progress in the ﬁeld continues to suffer from a lack of uniform, robust, and transparent
                                   benchmarking standards. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by introducing an
                                   open-source, reproducible benchmarking platform for symbolic regression. We assess 14
                                   symbolic regression methods and 7 machine learning methods on a set of 252 diverse
        arXiv:2107.14351v1  [cs.NE]  29 Jul 2021regression problems. Our assessment includes both real-world datasets with no known
                                   model form as well as ground-truth benchmark problems, including physics equations
                                   and systems of ordinary differential equations. For the real-world datasets, we benchmark
                                   the ability of each method to learn models with low error and low complexity relative to
                                   state-of-the-art machine learning methods. For the synthetic problems, we assess each
                                   method’s ability to ﬁnd exact solutions in the presence of varying levels of noise. Under
                                   these controlled experiments, we conclude that the best performing methods for real-world
                                   regression combine genetic algorithms with parameter estimation and/or semantic search
                                   drivers. When tasked with recovering exact equations in the presence of noise, we ﬁnd that
                                   deep learning and genetic algorithm-based approaches perform similarly. We provide a
                                   detailed guide to reproducing this experiment and contributing new methods, and encourage
                                   other researchers to collaborate with us on a common and living symbolic regression
                                   benchmark.
