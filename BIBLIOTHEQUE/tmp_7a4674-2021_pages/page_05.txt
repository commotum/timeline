                                         Weevaluated SR methods on two separate tasks. First, we assessed their ability to make accurate
                                          predictions on “black-box” regression problems (in which the underlying data generating function
                                          remains unknown) while minimizing the complexity of the discovered models. Second, we tested
                                          the ability of each method to ﬁnd exact solutions to synthetic datasets with known, ground-truth
                                          functions, originating from physics and various ﬁelds of engineering.
                                          Thebasic experiment settings are summarized in Tbl. 2. Each algorithm was trained on each dataset
                                         (and level of noise, for ground-truth problems) in 10 repeated trials with a different random state
                                          that controlled both the train/test split and the seed of the algorithm. Datasets were split 75/25%
                                          in training and testing. For black-box regression problems, each algorithm was tuned using 5-fold
                                          cross validation with halving grid search. The SR algorithms were limited to 6 hyperparameter
                                          combinations; the ML methods were allowed more, as shown in Tbls. 4-6. The best hyperparameter
                                          settings were used to tune a ﬁnal estimator and evaluate it according to the metrics described above.
                                          Details for running the experiment are given in Sec. A.1.
