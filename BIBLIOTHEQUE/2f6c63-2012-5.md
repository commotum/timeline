# ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)
Source: 2f6c63-2012.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper’s core contribution is a large, deep convolutional neural network for ImageNet classification, reporting state-of-the-art results from that architecture.
- The contribution is about model architecture and depth (convolutional and fully-connected layers) rather than positional encoding, dimensional lifting for Transformers, or dataset/benchmark creation.

## Evidence extracts
- "The speciﬁc contributions of this paper are as follows: we trained one of the largest convolutional neural networks to date on the subsets of ImageNet used in the ILSVRC-2010 and ILSVRC-2012 competitions [2] and achieved by far the best results ever reported on these datasets." (p. 1)
- "Our ﬁnal network contains ﬁve convolutional and three fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any convolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model’s parameters) resulted in inferior performance." (p. 1)
