                 3.2  Benchmarks’Features
                 Since the solving strategies for synthesizers can be greatly inﬂuenced by the problem representation, we
                 quantify here some different features that are exhibited by the benchmarks from different categories in
                         1
                 Table 3.2. We consider here four main categories: 1) whether the invocation of the unknown function is
                 alwayspresent with the same set of arguments (single invocation) or there are multiple different function
                 invocations (multiple invocation), 2) whether there is a single unknown function (single unknown) or
                 multiple unknown functions (multiple unknown), 3) whether the speciﬁcation constraint is complete
                 (complete spec) or partially speciﬁed using input-output examples (partial spec), and ﬁnally 4) whether
                 the grammar for the unknown function is restricted, semi-general, or general.
                 Function Invocation  Wesayabenchmarkbelongstothesingleinvocationclass if the unknown func-
                 tion is called (possibly multiple times) with the same set of arguments in the speciﬁcation constraint. For
                 example, consider the speciﬁcation constraint for the max4 benchmark. This benchmark belongs to the
                 single invocation class because the max4 function is always called with the same set of arguments x, y,
                 z, and w.
                 (constraint (>= (max4 x y z w) x))
                 (constraint (>= (max4 x y z w) y))
                 (constraint (>= (max4 x y z w) z))
                 (constraint (>= (max4 x y z w) w))
                 (constraint (or (= x (max4 x y z w))
                               (or (= y (max4 x y z w))
                               (or (= z (max4 x y z w))
                                   (= w (max4 x y z w))))))
                    Similarly, we say a benchmark belongs to the multiple invocation class if the unknown function is
                 called multiple times with different set of arguments. For example, consider the icfp 7 10 benchmark,
                 where the unknown function f is called multiple times with different set of arguments.
                 (constraint (= (f #x1be88589ba201842) #xe4177a7645dfe7bd))
                 (constraint (= (f #x49ea2ae53e599623) #x93d455ca7cb32c46))
                 (constraint (= (f #xea82cc5e6104247d) #xea82cc5e6104247d))
                 (constraint (= (f #x75820d31bed79b87) #xeb041a637daf370e))
                 (constraint (= (f #xe682665199ee31a8) #x197d99ae6611ce57))
                 NumberofUnknownFunctions Wesayabenchmarkbelongstotheclassofsingleunknownclassif
                 there is only one unkown function that needs to be synthesized. For example, the max4 and icfp 7 10
                 benchmarks above require to synthesize a single function max4 and f respectively. The benchmarks that
                 require to synthesize multiple unknown functions are said to belong to the multiple unkown class. For
                 example, consider the speciﬁcation constraint from the s8 benchmark that requires to synthesize three
                 unknownfunctions f1, f2, and f3, such that their sum is equal to a given linear arithmetic expression.
                 (constraint (= (+ (+ (f1 x y z) (f2 x y z)) (f3 x y z)) (+ (+ x y) z)))
                 (constraint (= (f2 x y z) (- y 1)))
                   1Thementionedfeatures may not exist in all benchmarks of the category, but they are present in most of the benchmarks in
                 that category.
