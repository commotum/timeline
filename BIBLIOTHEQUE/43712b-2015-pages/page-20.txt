                         the general track of last year’s competition: The LIA track where the background theory is conditional
                         linear integer arithmetic and no grammar is given, instead the grammar is implicitly assumed to be that
                         of the LIA logic of SMT-LIB; and the INV track (also using LIA and no syntactic constraints) consisting
                         of invariant synthesis problems and using special constructs that convey the structure of an invariant
                         synthesis problem.
                               A total of eight solvers were submitted to this year’s competition. On the LIA and INV tracks
                         competed three solvers (with an overlap of two), and in the general track competed ﬁve solvers in seven
                         conﬁgurations. The winner of the LIA track and general track was the CVC4-1.5-SYGUS solver [14],
                         which is the only solver to participate in all tracks and the ﬁrst solver to implement a syntax-guided
                         synthesis engine inside an SMT solver. The winner of the INV track was the ICE-DT solver [11], a
                         special solver for invariant synthesis problems.
                               Weclassiﬁed the benchmarks participating in the competition into several categories and analyzed
                         the features a certain category has or has not. Correlating the results with the features we observe that
                         CVC4-1.5-SYGUS preforms best on benchmarks where there is a single function to be synthesized,
                         and that function is always invoked using the same set of parameters. On benchmarks with multiple
                         functions to synthesize or in which functions are invoked with different parameters, the ENUMERATIVE
                         and STOCHASTIC solver (which won ﬁrst and second place in last year’s competition) seem to preform
                         better.
                               We hope this report sheds some light on the correlations of solver’s performance and benchmark
                         features, and can be of help to improve the development of future solvers. In next year’s competition we
                         are considering devoting a track to benchmarks where obtaining a small expression is more crucial than
                         obtaining it fast, as is the case for instance, in compiler optimization problems.
