                 3.3   Detailed Results
                 In the following section we show the results of the competition from the benchmark’s perspective. For a
                 given benchmark we would like to know: how many solvers solved it, what is the min and max time to
                 solve, what are the min and max size of the expressions produced, which solver solved the benchmark
                 the fastest, and which solver produced the smallest expression.
                     We represents the results per benchmarks in groups organized per tracks and categories. For in-
                 stance, Fig. 3 shows all benchmarks of the INV tracks (ﬁrst half in the upper ﬁgure, and second half
                 in the lower ﬁgure). The black bars show the range of the time to solve among the different solvers in
                 psuedo logarithmic scale (as indicated on the upper part of the y-axis). Inspect for instance benchmark
                 anpf-new.sl. The black bar indicates that the fastest solver to solve it used between 10 to 30 second,
                 and the slowest did not solve it within the given time bound (3600 second). The black number above
                 the black bar indicates the exact number of seconds (ﬂoor-rounded to the nearest second) it took the
                 slowest solver to solve a benchmark (and ∞ if at least one solver exceeded the time bound). Thus, we
                 can see that the slowest solver to solve array-new.sl took 167 seconds to solve it. The white number
                 at the lower part of the bar indicates the time of the fastest solver to solve that benchmark. Thus, we can
                 see that the fastest solver to solve anpf-new.sl required 21 second to do so, and the fastest solver to
                 solve array-new.sl took less than a second. The colored squares/rectangles next to the lower part of
                 the black bar, indicate which solvers were the fastest to solve that benchmark (according to the solvers’
                 legendatthetop). Here, fastest means in the same logarithmic scale as the absolute fastest solver. For in-
                 stance, we can see that ALCHEMIST-CS wasthefastesttosolveanpf-new.sl,thatboth ALCHEMIST-CS
                 and ICE-DT solved cegar-new.sl in less than a second, and that all solvers (ICE-DT,ALCHEMIST-CS,
                 and CVC4-1.5-SYGUS)solved dec-new.sl in less than a second.
                     Similarly, the gray bars indicate the range of expression sizes in psuedo logarithmic scales (as in-
                 dicated on the lower part of the y-axis), where the size of an expression is determined by the number
                 of nodes in its parse tree. The black number at the bottom of the gray bar indicates the exact size ex-
                 pression of the largest solution (or ∞ if it exceeded 1000), and the white number at the top of the gray
                 bar indicates the exact size expression of the smallest solution. The colored squares/rectangles next to
                 the upper part of the gray bar indicates which solvers (according to the legend) produced the smallest
                 expression (where smallest means in the same logarithmic scale as the absolute smallest expression). For
                 instance, for tacas.sl the smallest expression produced had size 7, the biggest expression had size 121,
                 and the solver which produced the smallest expression is CVC4-1.5-SYGUS. For treax1.sl all solvers
                 produced an expression of size smaller than 10, and the absolute value of the smallest expression was 7.
                     Finally, at the top of the ﬁgure above each benchmark there is a number indicating the number
                 of solvers that solved that benchmark. For instance, one solver solved anpf-new.sl, two solvers
