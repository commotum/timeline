                    Wenotethatmultipleunknownfunctionscanbetheoretically represented as a single unknown func-
                 tion by taking the union of respective grammars of the functions and adding a new Start non-terminal.
                 But, we still distinguish benchmarks into different categories based on number of unknown functions as
                 somesolvers might exploit the additional structural information present in the benchmarks.
                 Speciﬁcation Constraint  Since the speciﬁcation language for the SyGuS-IF is based on constraints
                 and is therefore quite general, the speciﬁcation for different benchmarks can be deﬁned with varying
                 levels of completeness. We say a benchmark belongs to the partial spec class if the speciﬁcation con-
                 straint allows for multiple possible semantic solutions for the unkown functions. We say two functions
                 are semantically different if there exists some input for which they produce different outputs. For exam-
                 ple, the speciﬁcation for the icfp 7 10 benchmark is partial as it is speciﬁed using a set of input-output
                 examples. The speciﬁcation for the s8 benchmark shown above is also partial as it allows for multiple
                 possible functions f1, f2, and f3.

                 speciﬁcation of the unknown function is provided. For example, consider the speciﬁcation for the com-
                 piler optimization benchmark qm loop 1, where the constraint on the unknown function qm-loop fully
                 speciﬁes the result of the function for every input.
