Two Cortical Visual Systems

Damage to the primary visual cortex (striate cortex or area 17), either
by disease, by acute assault, or through surgical intervention for
therapeutic purposes, results in a scotoma or blind region in the visual
field. Moreover, because of the precise topographic mapping of the vi-
sual field onto striate cortex, the region of the scotoma corresponds to
the part of striate cortex damaged. In contrast to this primary sensory
impairment, “higher-order’’ visual dysfunctions ensue when damage oc-
curs more rostrally in the brain, in either the temporal or parietal lobes;
however, the effects that follow lesions of these two cortical areas are
markedly different (Newcombe and Russell 1969). Whereas damage to
temporal cortex produces an impairment in visual recognition (see, for
example, Milner 1958, 1968; Kimura 1963; Lansdell 1968; Benson et al.
1974; Meadows 1974), damage to parietal cortex produces a constellation
of visual spatial impairments (see, for example, McFie et al. 1950;
Semmes et al. 1963; De Renzi and Faglioni 1967; Butters et al. 1972;
Ratcliff and Davies-Jones 1972; Ratcliff and Newcombe 1973).
Although it is clear that visual information must reach the temporal
and parietal association areas to enable their participation in visual rec-
ognition and visual spatial perception, respectively, the complex cir-
cuitry through which this information is transmitted has yet to be un-
raveled. It is known, however, that two major fiber bundles emerge
from occipital cortex and project rostrally in the brain (Flechsig 1896,
1920). One, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, follows a dorsal path,
traversing the posterior parietal region in its course to the frontal lobe;
the other, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, follows a ventral route
into the temporal lobe. It has been our working hypothesis (Mishkin
1972; Pohl 1973) that the ventral or occipitotemporal pathway is
specialized for object perception (identifying what an object is) whereas
the dorsal or occipitoparietal pathway is specialized for spatial percep-
tion (locating where an object is). This distinction between the two
types of visual perception is not new (see, for example, Ingle 1967; Held
1968). In the past, however, the neural mechanisms underlying object
and spatial vision were seen as localized in geniculostriate and
tectofugal systems, respectively (Schneider 1967; Trevarthen 1968).
