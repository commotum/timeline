                 PaddedRolloutOperation. We compare the Padded Rollout Operation with different strategies for obtaining
                 image tokens: 1) Direct Unfold: directly unfolding the six planes into patches and concatenating them; 2)
                 Vertical Concat: vertically concatenating the six planes without aligning dimensions during the rollout process.
                 As shown in Tab. 5, Padded Rollout Operation (PRO) efÏciently models spatial and temporal relationships in
                 the token sequence, achieving optimal generation quality.
                 6 Conclusion
                 Wepresent DynamicCity, a framework for high-quality 4D occupancy generation that captures the temporal
                 dynamics of real-world environments. Our method introduces HexPlane, a compact 4D representation
                 generated using a VAE with a Projection Module, alongside an Expansion & Squeeze Strategy to enhance
                 reconstruction efÏciency and accuracy. Additionally, our Masked Rollout Operation reorganizes HexPlane
                 features for DiT-based diffusion, enabling versatile 4D scene generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
                 that DynamicCity surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction and generation, offering significant
                 improvements in quality, training speed, and memory efÏciency. DynamicCity paves the way for future research
                 in dynamic scene generation.
