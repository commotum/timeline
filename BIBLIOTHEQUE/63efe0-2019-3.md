# DREAMTOCONTROL: LEARNING BEHAVIORS BY LATENT IMAGINATION (2020)
Source: 63efe0-2019.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes Dreamer, a reinforcement learning agent that learns behaviors through latent imagination in a learned world model, changing how computation is performed for control.
- Uses imagined trajectories with analytic value gradients in latent dynamics to learn long-horizon behavior, which is a computation/learning mechanism rather than a positional encoding or dataset contribution.

## Evidence extracts
- "We present Dreamer, a reinforcement learning agent that solves long-horizon tasks from images purely by latent imagination. Weefﬁciently learn behaviors by propagating analytic gradients of learned state values back through trajectories imagined in the compact state space of a learned world model." (p. 1)
- "Training purely by imagination in a latent space lets us efﬁciently learn the policy by propagating analytic value gradients back through the latent dynamics." (p. 2)
