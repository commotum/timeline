# OccWorld: Learning a 3D Occupancy World Model for Autonomous Driving (2024)
Source: a9f875-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes OccWorld as a world model in 3D semantic occupancy space, positioning the contribution around modeling a higher-dimensional (3D) scene representation.
- Uses a GPT-like spatial-temporal generative transformer to forecast scene and ego evolution, showing a transformer adaptation for spatiotemporal (4D) world modeling rather than a 1D sequence-only setting.

## Evidence extracts
- "We propose OccWorld, a world model in the 3D semantic occupancy
space, to model the development of the driving scenes." (p. 2)
- "We then adopt a GPT-like spatial-
temporal generative transformer to generate subsequent scene and ego
tokens to decode the future occupancy and ego trajectory." (p. 2)
