# Component-based Synthesis Applied to Bitvector Programs (2010)
Source: 283918-2010.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper defines component-based program synthesis using logical specifications and straight-line program composition, which is a formal methods/program synthesis focus rather than ML modeling.
- The contributions center on constraint-based synthesis with first-order logic and SMT solving, not datasets, neural architectures, or positional encoding.

## Evidence extracts
- "We deﬁne component-based synthesis to be the problem of
synthesis of (straight-line) programs from appropriate com-
position of base components from a speciﬁed library of soft-" (Abstract)
- "∙ We present a novel technique for solving ﬁrst-order logic
constraints with quantiﬁer alternation using oﬀ-the-shelf
SMTsolvers (Section 6)." (Section 1 Introduction)
