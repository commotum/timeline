by conventional systems becomes excessive. The proposed system must
not only economize on storage space: it must be able to categorize
or identify an object "directly" -- i.e., it must locate the relevant

memories without resorting to a sequential search procedure,

Recent theoretical studies by this writer indicate that
it should be feasible to construct an electronic or electromechanical
system which will learn to recognize similarities or identities
between patterns of optical, electrical, or tonal information, in a
manner which may be closely analogous to the perceptual processes of
a biological brain. The proposed system depends on probabilistic
rather than deterministic principles for its operation, and gains its
reliability from the properties of statistical measurements obtained
from large populations of elements, A system which operates according
to these principles will be called a perceptron. A model which is
designed to accept optical, or "visual" patterns as inputs will be
called a photoperceptron. One which accepts tonal patterns, or
"auditory" inputs, will be designated a phonoperceptron, and we might
also consider the possibility of electro= or radioperceptrons, with
corresponding sensory devices, It is also useful to distinguish
between momentary stimulus perceptrons and temporal pattern perceptrons
- the latter having the ability to remember temporal sequencesof events,
rather than transient momentary images, such as would be obtained from

a collection of isolated frames cut from a strip of movie film.

The present discussion will concentrate on a momentary
stimulus photoperceptron, which seems to be the most elementary device
which could be built to demonstrate the general principles of this
type of system. It is suggested that the proposed model should be
built, not only to demonstrate the workability of the perceptron
concept, but as a research tool for further study of the principles
