# Dynamic Dopamine Modulation in the Basal Ganglia: A Neurocomputational Account of Cognitive Deficits in Medicated and Nonmedicated Parkinsonism (2005)
Source: 2345a5-2005.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper examines dopamine function in the basal ganglia and cognitive deficits in Parkinsonism, a cognitive neuroscience focus outside core ML categories.
- It frames the biological discussion via a neural network model of basal ganglia dynamics, serving as cross-disciplinary grounding.

## Evidence extracts
- "&Dopamine (DA) depletion in the basal ganglia (BG) of Parkinson’s patients gives rise to both frontal-like and implicit learning impairments." (p. 1)
- "are synthesized in a neural network model (Figure 3)." (p. 7)
