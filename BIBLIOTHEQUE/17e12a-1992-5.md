# TD-Gammon, A Self-Teaching Backgammon Program, Achieves Master-Level Play (1993)
Source: 17e12a-1992.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper describes a neural network that learns backgammon by self-play using the TD(A) reinforcement learning algorithm.
- It presents a case study applying the TD reinforcement learning algorithm to train a multilayer neural network for backgammon strategy, emphasizing training methodology and performance.

## Evidence extracts
- "Abstract.  TD-Gammon is  a  neural  network  that  is  able  to  teach
itself    to  play backgammon solely  by playing  against  itself  and learning
from the  results,       based on the  TD(A) reinforcement  learning  algorithm
(Sutton,  1988)." (p. 1)
- "This  paper  presents  a  case  study  in  which the  TD()~) reinforcement  learn-
ing  algorithm  (Sutton,  1988)  was applied  to  training  a  multilayer  neural  net-
work on  a  complex  task:           learning      strategies        for  the  game of  backgammon." (p. 1)
