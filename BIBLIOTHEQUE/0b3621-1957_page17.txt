performance. If the sets responding to different stimuli each represent
a small fraction of the total number of A-units, then the interaction
will be small, and the probability of interference between different
associations will be slight, since the random biases introduced will
tend to cancel one another and can easily be overcome by the value-gain
which is concentrated in the correct subset. Appendix II contains an
illustrative example of the process by which associations are formed,

in a system with 6); A-units.

At this point, we should note that while the communality
between subsets has cost us a penalty of interference between associations,
it has gained something far more important. For if we were to design a
system of, say, 100 A-units, in which sets of 10 units respond to every
stimulus, and if we were to insist that there be no communality between
sets, then we would be limited to a total of only ten stimuli which the
system might distinguish. If, on the other hand, we admit an expected
communality of 10%, the limiting number of stimuli which the system
might identify becomes equal to the number of combinations of 100 things
taken ten at a time -- a total of 1.73 x 10! possible combinations.

This number, however, should not be taken to indicate the practical
capacity of the system, because long before this number of associations
has been learned, the system will have been"saturated", in the sense that
the expected loss of previously acquired associations (through interaction
effects) will exactly balance the expected gain of new associations. As
this equilibrium condition is approached, it will become harder and hard~
er to "teach" the system new associations without knocking out old ones,
and if we try to re-establish the old ones, we will find that we have

lost others in the process.

A more useful criterion for the capacity of the system

is the probability that a stimulus which has been associated to one of

two responses will retain its proper "preference" after the system has
