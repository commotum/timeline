# Repeated examples help learn arithmetic (2024)
Source: ad5e9b-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper investigates how repeating training examples affects transformer performance on arithmetic tasks, which is a training-method contribution rather than a new positional encoding or domain adaptation.
- It centers on training data regimes with repeated examples (vs. unlimited data) to improve learning outcomes, aligning with ML foundations and training principles.

## Evidence extracts
- "on a limited set of repeated examples achieve better performance than models trained from unlimited data." (p. 1)
- "Ourfindingsindicate that the performance of math transformers can be greatly improved by training them on datasets which include repeated examples." (p. 4)
