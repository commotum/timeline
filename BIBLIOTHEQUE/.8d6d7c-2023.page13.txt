                                     C Qualitative Comparison(LiDAR-onlyvs. Fusion)
                                     Figures 7 and 8 provide a qualitative comparison of our proposed method with the LiDAR-only
                                     baseline (Tab. 4, row 1 in the main text). We provide the segmentation results in the LiDAR domain
                                     for both LiDAR-onlyandfusionmodelsinthefirsttwocolumns,respectively,andthecorresponding
                                     camera view in the third column. The region of interest in each case is highlighted in red.
                                     In the first example (Fig. 7), the baseline wrongly segments the building at range as vegetation due
                                     to the limited information obtained from the LiDAR input. By contrast, the final model with fusion
                                     effectively leverages the rich contextual information from the camera (highlighted by the red box)
                                     and segments the correct class.
                                     In the second example (Fig. 8), the baseline fails to track pedestrians when they are close to each
                                     other (the two pedestrians on the left are merged together as a single instance). By contrast, the

                                     segment and track them.
