                             Discussion. In this problem, the model is being asked to provide TYPE_CHECKING basedhandling
                             for resolving cyclic imports, which pylint currently throws an error for. The gold patch has a detailed
                             solution that involves conditional handling within the TYPE_CHECKING block, excludes the cyclic
                             import messages, and has generally more specific handling. The model generated patch employs a
                             “Stack Overlow” like solution; while creating a  TYPE_CHECKING block is a popular solution for
                             resolving imports, solving this issue for the codebase in particular requires a more nuanced solution
                             than a general answer that may be available online.
