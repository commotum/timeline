3. Probability of Correct Discrimination (P3):

Ps = the area under the normal curve from —co to +Z, where

the ordinate, Z, is given by the exoression:

2G 6)

and

tg
a

expected proportion of A-units responding to random
stimuli (assuming a fixed or mean size for all S-sets)
(Equations 1 and 2)

bar}
i

number of Aeunits in the subset activated by a particular

stimlus and transmitting to a particular response

=
u

5 number of stimuli associated to each of the responses
under comparison (assuming an equal degree of saturation

for both responses)

This equation makes the assumption that all stimuli learned
are of the same size -- i.e., that Po remains constant. It also assumes
that an equal number of stimuli have been associated to each response,
with a fixed amount of reinforcement for each association formed. An
equation which relaxes these restrictions has not been developed, but
Monte Carlo studies are being planned to investigate the importance of
the assumptions, An additional assumption, for which corrections can

readily be made, is that Ng will be cosiderably greater than 1,
