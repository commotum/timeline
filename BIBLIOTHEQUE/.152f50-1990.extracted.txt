            Working memory is the term applied by cognitive                  (Goldman-Rakic,  1987).  The  ability  to  keep  the 
            psychologists and theorists to the type of memory                location of an object  “in  mind”  is not unlike the 
            that  is active and relevant only for a short  period            ability  of  humans  to  keep a  phone  number  or a

            (Squire and  Cohen,  1984), all of  which have in                the need to update information  on every trial. The 
            common that their contents are, for all intents and              correct response on trial n is not predictive for the 
            purposes, stable over time (e.g., someone’s name,                correct  response  on  trial  n  +  1.  The  lack  of  a

            response task. Upper panel displays a neuron that exhibits aphasic  response on appearance  of the target; over 90% of such neurons 
            are directionally selective; i.e.,  discharge selectively to a specific, usually contralateral,  target location.  The middle panel displays 
            tonic activity during the delay period; in most prefrontal neurons  displaying this activity, the activity is also directionally selective. 
            The lower panel displays a neuron that  is activated at the time of response; some oculomotor  reponses occur before the  response, 
            but most occur after the response is initiated (Funahashi  et al.,  1990b). These responses are time-locked  to the main events (cue, 
            delay and response) of the ODR task.

            evidence of  dynamic interactions  among  several

            the  directional bias  of  the  phasic  “C”  response 
            and the cell’s tonic  “D”  activity are highly cor-
