                        As  an important  application  of these ideas, suppose that                                                     R,  =  1.  Here  however,  it  may  be  seen  that  achieving 
                    we wish  to  send a random  process  U  =  {U,,: n  =  1,2, * * . }                                                 (R,,R,)         =  (1,l)  implies  RI2  =  1. Thus  the  messages sent 
                    to  receiver  1 and  a random  process  I’  =  {V,,: n  =  1,2, * * * }                                            to  1 and 2 must  be maximally  dependent,  and in  fact  equal.
