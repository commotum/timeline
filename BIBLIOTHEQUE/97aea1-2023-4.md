# Segment Anything (2023)
Source: 97aea1-2023.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper’s primary deliverable is the SA-1B dataset, which the authors build with a model-in-the-loop data engine to collect 1.1 billion segmentation masks over 11 million licensed, high-resolution images.
- SA-1B dwarfs prior segmentation benchmarks (11× more images and 400× more masks than the next-largest dataset) and is being released to the community to spur future foundation-model research.

## Evidence extracts
- "Our dataset, SA-1B, consists of 11M diverse, high-resolution, licensed, and privacy protecting images and 1.1B high-quality segmentation masks collected with our data engine. We compare SA-1B with existing datasets and analyze mask quality and properties. We are releasing SA-1B to aid future development of foundation models for computer vision." (p. 4020)
- "SA-1B has 11x more images and 400x more masks than the second largest, Open Images. On average, it has 36x more masks per image than Open Images. The closest dataset in this respect, ADE20K, still has 3.5x fewer masks per image." (p. 4020)
