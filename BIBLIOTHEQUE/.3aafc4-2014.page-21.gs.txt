                   Nowlet B be an L×L square of pixels, located anywhere on the n×n grid. Let a (B) be the
                                                                                                   t
               number of cream particles in B after t steps. Clearly
                                                   a (B) = X a (x,y).                                     (11)
                                                    t              t
                                                           (x,y)∈B
                                                           2
               So it follows from Claim 1 that E[a (B)] ≤ L .
                                                  t
                   Fix some constant G, say 10. Then call B “bad” if a (B) diﬀers from E[a (B)] by more than
                                                                      t                    t
               L2/G. Suppose that at some time step t, no B is bad. Also, suppose we form a coarse-grained
               image by coloring each B one of G shades of gray, depending on the value of
                                                         a (B)G
                                                            t                                             (12)
                                                               2
                                                             L
               (or we color B white if a (B) > L2). Then it’s clear that the resulting image will be correctable,
                                       t
               by adjusting each color by ±1, to one where all the B’s within the same row are assigned the same
               color—and furthermore, that color is simply
                                                       E[a (B)]G
                                                            t         .                                   (13)
                                                             L2
               If this happens, though, then the Kolmogorov complexity of the coarse-grained image can be at
               most log2(n) + log2(t) + O(1).    For once we’ve speciﬁed n and t, we can simply calculate the
               expected color for each B, and no color ever deviates from its expectation.
                   So our task reduces to upper-bounding the probability that B is bad.  By a Chernoﬀ bound,
               since a (B) is just a sum of independent, 0/1 random variables,
                      t
                                                                             E[a (B)]δ2
                                Pr[|a (B)−E[a (B)]| > δE[a (B)]] < 2exp −          t         .            (14)
                                     t          t             t                     3
               Plugging in L2/G = δE[at(B)], we get
                                                           L2                 L4      
                                  Pr |a (B)−E[a (B)]| >         <2exp −                    .              (15)
                                        t          t        G              3G2E[a (B)]
                                                                                   t
                                  2
               Since E[a (B)] ≤ L from above, this in turn is at most
                         t
                                                       2exp− L2 .                                       (16)
                                                                3G2
               Now, provided we choose a coarse-grain size
                                                    p        2       p       

               the above will be much less than 1/n2. In that case, it follows by the union bound that, at each
               time step t, with high probability none of the L × L squares B are bad (since there at most n2
               such squares). This is what we wanted to show.
