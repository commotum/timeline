                               Discussion. For this task instance that comes from the django/django repository, the model is asked
                               to introduce a context variable that would allow a user to hide the “Save and Add Another” button
                               via a context variable, similar to how it is done for two other existing buttons. The task is a bit
                               more difficult compared to the prior two settings because no explicit stack trace or programmatic
                               demonstration of the issue is offered. In this relatively under-specified setting that does not provide
                               suggestion with regards to localizing the function correctly, the model successfully reasons that it
                               should adjust the existing    show_save_and_add_another key/value pair. When comparing the
                               gold patch solution, it can be argued that the model generated patch produces a much more efficient
                               solution in terms of lines edited, as it makes the smallest edit necessary to incorporate        context
                               as a flag for setting the   show_save_and_add_another hidden status. However, similar to the
                               discussioninTable31,stylistically, the gold patch edits are much more consistent with the codebase,
                               and additional changes that are not explicitly discussed in the issue are also made to adhere to what
                               has been done in the codebase (i.e. the addition of a           can_save_and_add_another field
                               .  This task is an example of a potentially exciting direction where via human guidance or better
                               understanding of a codebase in general, models would then adjust their generations to not just make
                               the functionally correct changes, but also the stylistically right ones, too.
