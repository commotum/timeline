(1) “Latent Learning” Experiments.
The first of the latent learning experi-
ments was performed at Berkeley by
Blodgett, It was published in 1929,
Blodgett not only performed the experi-
ments, he. also originated the concept.
He ran three groups of rats through a
six-unit alley maze, shown in Fig, 4,
He had a control group and two ex-
perimental groups. ‘The error curves for
these groups appear in Fig, 5, The
solid line shows the error curve for
Group I, the control group. These ani-
mals were run in orthodox fashion.
That is, they were run one trial a day
and found food in the goal-box at the
end of each trial. Groups II and III
were the experimental groups. ‘The ani-
mals of Group II, the dash line, were
not fed in the maze for the first six
days but only in their home cages some
' two hours later, On the seventh day
(indicated by the small cross) the rats
found food at the end of the maze for

the first time and continued to find it
on subsequent days. The animals of
Group III were treated similarly except
that they first found food at the end
of the maze on the third day and con-
tinued to find it there on subsequent
days. It will be observed that the ex-
perimental groups as long as they were
not finding food did not appear to learn
much. (Their error curves did not
drop.) But on the days immediately
succeeding their first finding of the food
their error curves did drop astound-
ingly. It appeared, in short, that dur-
ing the non-rewarded trials these ani-
mals had been learning much more than
they had exhibited. This learning,
which did not manifest itself until after
the food had been introduced, Blodgett
called “latent learning.” Interpreting
these results anthropomorphically, we
would say that as long as the animals
were not getting any food at the end of
the maze they continued to take their

time in going through it—they con-
tinued to enter many blinds. Once,
however, they knew they were to get
food, they demonstrated that during
these preceding non-rewarded trials they
had learned where many of the blinds
were. They had been building up a
‘map,’ and could utilize the latter as
soon as they were motivated to do so.
Honzik and myself repeated the ex-
periments (or rather he did and I got
some of the credit) with the 14-unit
T-mazes shown in Fig. 1, and with

larger groups of animals, and got similar’

results. The resulting curves are shown
in Fig. 6. We used two control groups
—one that never found food in the
maze (HNR) and one that found it
throughout (HR). The experimental
group (HNR-R) found food at the end
of the maze from the 11th day on and
showed the same sort of a sudden drop.

But probably the best experiment
demonstrating latent learning was, un-
fortunately, done not in Berkeley but at
the University of Iowa, by Spence and
Lippitt. Only an abstract of this ex-
periment has as yet been published.
However, Spence has sent a preliminary
manuscript from which the following
account is summarized. A simple Y-
maze (see Fig. 7) with two goal-boxes
was used. Water was at the end of the
right arm of the Y and food at the end
of the left arm. During the training
period the rats were run neither hun-
gry nor thirsty. They were satiated for
both food and water before each day’s
trials. However, they were willing to
run because after each run they were
taken out of whichever end box they
had got to and put into a living cage,
with other animals in it. They were
given four trials a day in this fashion
