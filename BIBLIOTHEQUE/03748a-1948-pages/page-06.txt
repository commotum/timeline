(actually done by Geier and Levin)
using this same visual discrimination
apparatus, it was found that with one
and the same difficulty of problem the
smarter animal did the more VTEing.

To sum up, in visual discrimination
experiments the better the learning, the
more the VYE’s. But this seems con-
trary to what we would perhaps have
expected. We ourselves would expect
to do more VIEing, more sampling of
the two stimuli, when it is difficult to
choose between them than when it is
easy.

What is the explanation? ‘The an-
swer lies, I believe, in the fact that the

’ manner in which we set the visual dis-

crimination problems for the rats and
the manner in which we set similar
problems for ourselves are different.
We already have our ‘instructions.’ We
know beforehand what it is we are to
do. We are told, or we tell ourselves,
that it is the lighter of the two grays,
the heavier of the two weights, or the
like, which is to be chosen. In such a
setting we do more sampling, more
VTEing, when the stimulus-difference is
small, But for the rats the usual prob-
lem in a discrimination apparatus is
quite different. They do not know
what is wanted of them, The major
part of their learning in most such ex-
periments seems to consist in their dis-

covering the instructions. The rats
have to discover that it is the differ-
ences in visual brightness, not the dif-
ferences between left and right, which
they are to pay attention to. Their
VTEing appears when they begin to
‘catch on.’ The preater the difference
between the two stimuli the more the
animals are attracted by this difference.
Hence the sooner they catch on, and
during this catching on, the more they
VTE.

That this is a reasonable interpreta-
tion appeared further, from an experi-
ment by myself and Minium (the actual
work done, of course, by Minium) in
which a group of six rats was first
taught a white vs. black discrimination,
then two successively more difficult gray

vs. black discriminations. For each
difficulty the rats were given a long se-
ries of further trials beyond the points
at which they had learned. Comparing

_the beginning of each of these three

difficulties the results were that the rats
did more VTEing for the easy discrimi-
nations than for the more difficult ones.
When, however, it came to a compari-
son of amounts of VTEing during the
final performance after each learning
had reached a plateau, the opposite re-
sults were obtained. In other words, .
after the rats had finally divined their |
instructions, then they, like human |
beings, did more VTEing, more sam-
pling, the more difficult the discrimina-
tion.
Finally, now let us note that it was
