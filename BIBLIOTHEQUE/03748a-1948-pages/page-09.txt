and ran across the circular table into
the alley and found themselves blocked.
' They then returned onto the table and
began exploring practically all the radi-
ating paths. After going out a few
inches only on any one path, each rat
finally chose to run all the way out on
one. The percentages of rats finally
choosing each of the long paths from 1
to 12 are shown in Fig. 17. It appears

that there was a preponderant tendency
to choose path No, 6 which ran to a
point some four inches in front of where
the entrance to the food-box had been.
The only other path chosen with any
appreciable frequency was No. 1—that
is, the path which pointed perpendicu-
larly to the food-side of the room.
These results seem to indicate that

the rats in this experiment had learned
not only to run rapidly down the origi-
nal roundabout route but also, when this
was blocked and radiating paths pre-
sented, to select one pointing rather di-
rectly towards the point where the food
had been or else at least to select a path
running perpendicularly to the food-
side of the room.

As a result of their original training,
the rats had, it would seem, acquired
not merely a strip-map to the effect that
the original specifically trained-on path
led to food but, rather, a wider compre-
hensive map to the effect that food was
located in such and such a direction in
the room.

Consider now a further experiment
done by Ritchie alone. This experiment
tested still further the breadth of the
spatial map which is acquired. In this
further experiment the rats were again
run across the table—this time to the
arms of a simple T. (See Fig. 18.)

Twenty-five animals were trained for
seven days, 20 trials in all, to find food
at F,; and twenty-five animals were
trained to find it at Fo. The L’s in the
diagram indicate lights. On the eighth
day the starting path and table top

were rotated through 180 degrees so.

that they were now in the position
shown in Fig. 19. The dotted lines

ries of radiating paths was added.
What happened? Again the rats ran
across the table into the central alley.
When, however, they found themselves
blocked, they turned back onto the
table and this time also spent many
seconds touching and trying out for
only a few steps practically all the
paths, Finally, however, within seven
minutes, 42 of the 50 rats chose one
path and ran all the way out on it.
‘The paths finally chosen by the 19 of
these animals that had been fed at Fy
and by the 23 that had been fed at Fo
are shown in Fig. 20,

This time the rats tended to choose,
not the paths which pointed directly to
the spots where the food had been, but
rather paths which ran perpendicularly
to the corresponding sides of the room.
The spatial maps of these rats, when
the animals were started from the op-
posite side of the room, were thus not
completely adequate to the precise goal
positions but were adequate as to the
correct sides of the room. The maps of
these animals were, in short, not alto-
gether strip-like and narrow.

This completes my report of experi-
ments. There were the latent learning
experiments, the VTE experiments, the
Searching for the stimulus experiment,
the hypothesis experiments, and these
last spatial orientation experiments.

And now, at last, I come to the hu-
manly significant and exciting problem:
namely, what are the conditions which
favor narrow strip-maps and what are
those which tend to favor broad com-
prehensive maps not only in rats but
also in mene

There is considerable evidence scat-
tered throughout the literature bearing
on this question both for rats and for
men. Some of this evidence was ob-
tained in Berkeley and some of it else-
where. I have not time to present it in
any detail. I can merely summarize it
by saying that narrow strip maps rather
than broad comprehensive maps seem
to be induced: (1) by a damaged brain,
(2) by an inadequate array of environ-
mentally presented cues, (3) by an
