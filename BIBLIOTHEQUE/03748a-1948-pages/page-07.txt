also found at Berkeley by Jackson *
that in a maze the difficult maze units
produce more VTEing and also that the
more stupid rats do the more VTEing.
The explanation, as I see it, is that, in
the case of mazes, rats know their in-
structions. For them it is natural to
expect, that the same spatial path will
always lead to the same outcome. Rats
in mazes don’t have to be told,

But what, now, is the final signifi-
cance of all this VIEing? How do
these facts about VTEing affect our
theoretical argument? My answer is
that these facts lend further support to
the doctrine of a building up of maps.
VTEing, as I see it, is evidence that in
the critical stages—whether in the first
picking up of the instructions or in the
later making sure of which stimulus is
which—the animal’s activity is not just
one of responding passively to discrete
stimuli, but rather one of the active se-

brings me then to the third type of ex-
periment.

refer to a recent, and it seems to me ex-
tremely important experiment, done for
a Ph.D, dissertation by Hudson. Hud-
son was first interested in the question
of whether or not rats could learn an
avoidance reaction in one trial. His
animals were tested one at a time in a
living cage (see Fig. 13) with a small
striped visual pattern at the end, on
which was mounted a foed cup. The

hungry rat approached this food cup |

and ate. An electrical arrangement was
provided so that when the rat touched
the cup he could be given an electric
shock, And one such shock did appear
to be enough. For when the rat was
replaced in this same cage days or even
weeks afterwards, he usually demon-
strated immediately strong avoidance
reactions to the visual pattern. ‘The
animal withdrew from that end of the

cage, or piled up sawdust and covered
the pattern, or showed various other
amusing responses all of which were in
the nature of withdrawing from the
pattern or making it disappear.

But the particular finding which I
am interested in now appeared as a re-
sult of a modification of this standard
procedure. Hudson noticed that the
animals, anthropomorphically speaking,
often seemed to look around after the
shock to see what it was that had hit
them. Hence it occurred to him that,
if the pattern were made to disappear
the instant the shock occurred, the rats
might not establish the association.
And this indeed is what happened in
the case of many individuals. Hudson
added further electrical connections so
that when the shock was received dur-
ing the eating, the lights went out, the

pattern and the food cup dropped out
of sight, and the lights came on again
all within the matter of a second.
When such animals were again put in
the cage 24 hours later, a large per-
centage showed no avoidance of the

pattern. Or to quote Hudson’s own
words:
“Learning what object to avoid ... may

occur exclusively during the period after
the shock. For if the object from which
the shock was actually received is re-
moved at the moment of the shock, a sig-
nificant number of animals fail to learn to
avoid it, some selecting other features in
the environment for avoidance, and others
avoiding nothing.”

In other words, I feel that this ex-
periment reinforces the notion of the
largely active selective character in the
rat’s building up of his cognitive map.
He often has to look actively for the
significant stimuli in order to form his
map and does not merely passively re-
ceive and react to all the stimuli which
are physically present.

Turn now to the fourth type of ex-
periment.

(4) The “Hypothesis” Experiments.
Both the notion of hypotheses in rats
and the design of the experiments to
demonstrate such hypotheses are to be
credited to Krech. Krech used a four-
compartment discrimination-box. In
such a four-choice box the correct door
at each choice-point may be determined
by the experimenter in terms of its
being lighted or dark, left or right, or
various combinations of these. If all
