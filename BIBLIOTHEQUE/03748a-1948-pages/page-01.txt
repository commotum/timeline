THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW

COGNITIVE MAPS IN RATS AND MEN’

BY EDWARD C. TOLMAN

University of California

I shall devote the body of this paper
to a description of experiments with
rats. But I shall also attempt in a few
words at the close to indicate the sig-
nificance. of. these findings on‘ rats for
the: clinical behavior of men. Most of
the rat investigations, which FT shall re-
port, were carried out in the: Berkeley
laboratory. But I shall also include,
occasionally, accounts of the behavior
of non-Berkeley rats who obviously
have misspent their lives in out-of-
State laboratories. Furthermore, in re-

porting our Berkeley. experiments I.

shall have to omit a very great many,
The ones I shail talk about’ were :car-
ried out by graduate students (or un-

derpaid research assistants) who, sup-

posedly, got some of their ideas from
me, And a few, though a very. few,
were even carried out -by me myself. .
Let me begin by presenting diagrams
for a couple of typical ’ inazés, an alley

‘The results are usually presented in the

form of average curves of blind-en-
trances, or of seconds from start to
finish, for groups of rats.

All students agree-as to the facts.
They disagree, however, on theory and
explanation.

(1) First, there is a school of ani-
mal psychologists which believes that

: the maze behavior of rats is a matter of

mere simple stimulus-response connec-
tions. Learning, according to them,
consists in the strengthening of some of
these connections and in the weakening
According. to this ‘stimulus-
response’ school the rat in progressing

to a succession of external stimuli—
sights, sounds, smells, pressures, etc.
impinging upon his external sense or-
gans—plus internal stimuli coming from
the viscera and from the skeletal muscles.
These external and internal stimuli call
out the walkings, runnings, turnings, re-
tracings, smellings, rearings, and the
like which appear. The rat’s central
