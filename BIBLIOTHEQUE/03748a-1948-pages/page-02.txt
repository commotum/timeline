nervous system, according to this view,
may be likened to a complicated tele-
phone switchboard. There are the in-
coming calls from sense-organs and
there are the outgoing messages to
muscles, Before the learning of a spe-
cific maze, the connecting switches
(synapses according to the physiologist)
are closed in one set of ways and pro-
duce the primarily exploratory responses
which appear in the early trials. Learn-
ing, according to this view, consists in
the respective strengthening and weak-
ening of various of these connections;
those connections which result in the
animal’s going down the true path be-
come relatively more open to the pas-

sage of nervous impulses, whereas those
which lead him into the blinds become
relatively less open. !

It must be noted in addition, how-
ever, that this stimulus-response school
divides further into two subgroups.

(a) There is a subgroup which holds
that the mere mechanics involved in the
running of a maze is such that the
crucial stimuli from the maze get pre-
sented simultaneously with the correct
responses more frequently than they do
with any of the incorrect responses.
Hence, just on a basis of this greater
frequency, the neural connections be-
tween the crucial stimuli and the cor-
rect responses will tend, it is said, to

get strengthened at the expense of the
incorrect connections.

(b) There is a second subgroup in
this stimulus-response school which
holds that the reason the appropriate
connections get strengthened relatively
to the inappropriate ones is, rather, the
fact that the responses resulting from
the correct connections are followed
more closely in time by need-reductions.
Thus a hungry rat in a maze tends to
get to food and have his hunger re-
duced sooner as a result of the true path
responses than as a result of the blind
alley responses. And such immediately

following need-reductions or, to use an-
other term, such ‘positive reinforce-
ments’ tend somehow, it is said, to
strengthen the connections which have
most closely preceded them. Thus it
is as if—although this is certainly not
the way this subgroup would themselves
state it—the satisfaction-receiving part
of the rat telephoned back to Central
and said to the girl: “Hold that con-
nection; it was good; and see to it that
you blankety-blank well use it again
the next time these same stimuli come
in.” ‘These theorists also assume (at
least some of them do some of the
