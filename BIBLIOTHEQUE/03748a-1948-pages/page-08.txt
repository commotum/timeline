possibilities are randomized for the 40
choices made in 10 runs of each day’s
test, the problem could be made in-
soluble.
When this was done, Krech found
/ that the individual rat went through a
succession of systematic choices. That
is, the individual animal might perhaps
begin by choosing practically all right-
hand doors, then he might give this up
for choosing practically all left-hand
| doors, and then, for choosing all dark
doors, and so on, These relatively
persistent, and well-above-chance sys-
tematic types of choice Krech called

“hypotheses.” In using this term he
obviously did not mean to imply verbal
processes in the rat but merely referred
to what I have been calling cognitive
maps which, it appears from his experi-
ments, get set up in a tentative fashion
to be tried out first one and then an-
other until, if possible, one is found
which works.

Finally, it is to be noted that these
hypothesis experiments, like the latent
learning, VTE, and “looking for the
stimulus” experiments, do not, as such,
throw light upon the widths of the maps
which are picked up but do indicate

the generally map-like and self-initiated
character of learning,

For the beginning of an attack upon
the problem of the width of the maps
let me turn to the last group of experi-
ments,

(5) “Spatial Orientation” Expert-
ments. As early as 1929, Lashley re-
ported incidentally the case of a couple
of his rats who, after having learned an
alley maze, pushed back the cover near
the starting box, climbed out and ran
directly across the top to the goal-box
where they climbed down in again and
ate. Other investigators have reported
related findings. All such observations
suggest that rats really develop wider
spatial maps which include more than
the mere trained-on specific paths. In
the experiments now to be reported this

possibility has been subjected to fur-
ther examination.
In the first experiment, Tolman,

, Ritchie and Kalish (actually Ritchie

and Kalish) used the set-up shown in
Fig. 15.

This was an elevated maze. The ani-
mals ran from A across the open circu-
lar table through CD (which had alley
walls) and finally to G, the food box.
H was a light which shone directly down
the path from G to F. After four
nights, three trials per night, in which
the rats learned to run directly and
without hesitation from A to G, the
apparatus was changed to the sun-burst
shown in Fig. 16. The starting path
and the table remained the same but a
series of radiating paths was added.

The animals were again started at A
