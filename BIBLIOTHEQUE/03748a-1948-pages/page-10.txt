Cocnitive Maps in Rats AND Men 207

overdose of repetitions on the original
trained-on path and (4) by the pres-
ence of too strongly motivational or of
too strongly frustrating conditions.

It is this fourth factor which I wish
to elaborate upon briefly in my conclud-
ing remarks. For it is going to be
my contention that some, at least, of
the so-called ‘psychological mechanisms?
which the clinical psychologists and the
other students of personality have un-

. covered as the devils underlying many

of our individual and social maladjust-
ments can be interpreted as narrowings
of our cognitive maps due to too strong
motivations or to too intense frustra-
tion.

My argument will be brief, cavalier,
and dogmatic. For I am not myself a
clinician or a social psychologist. What
I am going to say must be considered,
therefore, simply as in the nature of a
raé psychologist’s ratiocinations offered
free.

By way of illustration, let me sug-
gest that at least the three dynamisms
called, respectively, “regression,” “fixa-
tion,” and “displacement of aggression
onto outgroups” are expressions of cog-
nitive maps which are too narrow and
which get built up in us as a result of
too violent motivation or of too intense
frustration,

(a) Consider regression, This is the
term used for those cases in which an
individual, in the face of too difficult a
problem, returns to earlier more child-
ish ways of behaving. Thus, to take an
example, the overprotected middle-aged
woman (reported a couple of years ago
in Time Magazine) who, after losing
her husband, regressed (much to the
distress of her growing daughters) into
dressing in too youthful a fashion and
into competing for their beaux and then
finally into behaving like a child re-
quiring continuous care, would be an
illustration of regression. I would not
wish you to put too much confidence

in the reportorial accuracy of Time, but
such an extreme case is not too different
from many actually to be found in our
mental hospitals or even sometimes in
ourselves, In all such instances my
argument’ would be (1) that such re-
gression results from too strong a pres-
ent emotional situation and (2) that it
consists in going back to too narrow an
earlier map, itself due to too much frus-
tration or motivation in early childhood. ;
Time’s middle-aged woman was pre-
sented by too frustrating an emotional
situation at her husband’s death and
she regressed, I would wager, to too
narrow adolescent and childhood maps
since these latter had been originally
excessively impressed because of over-
stressful experiences at the time she was
growing up.

(b) Consider fixation. Regression
and fixation tend to go hand in hand.
For another way of stating the fact of
the undue persistence of early maps is
to say that they were fixated. This has
even been demonstrated in rats, If
rats are too strongly motivated in their
original learning, they find it very diffi-
cult to relearn when the original path is
no longer correct. Also after they have
relearned, if they are given an electric
shock they, like Tine’s woman, tend to
regress back again to choosing the
earlier path.

(c) Finally, consider the “displace-
ment of aggressions onto outgroups.”
Adherence to one’s own group is an
ever-present tendency among primates.
It is found in chimpanzees and mon-
keys as strongly as in men. We pri-
mates operate in groups. And each
individual in such a group tends to
identify with his whole group in the
sense that the group’s goals become his
goals, the group’s life and immortality,
his life and immortality. Furthermore, °
each individual soon learns that, when
as an individual he is frustrated, he
must not take out his aggressions on
