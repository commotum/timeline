- Specifies the ARC dataset structure with fixed training and evaluation task counts, indicating a benchmark/dataset resource.

## Evidence extracts
- "Finally, we present a new benchmark closely following these guidelines, the AbstractionandReasoningCorpus(ARC),builtuponanexplicitsetofpriorsdesignedtobeascloseaspossible to innate human priors." (Abstract)
- "Thetraining set features 400 tasks,while the evaluation set features 600 tasks." (Section III.1.1 What is ARC?)
