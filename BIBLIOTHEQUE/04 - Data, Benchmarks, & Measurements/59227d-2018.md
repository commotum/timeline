# ListOps: A Diagnostic Dataset for Latent Tree Learning (2018)
Source: 59227d-2018.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces ListOps as a new toy dataset and diagnostic tool for evaluating parsing ability, making the dataset the main contribution.
- Provides dataset details (train/test sizes), reinforcing that the paper contributes a benchmark resource rather than a new model mechanism.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper we introduce ListOps, a new toy dataset that can be used as a diagnostic tool to study the parsing ability of latent tree learning models." (p. 7)
- "The ListOps dataset used in this paper has 90k training examples and 10k test examples." (p. 4)
