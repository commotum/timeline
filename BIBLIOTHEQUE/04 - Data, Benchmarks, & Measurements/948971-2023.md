# Objaverse-XL: A Universe of 10M+ 3D Objects (2023)
Source: 948971-2023.pdf

## Core reasons
- Objaverse-XL is introduced as a web-crawled collection of over 10 million 3D assets and the paper builds its narrative around meeting the urgent need for large-scale 3D data, making the dataset itself the main deliverable.
- The supplementary datasheet documents the motivation, composition, and uses for Objaverse-XL, reinforcing that this work is primarily about providing a large-scale benchmark resource rather than proposing a new model.

## Evidence extracts
- "We introduce Objaverse-XL, a large-scale, web-crawled dataset of 3D assets. Advances in 3D authoring tools, demand, and photogrammetry, have substantially increased the amount of 3D data on the Internet. This data is spread across numerous locations including software hosting services like Github, specialized sites for 3D assets like Sketchfab, 3D printing asset sources like Thingiverse, 3D scanning platforms like Polycam, and specialized sites like the Smithsonian Institute. Objaverse-XL crawls such sources for 3D objects, providing a significantly richer variety and quality of 3D data than previously available, see Figure 1. Overall, Objaverse-XL comprises of over 10 million 3D objects, representing an order of magnitude more data than the recently proposed Objaverse 1.0 [14] and is two orders of magnitude larger than ShapeNet." (Section 1)
- "The Objaverse-XL dataset was created to address the lack of high-quality, large-scale datasets for 3D vision tasks. This was due to challenges in acquiring such data and the associated complexities of 3D object generation and reconstruction, which were largely reliant on smaller, handcrafted datasets. The dataset was designed with the aim of advancing the field of 3D vision, allowing for the development and generalization improvement of models like Zero123 which work on tasks like novel view synthesis. The creation of Objaverse-XL essentially fills the gap in data availability for 3D vision tasks, particularly in light of increasing demand and interest in simulation, AR and VR technologies, and generative AI."
