# Syntax-Guided Synthesis (2013)
Source: 3754ba-2013.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a standardized interchange format (SYNTH-LIB) for specifying SyGuS inputs, enabling consistent representation for solvers.
- Emphasizes benchmarking infrastructure by assembling a benchmark suite for side-by-side comparisons of solution strategies.

## Evidence extracts
- "SYNTH-LIB Input Format: To specify the input to the SyGuS problem, we have developed an interchange format, called SYNTH-LIB, based on the syntax of SMT-LIB2—the input format accepted by the SMT solvers (see smt-lib.org)." (p. 3)
- "We are in the process of assembling a benchmark suite of synthesis problems to provide a basis for side-by-side comparisons of different solution strategies." (p. 6)
