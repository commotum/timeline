Source: 7a4674-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper's main contribution is an open-source, reproducible benchmarking platform for symbolic regression.
- It builds SRBench as a benchmark project that aggregates diverse datasets and methods into a shared evaluation environment.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, we address this shortcoming by introducing an open-source, reproducible benchmarking platform for symbolic regression." (p. 1)
- "Wecreated SRBench to be a reproducible, open-source benchmarking project by pulling together a large set of diverse benchmark datasets, contemporary SR methods, and ML methods around a shared model evaluation and analysis environment." (p. 4)
