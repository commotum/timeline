Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting
up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge,
and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the
maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate
possible on the given information; ie., it is maximally noncom-
mittal with regard to missing information. If one considers
statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than
as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational
rules, starting with the determination of the partition function,
are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle.
In the resulting “subjective statistical mechanics,” the usual rules
are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and
in particular independently of experimental verification; whether

1, INTRODUCTION

Te recent appearance of a very comprehensive
survey! of past attempts to justify the methods
of statistical mechanics in terms of mechanics, classical
or quantum, has helped greatly, and at a very opportune
time, to emphasize the unsolved problems in this field.

or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the
best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the
information available.

It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded
as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of
additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics
(such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal @ priori probabilities,
etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction
between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists
only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and
their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of
statistical inference.

Although the subject has been under development for
many years, we still do not have a complete and
satisfactory theory, in the sense that there is no line
of argument proceeding from the laws of microscopic
mechanics to macroscopic phenomena, that is generally
regarded by physicists as convincing in all respects.
Such an argument should (a) be free from objection on
mathematical grounds, (b) involve no additional arbi-
