We now give two elementary examples of the treat-
ment of problems using this generalized form of sta-
tistical mechanics.

The pressure ensemble.—Consider a gas with energy
levels E;(V) dependent on the volume. If we are given
macroscopic measurements of the energy (Z) and the
volume (V), the appropriate partition function is

Z00)= f dV >; expL—-ALWAV)—zV J,

where A, » are Lagrangian multipliers. A short calcu-
lation shows that the pressure is given by

P=—(EXV)/AV=n/r,

so that the quantity statistically conjugate to the
volume 1s

w=AP=P/RT.

Thus, when the available information consists of either
of the quantities (7,(£)), plus either of the quantities
(P/T,{V)), the probability distribution which describes
this information, without assuming anything else, is
proportional to

= |

kT

exp (5-11)

This is the distribution of the “pressure ensemble” of
Lewis and Siegert.”

A nuclear polarization effect-—Consider a macroscopic
system which consists of o; (a nucleus with spin J), and
oy (the rest of the system). The nuclear spin is very
loosely coupled to its environment, and they can
exchange angular momentum in such a way that the
total amount is conserved; thus o2 is an angular mo-
mentum bath. On the other hand they cannot exchange
energy, since all states of o, have the same energy.
Suppose we are given the temperature, and in addition
are told that the system ge is rotating about a certain
axis, which we choose as the z axis, with a macroscopi-
cally measured angular velocity w. Does that provide
any evidence for expecting that the nuclear spin J is
polarized along the same axis? Let m2 be the angular
momentum quantum number of os, and denote by #
all other quantum numbers necessary to specify a
state of oz. Then we form the partition function

If the angular velocity w is small, (5-12) may be ap-
proximated by a power series in A:

Z2(B,d) = Z2(B,0)L1—Mmts)ob Sd (me? )o > + - J,

where ( )o stands for an expectation value in the
nonrotating state. In the absence of a magnetic field
(m2)o=0, #2(m)o= RTB, so that (5-13) reduces to

= hea / RT. (5-17)

Thus, the predicted polarization is just what would be
produced by a magnetic field of such strength that the
Larmor frequency wi=w. If |A|<1, the result may be
described by a ‘‘dragging coefficient”

#I(I+1)

There is every reason to believe that this effect actually
exists; it is closely related to’ the Einstem-de Haas
effect. It is especially interesting that it can be predicted
in some detail by a form of statistical mechanics which
does not involve the energy of the spin system, and
makes no reference to the mechanism causing the
polarization. As a numerical example, if a sample of
water is rotated at 36 000 rpm, this should polarize the
protons to the same extent as would a magnetic field
of about 1/7 gauss. This should be accessible to experi-
ment. A straightforward extension of these calculations
would reveal how the effect is modified by nuclear
quadrupole coupling, in the case of higher spin values.

6. CONCLUSION

The essential point in the arguments presented above
is that we accept the von-Neumann—Shannon expres-
sion for entropy, very literally, as a measure of the
amount of uncertainty represented by a probability
distribution; thus entropy becomes the primitive con-
cept with which we work, more fundamental even than
energy. If in addition we reinterpret the prediction
problem of statistical mechanics in the subjective sense,
we can derive the usual relations in a very elementary
way without any consideration of ensembles er appeal
to the usual arguments concerning ergodicity or equal
a priori probabilities. The principles and mathematical
methods of statistical mechanics are geen to be of much
