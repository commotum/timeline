In all the foregoing discussions, the idea has been
implicit that the (f;) on which we base our probability
distributions represent the results of measurements of
various quantities. If the energy is included among the
fx, the resulting equations are identical with those of
conventional statistical mechanics. However, in practice
a measurement of energy is rarely part of the initial
information available; it is the temperature that is
easily measurable. In order to treat the experimental
measurement of temperature from the present point of
view, it is necessary to consider not only the system o1
under investigation, but also another system o:. We
introduce several definitions:

A heat bath is a system o2 such that

(a) The separation of energy levels of o2 is much
smaller than any macroscopically measurable energy
difference, so that the possible energies E.; form, from
the macroscopic point of view, a continuum.

(b) The entropy S. of the maximum-entropy proba-
bility distribution for given (£2) is a definite monotonic
function of (E2); Le., a2 contains no “mechanical
parameters’ which can be varied independently of its
energy.

{c) o» can be placed in interaction with another
system o; in such a way that only energy can be trans-
ferred between them (i.e., no mass, momentum, etc.),
and in the total energy E= E,4 E.-+ Ey», the interaction
term Hy. is small compared to either E, or Ey. This
state of interaction will be called thermal contact.

A thermometer is a heat-bath o2 equipped with a
pointer which reads its average energy. The scale is,
however, calibrated so as to give a number T, called
the temperature, defined by

1/T=dS2/d( EQ). (5-4)

In a measurement of temperature, we place the
thermometer in thermal contact with the system o; of
interest. We are now uncertain not only of the state of
the system o; but also of the state of the thermometer
a2, and so in making inferences, we must find the
maximum-entropy probability distribution of the total
system 2 =a -+o2, subject to the available infermation.
A state of 2 is defined by specifying simultaneously a
state 7 of o; and a state 7 of oz to which we assign a
probability £:;. Now however we have an additional
piece of information, of a type not previously con-
sidered ; we know that the interaction of o1 and o2 may
allow transitions to take place between states (47) and
(mn) if the total energy is conserved:

Fut &o; = Fim t Eon.

In the absence oi detailed knowledge of the matrix
elements of £y, responsible for these transitions (which
in practice is never available), we have no rational basis
for excluding the possibility of any transition of this
type. Therefore all states of 2 having a given total
energy must be considered equivalent; the probability
pi; in its dependence on energy may contain only

628

(Ei,+2.;), not Hy; and £2; separately.'® Therefore, the
maximum-entropy probability distribution, based on
knowledge of (Ze) and the conservation of energy, is
associated with the partition function

Z(M)=% expla (But E25) |= Zi) Za(A), (5-5)

which factors into separate partition functions for the
two systems

ZA) = Qi exp(—AL uy), Z2(4)= 2; exp(—AE2,), (5-6)
with A determined as before by

a)
(E2)= —~— InZ2(r); (5-7)
On

or, solving for \ by use of (2-13), we find that the

quantity statistically conjugate to the energy is the
reciprocal temperature:

h= dSo/d(Eo)=1/T. (5-8)

More generally, this factorization is always possible if
the information available consists of certain properties
of o, by itself and certain properties of a2 by itself.
The probability distribution then factors into two
independent distributions

bis= BA) O;(2), (5-9)
and the total entropy is additive:
S(@)=Sit Se. (3-10)

We conclude that the function of the thermometer is
merely to tell us what value of the parameter should
be used in specifying the probability distribution of
system o). Given this value and the above factorization
property, it is no longer necessary to consider the
properties of the thermometer in detail when incorpo-
rating temperature measurements into our probability
distributions; the mathematical processes used in
setting up probability distributions based on energy or
temperature measurements are exactly the same but
only interpreted differently.

Tt is clear that any quantity which can be inter-
changed between two systems in such a way that the
total amount is conserved, may be used in place of
energy in arguments of the above type, and the funda-
mental symmetry of the theory with respect to such
quantities is preserved. Thus, we may define a ‘volume
bath,” “particle bath,” “momentum bath,” etc., and
the probability distribution which gives the most
unbiased representation of our knowledge of the state
of a system is obtained by the same mathematical
procedure whether the available information consists
of a measurement of (f;) or its statistically conjugate
quantity Az.

18 This argument admittedly lacks rigor, which can be supplied
only by consideration of phase coherence properties between the

various states by means of the density matrix formalism. This,
however, leads to the result given.
