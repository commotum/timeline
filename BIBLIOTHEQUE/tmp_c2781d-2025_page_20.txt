             Preprint, Under Review.
                           11. Information-Gap Planner
              Is there critical information missing?
              If so, formulate a plan focused on gathering the necessary
              information or resolving key uncertainties before proceeding with
              the main task execution.
              If not, state your plan for the next execution steps.
              Output your information-gathering or execution plan strictly in the
              following format:
              <plan>YOUR INFORMATION OR EXECUTION PLAN</plan>
              Replace YOUR INFORMATION OR EXECUTION PLAN with your own plan.
              Keep your plan relatively brief, only focusing on important
              information.
              After your plan, choose exactly ONE action from the allowed actions
              list relevant to this plan.
              Output no other text.
                 Prompt 11: Prompt addressing missing information or uncertainty before acting.
                           12. Logical-Sequence Planner
              Describe the logical sequence of operations you intend to perform
              next.
              Explain the dependency: why does step B follow step A? Focus on the
              immediate sequence.
              Output your logical sequence and rationale strictly in the following
              format:
              <plan>YOUR LOGICAL SEQUENCE PLAN</plan>
              Replace YOUR LOGICAL SEQUENCE PLAN with your own plan.
              Keep your plan relatively brief, only focusing on important
              information.
              After your plan, choose exactly ONE action from the allowed actions
              list representing the first operation in your sequence.
              Output no other text.
                   Prompt 12: Prompt outlining a logically dependent sequence of actions.
