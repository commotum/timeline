Introduction

(1949)
Donald O. Hebb

The Organization of Behavior, New York: Wiley, Introduction and Chapter 4,
“The first stage of perception: growth of the assembly,” pp. xi-xix, 60-78

Donald O. Hebb’s book, The Organization of Behavior, is famous among neural
modelers because it was the first explicit statement of the physiological learning rule
for synaptic modification that has since become known as the Hebb synapse. However,
the book covers a great deal more material than that, and is a thoughtful and thorough
review of neuropsychology, as of 1949,

We have included Hebb’s Introduction in this excerpt. It is a brief and lucid
discussion of the connection between psychology and physiology, and has not dated
one bit between 1949 and now.

The introduction is also notable because in it is one of the first uses of the word
“connectionism” in the context of a complex brain model. The final paragraph of the
Introduction contains these lines: “The theory is evidently a form of connectionism,
one of the switchboard variety, though it does not deal in direct connections between
afferent and efferent pathways: not an ‘S-R’ psychology, if R means a muscular response.
The connections serve rather to establish autonomous central activities, which then
are the basis of further learning” (p. xix). Most modern day connectionists could find
little to argue with in that summation.

A more detailed description of Hebb’s physiological ideas is found in chapter 4. In
this chapter, Hebb has a detailed discussion of neurophysiology and neuroanatomy
as it relates to his ideas. It is worth emphasizing, if it is not obvious at this point, that
the early modelers really knew their neuroscience. James, McCulloch, and Hebb were
highly knowledgable about the nervous system, and used their knowledge extensively
in their models. Much modern work in neural networks has moved far away from its
roots in the study of the brain and psychology. This is a cause for concern, both because
the field is losing contact with its foundations and because it has lost a source of
valuable ideas.

Hebb suggests several important ideas in chapter 4. First, and most famous, was the
clear statement of what has become known as the “Hebb” synapse. To restate Hebb’s
description, for the nth time, “When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B
and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic
change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing
B, is increased” (p. 50). This, like the other ideas in Hebb’s book, is not a mathematical
statement, though it is close to one. For example, Hebb does not discuss the various
possible ways inhibition might enter the picture, or the quantitative learning rule that
is being followed. This has meant that a number of sometimes quite different learning
rules can legitimately be called “Hebb synapses.” (Paper 6, an early computer simula-
tion of Hebb’s ideas, discusses the modifications one must make to this bare outline
to make the system work.)

Chapter 4

Second, Hebb is keenly aware of the “distributed” nature of the representation he
is assuming the nervous system uses. The idea is that to represent something, many
cells must participate in the representation. Hebb was aware of the work of Lashley
(paper 5), suggesting widely distributed representations, and made some use of his
ideas, though not in the strongest form of complete “equipotentiality.”

Third, Hebb postulated the formation of what he called “cell assemblies,” which
were really the heart of the entire book. The basic idea was that there were inter-
connected, self-reinforcing subsets of neurons that formed the representations of infor-
mation in the nervous system. Single cells might belong to more than one assembly,
depending on the context. Multiple ceil assemblies could be active at once, corre-
sponding to complex perceptions or thoughts. There was a distributed representation
at the functional level as well as at the anatomical level. Hebb devotes a good deal of
attention to the details of the neuroanatomy and physiology that might underlie cell
assemblies. The later chapters in the book contain many discussions of how cell
assemblies can be used to help explain a number of psychological phenomena.

In retrospect, the idea that there exist temporarily stable, relatively long lasting
neural activity patterns that are important in mental activity has reappeared in the
various “attractor” models for brain activity (see, for example, Hopfield, paper 27;
Grossberg, paper 24; or Anderson et al., paper 22). Details of the observed and
predicted stability depend critically on learning assumptions that are nearly always
based to some degree on Hebb synapses. Some of the ideas described in this book have
become part of the accepted lore of the field.

Introduction

It might be argued that the task of the psychologist,
the task of understanding behavior and reducing the
vagaries of human thought to a mechanical process of
cause and effect, is a more difficult one than that of any
other scientist. Certainly the problem is enormously
complex; and though it could also be argued that the
progress made by psychology in the century following
the death of James Mill, with his crude theory of asso-
ciation, is an achievement scarcely less than that of the
physical sciences in the same period, it is nevertheless
true that psychological theory is still in its infancy.
There is a long way to go before we can speak of
understanding the principles of behavior to the degree
that we understand the principles of chemical reaction.

In an undertaking of such difficulty, the psychologist
presumably must seek help wherever he can find it.
There have been an increasing number of attempts to
develop new mathematical methods of analysis. With
these, in general, I do not attempt to deal. The method
of factor analysis developed by Spearman (1927) and
greatly elaborated by Thurstone (1935) is well estab-
lished as a powerful tool for handling certain kinds of
data, though the range of its use has been limited by
dependence on tests that can be conveniently given to
large groups of subjects. Another method is the appli-
cation of mathematics more directly to the interaction
of populations of neurons, by Rashevsky, Pitts, House-
holder, Landahl, McCulloch, and others.* Bishop
(1946) has discussed the work from the point of view
of neurophysiology, and his remarks are fully con-
curred with here. The preliminary studies made with
this method so far have been obliged to simplify the
psychological problem almost out of existence. This is
not a criticism, since the attempt is to develop methods
that can later be extended to deal with more complex
data; but as matters stand at present one must wait for
further results before being sure that the attempt will

*Two papers by Culbertson (Bull. Math. Biophys., 1948, 10, 31-40
and 97-102), and Bishop's review article, list some of the more
important of the actual titles in this field.

succeed. Undoubtedly there is great potential value in
such work, and if the right set of initial assumptions
can be found it will presumably become, like factor
analysis, a powerful ally of other methods of study.

However, psychology has an intimate relation with
the other biological sciences, and may also look for
help there. There is a considerable overlap between the
problems of psychology and those of neurophysiology,
hence the possibility (or necessity) of reciprocal assis-
tance. The first object of this book is to present a theory
of behavior for the consideration of psychologists; but
another is to seek a common ground with the anato-
mist, physiologist, and neurologist, to show them how '
psychological theory relates to their problems and at
the same time to make it more possible for them to
contribute to that theory.

Psychology is no more static than any other science.
Physiologists and clinicians who wish to get a theoret-
ical orientation cannot depend only on the writings of
Pavlov or Freud. These were great men, and they have
contributed greatly to psychological thought. But their
contribution was rather in formulating and developing
problems than in providing final answers. Pavlov him-
self seems to have thought of his theory of conditioned
reflexes as something in continual need of revision, and
experimental results have continued to make revisions
necessary: the theory, that is, is still developing. Again,
if one were to regard Freud’s theory as needing change
only in its details, the main value of his work would be
stultified. Theorizing at this stage is like skating on thin
ice—keep moving, or drown. Ego, Id, and Superego
are conceptions that help one to see and state impor-
tant facts of behavior, but they are also dangerously
easy to treat as ghostly realities: as anthropomorphic
agents that want this or disapprove of that, overcoming
one another by force or guile, and punishing or being
punished. Freud has left us the task of developing these
provisional formulations of his to the point where such
a danger no longer exists. When theory becomes static
it is apt to become dogma; and psychological theory
has the further danger, as long as so many of its
problems are unresolved, of inviting a relaps¢ into the
vitalism and indeterminism of traditional thought.

Chapter 4

It is only too easy, no matter what formal theory
of behavior one espouses, to entertain a concealed
mysticism in one’s thinking about that large segment
of behavior which theory does not handle adequately.
To deal with behavior at present, one must oversimplify.
The risk, on the one hand, is of forgetting that one has
oversimplified the problem; one may forget or even
deny those inconvenient facts that one’s theory does
not subsume. On the other hand is the risk of accepting
the weak-kneed discouragement of the vitalist, of being
content to show that existing theories are imperfect
without seeking to improve them. We can take for
granted that any theory of behavior at present must be
inadequate and incomplete. But it is never enough to
say, because we have not yet found out how to reduce
behavior to the control of the brain, that no one in the
future will be able to do so.

Modern psychology takes completely for granted
that behavior and neural function are perfectly cor-
related, that one is completely caused by the other.
There is no separate soul or life-force to stick a finger
into he brain now and then and make neural cells do
what they would not otherwise. Actually, of course, this
is a working assumption only—as long as there are
unexplained aspects of behavior. It is quite conceivable
that some day the assumption will have to be rejected.
But it is important also to see that we have not reached
that day yet: the working assumption is a necessary
one, and there is no real evidence opposed to it. Our
failure to solve a problem so far does not make it
insoluble. One cannot logically be a determinist in
physics and chemistry and biology, and a mystic in
psychology.

All one can know about another’s feelings and aware-
nesses is an inference from what he does—from his
muscular contractions and glandular secretions. These
observable events are determined by electrical and
chemical events in nerve cells. If one is to be consistent,
there is no room here for a mysterious agent that is
defined as not physical and yet has physical effects
(especially since many of the entities of physics are
known only through their effects). “Mind” can only
be regarded, for scientific purposes, as the activity of
the brain, and this should be mystery enough for any-
one: besides the appalling number of cells (some nine
billion, according to Herrick) and even more appalling
number of possible connections between them, the
matter out of which cells are made is being itself re-
duced by the physicist to something quite unlike the
inert stick or stone with which mind is traditionally
contrasted. After all, it is that contrast that is at the
bottom of the vitalist’s objection to a mechanistic biol-
ogy, and the contrast has lost its force (Herrick, 1929).

The mystic might well concentrate on the electron
and let behavior alone. A philosophical parallelism or
idealism, whatever one may think of such conceptions
on other grounds, is quite consistent with the scientific
method, but interactionism seems not to be.

Psychologist and neurophysiologist thus chart the
same bay—working perhaps from opposite shores,
sometimes overlapping and duplicating one another,
but using some of the same fixed points and continually
with the opportunity of contributing to each other's
results. The problem of understanding behavior is the
problem of understanding the total action of the ner-
vous system, and vice versa. This has not always been
a welcome proposition, either to psychologist or to
physiologist.

A vigorous movement has appeared both in psy-
chology and psychiatry to be rid of “physiologizing,”
that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This
point of view has been clearly and effectively put by
Skinner (1938), and it does not by any means represent
a relapse into vitalism. The argument is related to
modern positivism, emphasizes a method of correlat-
ing observable stimuli with observable response, and,
recognizing that “explanation” is ultimately a state-
ment of relationships between observed phenomena,
proposes to go to the heart of the matter and have
psychology confine itself to such statements now. This
point of view has been criticized by Pratt (1939) and
Kéhler (1940). The present book is written in profound
disagreement with such a program for psychology.
Disagreement is on the grounds that this arises from
a misconception of the scientific method as it operates
in the earlier stages. Those apparently naive features
of older scientific thought may have had more to do
with hitting on fertile assumptions and hypotheses than
seems necessary in retrospect. The anti-physiological
position, thus, in urging that psychology proceed now
as it may be able to proceed when it is more highly
developed, seems to be in short a counsel of perfection,
disregarding the limitations of the human intellect.
However, it is logically defensible and may yet show by
its fertility of results that it is indeed the proper approach
to achieving prediction and control of behavior.

If some psychologists jib at the physiologist for a
bedfellow, many physiologists agree with them heart-
ily. One must sympathize with those who want nothing
of the psychologist’s hair-splitting or the indefiniteness
of psychological theory. There is much more certainty
in the study of the electrical activity of a well-defined
tract in the brain. The only question is whether a phy-
siology of the human brain as a whole can be achieved
by such studies alone. One can discover the properties
of its various parts more or less in isolation; but it is


===== Page 006 =====
47

Hebb 1949

a truism by now that the part may have properties
that are not evident in isolation, and these are to be
discovered only by study of the whole intact brain. The
method then calls for learning as much as one can
about what the parts of the brain do (primarily the
physiologist’s field), and relating behavior as far as
possible to this knowledge (primarily for the psycho-
logist); then seeing what further information is to be
had about how the total brain works, from the dis-
crepancy between (1) actual behavior and (2) the be-
havior that would be predicted from adding up what is
known about the action of the various parts.

This does not make the psychologist a physiolo-
gist, for precisely the same reason that the physiologist
need not become a cytologist or biochemist, though
he is intimately concerned with the information that
cytology and biochemistry provide. The difficulties
of finding order in behavior are great enough to re-
quire all one’s attention, and the psychologist is inter-
ested in physiology to the extent that it contributes
to his own task.

The great argument of the positivists who object
to “physiologizing” is that physiology has not helped
psychological theory. But, even if this is true (there is
some basis for denying it), one has to add the words
so far. These has been a great access of knowledge
in neurophysiology since the twenties. The work of
Berger, Dusser de Barenne, and Lorente de No (as
examples) has a profound effect on the physiological
conceptions utilized by psychology, and psychology
has not yet assimilated these results fully.

The central problem with which we must find a way
to deal can be put in two different ways. Psychologically,
it is the problem of thought: some sort of process that
is not fully controlled by environmental stimulation
and yet cooperates closely with that stimulation. From
another point of view, physiologically, the problem is
that of the transmission of excitation from sensory to
motor cortex. This statement may not be as much over-
simplified as it seems, especially when one recognizes
that the “transmission” may be a very complex process
indeed, with a considerable time lag between sensory
stimulation and the final motor response. The failure
of psychology to handle thought adequately (or the
failure of neurophysiology to tell us how to conceive of
cortical transmission) has been the essential weakness
of modern psychological theory and the reason for
persistent difficulties in dealing with a wide range of
experimental and clinical data, as the following chap-
ters will try to show, from the data of perception and
learning to those of hunger, sleep, and neurosis.

In mammals even as low as the rat it has turned out
to be impossible to describe hehavior as an interaction

directly between sensory and motor processes. Some-
thing like thinking, that is, intervenes. “Thought” un-
doubtedly has the connotation of a human degree of
complexity in cerebral function and may mean too
much to be applied to lower animals. But even in the
rat there is evidence that behavior is not completely
controlled by immediate sensory events: there are cen-
tral processes operating also.

What is the nature of such relatively autonomous
activities in the cerebrum? Not even a tentative answer
is available. We know a good deal about the afferent
pathways to the cortex, about the efferent pathways
from it, and about many structures linking the two. But
the links are complex, and we know practically nothing
about what goes on between the arrival of an excitation
at a sensory projection area and its later departure
from the motor area of the cortex. Psychology has had
to find, in hypothesis, a way of bridging this gap in
its physiological foundation. In general the bridge can
be described as some comparatively simple formula of
cortical transmission.* The particular formula chosen
mainly determines the nature of the psychological
theory that results, and the need of choosing is the
major source of theoretical schism.

Two kinds of formula have been used, leading at two
extremes to (1) switchboard theory, and sensori-motor
connections; and (2) field theory. (Either of these terms
may be regarded as opprobrium; they are not so used
here.) (1) In the first type of theory, at one extreme, cells
in the sensory system acquire connections with cells in
the motor system; the function of the cortex is that of
a telephone exchange. Connections rigidly determine
what animal or human being does, and their acquisi-
tion constitutes learning. Current forms of the theory
tend to be vaguer than formerly, because of effective
criticism of the theory in its earlier and simpler forms,
but the fundamental idea is still maintained. (2) Theory
at the opposite extreme denies that learning depends
on connections at all, and attempts to utilize instead
the field conception that physics has found so useful.
The cortex is regarded as made up of so many cells
that it can be treated as a statistically homogeneous
medium. The sensory control of motor centers depends,
accordingly, on the distribution of the sensory excita-
tion and on ratios of excitation, not on locus or the
action of any specific cells.

Despite their differences, however, both theoretical
approaches seem to imply a prompt transmission of
sensory excitation to the motor side, if only by failing
to specify that this is not so. No one, at any rate,
*The simplicity possibly accounts for the opinion expressed by an

anatomist who claimed that psychologists think of the brain as
having all the finer structure of a bowlful of porridge.

has made any serious attempt to elaborate ideas of
a central neural mechanism to account for the delay,
between stimulation and response, that seems so char-
acteristic of thought. There have indeed been neural
theories of “motor” thought, but they amount essen-
tially to a continual interplay of proprioception and
minimal muscular action, and do not provide for
any prolonged sequence of intracerebral events as
such.

But the recalcitrant data of animal behavior have
been drawing attention more and more insistently to
the need of some better account of central processes.
This is what Morgan (1943) has recognized in saying
that “mental” variables, repeatedly thrown out because
there was no place for them in a stimulus-response
psychology, repeatedly find their way back in again in
one form or another. The image has been a forbidden
notion for twenty years, particularly in animal psy-
chology; but the fiend was hardly exorcised before
“expectancy” had appeared instead. What is the neural
basis of expectancy, or of attention, or interest? Older
theory could use these words freely, for it made no
serious attempt to avoid an interactionist philosophy.
In modern psychology such terms are an embarrass-
ment; they cannot be escaped if one is to give a full
account of behavior, but they still have the smell of
animism: and must have, until a theory of thought is
developed to show how “expectancy” or the like can
be a physiologically intelligible process.

In the chapters that follow this introduction I have
tried to lay a foundation for such a theory. It is, on

the one hand and from the physiologist’s point of view,

quite speculative. On the other hand, it achieves some
synthesis of psychological knowledge, and it attempts
to hold as strictly as possible to the psychological
evidence in those long stretches where the guidance of
anatomy and physiology is lacking. The desideratum is
a conceptual tool for dealing with expectancy, atten-
tion, and so on, and with a temporally organized intra-
cerebral process. But this would have little value if it
did not also comprise the main facts of perception, and
of learning. To achieve something of the kind, the
limitations of a schema are accepted with the purpose
of developing certain conceptions of neural action.
This is attempted in Chapters 4 and 5; Chapters | to 3
try to clear the ground for this undertaking. From
Chapter 6 onward the conceptions derived from sche-
matizing are applied to the problems of learning, voli-
tion, emotion, hunger, and so on. (In general, the reader
may regard Chapters 1 to 5 as mainly preparatory,
unless he is particularly interested in the neurological
details, or in the treatment of perception; to get the gist

48

of the theory that is presented here one should read
the two following paragraphs, and turn directly to
Chapter 6.) In outline, the conceptual structure is as
follows:

Any frequently repeated, particular stimulation will
lead to the slow development of a “cell-assembly,” a
diffuse structure comprising cells in the cortex and
diencephalon (and also, perhaps, in the basal ganglia
of the cerebrum), capable of acting briefly as a closed
system, delivering facilitation to other such systems
and usually having a specific motor facilitation. A series
of such events constitutes a “phase sequence” —the
thought process. Each assembly action may be aroused
by a preceding assembly, by a sensory event, or—
normally—by both. The central facilitation from one
of these activities on the next is the prototype of
“attention.” The theory proposes that in this central
facilitation, and its varied relationship to sensory pro-
cesses, lies the answer to an issue that is made inescap-
able by Humphrey’s (1940) penetrating review of the
problem of the direction of thought.

The kind of cortical organization discussed in the
preceding paragraph is what is regarded as essential to
adult waking behavior. It is proposed also that there
is an alternate, “intrinsic” organization, occurring in
sleep and in infancy, which consists of hypersynchrony
in the firing of cortical cells. But besides these two
forms of cortical organization there may be disorgani-
zation. It is assumed that the assembly depends com-
pletely on a very delicate timing which might be
disturbed by metabolic changes as well as by sensory
events that do not accord with the pre-existent central
process. When this is transient, it is called emotional
disturbance; when chronic, neurosis or psychosis.

The theory is evidently a form of connectionism, one
of the switchboard variety, though it does not deal in
direct connections between afferent and efferent path-
ways: not an “S-R” psychology, if R means a muscular
response. The connections serve rather to establish
autonomous central activities, which then are the basis
of further learning. In accordance with modern physio-
logical ideas, the theory also utilizes local field pro-
cesses and gradients, following the lead particularly
of Marshall and Talbot (1942). It does not, further,
make any single nerve cell or pathway essential to any
habit or perception. Modern physiology has presented
psychology with new opportunities for the synthesis
of divergent theories and previously unrelated data,
and it is my intent to take such advantage of these
opportunities as I can.

4. The First Stage of Perception: Growth of
the Assembly

This chapter and the next develop a schema of neural
action to show how a rapprochement can be made be-
tween (1) perceptual generalization, (2) the permanence
of learning, and (3) attention, determining tendency or
the like. It is proposed first that a repeated stimulation
of specific receptors will lead slowly to the formation
of an “assembly” of association-area cells which can
act briefly as a closed system after stimulation has
ceased; this prolongs the time during which the struc-
tural changes of learning can occur and constitutes the
simplest instance of a representative process (image
or idea). The way in which this cell-assembly might
be established, and its characteristics, are the subject
matter of the present chapter. In the following chapter
the interrelationships between cell-assemblies are dealt
with; these are the basis of temporal organization in
central processes (attention, attitude, thought, and so
on). The two chapters (4 and 5) construct the con-
ceptual tools with which, in the following chapters, the
problems of behavior are to be attacked.

The first step in this neural schematizing is a bald
assumption about the structural changes that make
lasting memory possible. The assumption has repeat-
edly been made before, in one way or another, and
repeatedly found unsatisfactory by the critics of learning
theory. I believe it is still necessary. As a result, 1 must
show that in another context, of added anatomical and
physiological knowledge, it becomes more defensible
and more fertile than in the past.

The assumption, in brief, is that a growth process
accompanying synaptic activity makes the synapse
more readily traversed. This hypothesis of synaptic
resistances, however, is different from earlier ones in
the following respects: (1) structural connections are
postulated between single cells, but single cells are not
effective units of transmission and such connections
would be only one factor determining the direction of
transmission; (2) no direct sensori-motor connections
are supposed to be established in this way, in the adult
animal; and (3) an intimate relationship is postulated
between reverberatory action and structural changes
at the synapse, implying a dual trace mechanism.

The Possibility of a Dual Trace Mechanism

Hilgard and Marquis (1940) have shown how a rever-
beratory, transient trace mechanism might be proposed
on the basis of Lorente de N6’s conclusions, that a cell
is fired only by the simultaneous activity of two or

more afferent fibers, and that internuncial fibers are
arranged in closed (potentially self-exciting) circuits.
Their diagram is arranged to show how a reverbera-
tory circuit might establish a sensori-motor connection
between receptor cells and the effectors which carry out
a conditioned response. There is of course a good deal
of psychological evidence which is opposed to such an
oversimplified hypothesis, and Hilgard and Marquis
do not put weight on it. At the same time, it is important
to see that something of the kind is not merely a possible
but a necessary inference from certain neurological
ideas. To the extent that anatomical and physiological
observations establish the possibility of reverberatory
after-effects of a sensory event, it is established that such
a process would be the physiological basis of a tran-
sient “memory” of the stimulus. There may, then, be a
memory trace that is wholly a function of a pattern of
neural activity, independent of any structural change.

Hilgard and Marquis go on to point out that such a
trace would be quite unstable. A reverberatory activity
would be subject to the development of refractory
states in the cells of the circult in which it occurs, and
external events could readily interrupt it. We have
already seen (in Chapter 1) that an “activity” trace can
hardly account for the permanence of early learning,
but at the same time one may regard reverberatory
activity as the explanation of other phenomena.

There are memories which are instantaneously es-
tablished, and as evanescent as they are immediate. In
the repetition of digits, for example, an interval of a few
seconds is enough to prevent any interference from one
series on the next. Also, some memories are both in-
stantaneously established and permanent. To account
for the permanence, some structural change seems
necessary, but a structural growth presumably would
require an appreciable time. If some way can be found
of supposing that a reverberatory trace might cooper-
ate with the structural change, and carry the memory
until the growth change is made, we should be able to
recognize the theoretical value of the trace which is
an activity only, without having to ascribe all memory
to it. The conception of a transient, unstable rever-
beratory trace is therefore useful, if it is possible to
suppose also that some more permanent structural
change reinforces it. There is no reason to think that
a choice must be made between the two conceptions;
there may be traces of both kinds, and memories which
are dependent on both.

A Neurophysiological Postulate

Let us assume then that the persistence or repetition
of a reverberatory activity (or “trace”) tends to induce


===== Page 009 =====

Chapter 4

lasting cellular changes that add to its stability. The
assumption* can be precisely stated as follows: When
an axion of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and
repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some
growth process or metabolic change takes place in one
or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells
firing B, is increased.

The most obvious and I believe much the most
probable suggestion concerning the way in which one
cell could become more capable of firing another is
that synaptic knobs develop and increase the area of
contact between the afferent axon and efferent soma.
(“Soma” refers to dendrites and body, or all of the cell
except its axon.) There is certainly no direct evidence
that this is so, and the postulated change if it exists
may be metabolic, affecting cellular rhythmicity and
limen; or there might be both metabolic and structural
changes, including a limited neurobiotaxis. There are
several considerations, however, that make the growth
of synaptic knobs a plausible conception. The assump-
tion stated above can be put more definitely, as follows:

When one cell repeatedly assists in firing another,
the axon of the first cell develops synaptic knobs (or
enlarges them if they already exist) in contact with the
soma of the second cell. This seems to me the most
likely mechanism of a lasting effect of reverberatory
action, but I wish to make it clear that the subsequent
discussion depends only on the more generally stated
proposition italicized above.

It is wise to be explicit on another point also. The pro-
position does not require action at any great distance,
and certainly is not the same as Kappers’ (Kappers,
Huber, and Crosby, 1936) conception of the way in
which neurobiotaxis controls axonal and dendritic
outgrowth. But my assumption is evidently related to
Kappers’ ideas, and not inconsistent with them. The
theory of neurobiotaxis has been severely criticized,
and clearly it does not do all it was once thought to do.
On the other hand, neurobiotaxis may still be one
factor determining the connections made by neural
cells. If so, it would cooperate very neatly with the
knob formation postulated above. Criticism has been
directed at the idea that neurobiotaxis directs axonal
growth throughout its whole course, and that the pro-
cess sufficiently accounts for all neural connections.
The idea is not tenable, particularly in view of such
work as that of Weiss (19415) and Sperry (1943),

But none of this has shown that neurobiotaxis has
no influence in neural growth; its operation, within
ranges of a centimeter or $0, is still plausible. Thus, in
figure 6 (Lorente de NO, 1938a), the multiple synaptic

knobs of fiber 2 on cell C might be outgrowths from
a fiber passing the cell at a distance, and determined
by the fact of repeated simultaneous excitations in the
two. Again, the course followed by fiber 7 in the neigh-
borhood of cell D may include deflections from the orig-
inal course of the fiber, determined in the same way.
The details of these histological speculations are not
important except to show what some of the possibilities
of change at the synapse might be and to show that the
mechanism of learning discussed in this chapter is not
wholly out of touch with what is known about the
neural cell. The changed facilitation that constitutes
learning might occur in other ways without affecting
the rest of the theory. To make it more specific, I have
chosen to assume that the growth of synaptic knobs,
with or without neurobiotaxis, is the basis of the change
of facilitation from one cell on another, and this is not
altogether implausible. It has been demonstrated by
Arvanitaki (1942) that a contiguity alone will permit

the excitation aroused in one cell to be transmitted to
another. There are also earlier experiments, reviewed
by Arvanitaki, with the same implication. Even more
important, perhaps, is Erlanger’s (1939) demonstration
of impulse transmission across an artificial “synapse,”
a blocked segment of nerve more than a millimeter in
extent. Consequently, in the intact nervous system, an
axon that passes close to the dendrities or body of
a second cell would be capable of helping to fire it, when
the second ceil is also exposed to other stimulation at
the same point. The probability that such closely timed
coincidental excitations would occur is not considered
for the moment but will be returned to. When the
coincidence does occur, and the active fiber, which is
merely close to the soma of another cell, adds to a local
excitation in it, I assume that the joint action tends to
produce a thickening of the fiber—forming a synaptic
knob—or adds to a thickening already present.

Lorente de Né (1938a) has shown that the synaptic
knob is usually not a terminal structure (thus the term
“end foot” or “end button” is misleading), nor always
separated by a stalk from the axon or axon collateral.
If it were, of course, some action at a distance would
be inevitably suggested, if such connections are formed
in learning. The knob instead is often a rather irregular
thickening in the unmyelinated part of an axon near its
ending, where it is threading its way through a thicket
of dendrites and cell bodies. The point in the axon
where the thickening occurs does not appear to be
determined by the structure of the cell of which it is
a part but by something external to the cell and related
to the presence of a second cell. The number and size
of the knobs formed by one cell in contact with a
second cell vary also. In the light of these facts it is not
implausible to suppose that the extent of the contact
established is a function of joint cellular activity, given
propinquity of the two cells.

Also, if a synapse is crossed only by the action of
two or more afferent cells, the implication is that the
greater the area of contact the greater the likelihood
that action in one cell will be decisive in firing another.*

* One point should perhaps be made explicit. Following Lorente de
Né, two afferent cells are considered to be effective at the synapse,
when one is not, only because their contacts with the efferent cell are
close together so their action summates. When both are active, they
create a larger region of local disturbance in the efferent soma. The
larger the knobs in a given cluster, therefore, the smaller the number
that might activate the cell on which they are located. On occasion,
a single afferent cell must be effective in transmission. It is worth
pointing this out, also, because it might appear to the reader other-
wise that there is something mysterious about emphasis on the
necessity of activity in two or more cells to activate the synapse. All
that has really been shown is that in some circumstances two or more
afferent cells are necessary. However, this inevitably implies that an
increase in the number of afferent cells simultaneously active must
increase the reliability with which the synapse is traversed.

Thus three afferent fibers with extensive knob contact
could fire a cell that otherwise might be fired only by
four or more fibers; or fired sooner with knobs than
without.

In short, it is feasible to assume that synaptic knobs
develop with neural activity and represent a lowered
synaptic resistance. It is implied that the knobs appear
in the course of learning, but this does not give us
a means of testing the assumption. There is apparently
no good evidence concerning the relative frequency of
knobs in infant and adult brains, and the assumption
does not imply that there should be none in the new-
born infant. The learning referred to is learning in
a very general sense, which must certainly have begun
long before birth (see e.g., the footnote on pp. 121-2).

Conduction from Area 17

In order to apply this idea (of a structural reinforcement
of synaptic transmission) to visual perception, it is
necessary first to examine the known properties of
conduction from the visual cortex, area 17, to areas 18,
19, and 20. (In view of the criticisms of architectonic
theory by Lashley and Clark [1946], it may be said that
Brodmann’s areas are referred to here as a convenient
designation of relative cortical position, without sup-
posing that the areas are necessarily functional entities
or always histologically distinctive.)

It has already been seen that there is a topological
reproduction of retinal activities in area 17, but that
conduction from 17 to 18 is diffuse. Von Bonin, Garol,
and McCulloch (1942) have found that a localized
excitation in 17 is conducted to a large part of 18,
a band lying along the margins of 17. There is no
point-to-point correspondence of 17 and 18. Excitation
from 18 is conducted back to the nearest border region
of 17; to all parts of area 18 itself; and to all parts of
the contralateral 18, of area 19 (lying anterior to 18),
and of area 20 (in the lower part of the temporal lobe).

The diffusity of conduction from area 17 is illustrated
by the diagram of figure 7. Cells lying in the same part
of 17 may conduct to different points in 18. The cells in
18, thus stimulated, also lead to points in 18 itself which
are widely separated; to any part of the ipsilateral
areas 19 and 20; and, though one synapse, to any part
of the contralateral 19 and 20. Conversely, cells lying
in different parts of 17 or 18 may have connections with
the same point in 18 or 20.

Thus there is convergence as well as spread of exci-
tation. The second point illustrated by figure 7 is a
selective action in 18, depending on the convergence
of fibers from 17. In the figure, F and G are two cells
in area 18 connecting the same macroscopic areas. F,

however, is one that happens to be exposed to exci-
tations from both A and B (two different regions in
area 17). When an area-17 excitation includes both A
and B, F is much more likely to be fired than G. The
figure does not show the short, closed, multiple chains
which are found in all parts of the cortex and whose
facilitating activity would often make it possible for
a single fiber from B to fire G. But the same sort of
local bombardment would also aid in firing F; and the
cell which receives excitations from two area-17 fibers
simultaneously would be more likely to fire than that
which receives excitation from only one.

On the other hand, when B and C (instead of A and
B) are excited simultaneously, G would be more likely
to fire than F. Any specific region of activity in area 17
would tend to excite specific cells in area 18 which
would tend not to be fired by the excitation of another
region in 17. These specific cells in 18 would be diffusely
arranged, as far as we know at random. They would
be usually at some distance from one another and
would always be intermingled with others which are
not fired by the same afferent stimulation, but because
of their lasting structural connections would tend
always to be selectively excited, in the same combina-
tion, whenever the same excitation recurs in area 17.
This of course would apply also in areas 19 and 20.
Since a single point in 18 fires to many points through-
out 19 and 20, excitation of any large number of area-
18 cells means that convergence in 19 and 20 must be
expected. How often it would happen is a statistical
question, which will be deferred to a later section.

The tissues made active beyond area 17, by two dif-
ferent visual stimuli, would thus be (1) grossly the same,

(2) histologically distinct. A difference of stimulating
pattern would not mean any gross difference in the pan.
of the brain which mediates perception (except in the
afferent structures up to and including area 17, the
visual cortex). Even a completely unilateral activity, it
should be noted, would have diffuse effects throughout
areas 18, 19, and 20 not only on one side of the brain
but on both. At the same time, a difference of locus or
pattern of stimulation would mean a difference in the
particular cells in these areas that are consistently or
maximally fired.

Mode of Perceptual Integration: The Cell-Assembly

In the last chapter it was shown that there are impor-
tant properties of perception which cannot be ascribed
to events in area 17, and that these are properties
which seem particularly dependent on learning. That
“identity” is not due to what happens in 17 is strongly
implied by the distortions that occur in the projection
of a retinal excitation to the cortex. When the facts of
hemianopic completion are also considered, the con-
clusion appears inescapable. Perception must depend
on other structures besides area 17.

But we now find, at the level of area 18 and beyond,
that all topographical organization in the visual pro-
cess seems to have disappeared. All that is left is activity
in an irregular arrangement of cells, which are inter-
tangled with others that have nothing to do with the
perception of the moment. We know of course that
perception of simple objects is unified and determinate,
a well-organized process. What basis can be found for
an integration of action, in cells that are anatomically
so disorganized?

An answer to this question is provided by the struc-
tural change at the synapse which has been assumed
to take place in learning. The answer is not simple;
perceptual integration would not be accomplished
directly, but only as a slow development, and, for the
purposes of exposition, at least, would involve several
distinct stages, with the first of which we shall now be
concerned.

The general idea is an old one, that any two cells or
systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the same
time will tend to become “associated,” so that activity
in one facilitates activity in the other. The details of
speculation that follow are intended to show how this
old idea might be put to work again, with the equally
old idea of a lowered synaptic “resistance,” under the
eye of a different neurophysiology from that which
engendered them. (It is perhaps worth while to note
that the two ideas have most often been combined only
in the special case in which one cell is associated with

another, or a higher level or order in transmission,
which it fires; what I am proposing is a possible basis
of association of two afferent fibers of the same order—
in principle, a sensori-sensory association,* in addition
to the linear association of conditioning theory.)

The proposal is most simply illustrated by cells A,
B, and C in figure 8. A and B, visual-area cells, are
simultaneously active. The cell A synapses, of course,
with a large number of cells in 18, and C is supposed
to be one that happens to lead back into 17. Cells such
as C would be those that produce the local wedge-
shaped area of firing in 17 when a point in 18 is strych-
ninized (von Bonin, Garol, and McCulloch, 1942). The
cells in the region of 17 to which C leads are being fired
by the same massive sensory excitation that fires A, and
C would almost necessarily make contact with some
cell B that also fires into 18, or communicate with B at
one step removed, through a short-axon circuit. With
repetition of the same massive excitation in 17 the
same firing relations would recur and, according to the
assumption made, growth changes would take place at
synapses AC and CB. This means that A and B, both
afferent neurons of the same order, would no longer
act independently of each other.

At the same time, in the conditions of stimulation
that are diagrammed in figure 8, A would also be likely
to synapse (directly, or via a short closed link) with
a cell D which leads back into an unexcited part of 17,
and there synapses with still another cell E of the same
order as A and B. The synapse DE, however, would be
unlikely to be traversed, since it is not like CB exposed
to concentrated afferent bombardment. Upon frequent
repetition of the particular excitation in area 17, a
functional relationship of activity in A and B would
increase much more than a relationship of A to E.

* It should be observed, however, that some theorists have continued
to maintain that “S-S” (sensori-sensory) associations are formed in
the learning process, and have provided experimenta] evidence that
seems to establish the fact. See, e.g., Brogden, J. Exp. Psychol., 1947,
37, 527-539, and earlier papers cited therein.

Figure 9A, B, and C are cells in area 18 which are excited by
converging fibers (not shown) leading from a specific pattern of
activity in area t7. D, E, and X are, among the many cells with
which A, B, and C have connections, ones which would contribute
to an integration of their activity. See text.

The same considerations can be applied to the activ-
ity of the enormous number of individual cells in 18, 19,
and 20 that are simultaneously aroused by an extensive
activity in 17. Here, it should be observed, the evidence
of neuronography implies that there are anatomical
connections of every point with every other point,
within a few millimeters, and that there is no orderly
arrangement of the cells concerned.

Figure 9 diagrams three cells, A, B, and C, that are
effectively fired in 18 by a particular visual stimulation,
frequently repeated (by fixation, for example, on some
point in a constant distant environment). D, E, and X
represent possible connections which might be found
between such cells, directly or with intervening links.
Supposing that time relations in the firing of these
cells make it possible, activity in A would contribute
to the firing of E, and that in B to firing C and D.
Growth changes at the synapses AE, BC, BD, and so
on, would be a beginning of integration and would
increase the probability of coordinated activity in each
pair of neurons.

The fundamental meaning of the assumption of
growth at the synapse is in the effect this would have on
the timing of action by the efferent cell. The increased
area of contact means that firing by the efferent cell is
more likely to follow the lead of the afferent cell. A fiber
of order n thus gains increased control over a fiber
n+ 1, making the firing of n+ 1 more predictable
or determinate. The control cannot be absolute, but
“optional” (Lorente de N6, 1939), and depends also
on other events in the system. In the present case,
however, the massive excitation in 17 would tend to
establish constant conditions throughout the system
during the brief period of a single visual fixation; and
the postulated synaptic changes would also increase
the degree of this constancy. A would acquire an in-
creasing control of E, and E, with each repetition of the
visual stimulus, would fire more consistently at the


===== Page 013 =====

Chapter 4

same time that B is firing (B, it will be recalled, is
directly controlled by the area-17 action). Synaptic
changes EB would therefore result. Similarly, B ac-
quires an increasing control of D; and whenever a cell
such as D happens to be one that connects again with
B, through X, a closed cycle (BDX B) is set up.

It is, however, misleading to put emphasis on the coin-
cidences necessary for the occurrence of such a simple
closed circuit. Instead of a ring or hoop, the best anal-
ogy to the sort of structure which would be set up
or “assembled” is a closed solid cage-work, or three-
dimensional lattice, with no regular structure, and with
connections possible from any one intersection to any
other. Let me say explicitly, again, that the specificity
of such an assembly of cells in 18 or 20, to a particular
excitation in 17, depends on covergences. Whenever two
cells, directly or indirectly controlled by that excita-
tion, converge on another cell (as E and X converge
on B in figure 9) the essential condition of the present
schematizing is fulfilled; the two converging cells need
not have any simple anatomical or physiological re-
lation to one another, and physiological integration
would not be supposed to consist of independent closed
chains.

This has an important consequence. Lorente de NO
(19385) has put stress on the fact that activity in a short
closed circuit must be rapidly extinguished, and could
hardly persist as long as a hundredth of a second. It is
hard, on the other hand, to see how a long, many-
linked chain, capable of longer reverberation, would
get established as a functional unit. But look now at
figure 10, which diagrams a different sort of possibility.
Arrows represent not neurons, but multiple pathways,
of whatever complexity is necessary so that each arrow
stands for a functional unit. These units fire in the order
1, 2, 3, --+ 15. The pathway labeled (1,4) is the first

to fire, and also the fourth; (2,14) fires second and
fourteenth; and so on. The activity 1-2-3-4 is in a
relatively simple closed circuit. At this point the next
unit (2, 14) may be refractory, which would effectively
extinguish reverberation in that simple circuit. But at
this point, also, another pathway (5, 9) may be excitable
and permit activity in the larger system to continue
in some way as that suggested by the numbers in the
figure. The sort of irregular three-dimensional net which
might be the anatomical basis of perceptual integration
in the association areas would be infinitely more com-
plex than anything one could show with a diagram and
would provide a large number of the multiple parallel
(or alternate) units which are suggested by figure 10. If
so, an indefinite reverberation in the structure might be
possible, so long as the background activity in other
cells in the same gross region remained the same. It
would not of course remain the same for long, especially
with changes of visual fixaton; but such considerations
make it possible to conceive of “alternating” rever-
beration which might frequently last for periods of time
as great as half a second or a second.

(What I have in mind, in emphasizing half a second
or so as the duration of a reverberatory activity, is the
observed duration of a single content in perception
(Pillsbury, 1913; Boring, 1933]. Attention wanders,
and the best estimate one can make of the duration of
a single “conscious content” is of this time-order.)

This then is the cell-assembly. Some of its character-
istics have been defined only by implication, and these
are to be developed elsewhere, particularly in the re-
mainder of this chapter, in the following chapter, and in
Chapter 8 (see pp. 195-7). The assembly is thought of
as a system inherently involving some equipotentiality,
in the presence of alternate pathways each having the
same function, so that brain damage might remove
some pathways without preventing the system from
functioning, particularly if the system has been long
established, with well-developed synaptic knobs which
decrease the number of fibers that must be active at
once to traverse a synapse.

Statistical Considerations

It must have appeared to the reader who examined
figures 8 and 9 carefully that there was something
unlikely about its being arranged at the Creation to
have such neat connections exactly where they were
most needed for my hypothesis of perceptual integra-
tion. The answer of course is statistical: the neurons
diagrammed were those which happen to have such
connections, and, given a large enough population of
connecting fibers distributed at random, the improbable


===== Page 014 =====
55

Hebb 1949

connection must become quite frequent, in absolute
numbers. The next task is to assess the statistical ele-
ment in these calculations, and show that probability
is not stretched too far.

The diagrams and discussion of the preceding sec-
tion require the frequent existence of two kinds of
coincidence: (1) synchronization of firing in two or
more converging axons, and (2) the anatomical fact of
convergence in fibers which are, so far as we know,
arranged at random. The necessity of these coincidences
sets a limit to postulating functional connections ad
lib. as the basis of integration. But this is not really
a difficulty, since the psychological evidence (as we
shall see) also implies that there are limits to perceptual
integration.

Consider first the enormous frequency and complex-
ity of the actual neural connections that have been
demonstrated histologically and physiologically. One
is apt to think of the neural cell as having perhaps two
or three or half a dozen connections with other cells,
and as leading from one minute point in the central
nervous system to one other minute point. This impres-
sion is far from the truth and no doubt is due to the
difficulty of representing the true state of affairs in
a printed drawing.

Forbes (1939) mentions for example an estimate of
1300 synaptic knobs on a single anterior horn cell.
Lorente de No’s drawings (1943, figures 71-73, 75)
show a complexity, in the ramification of axon and
dendrite, that simply has no relation whatever to dia-
grams (such as mine) showing a cell with one or two
connections. The gross extent of the volume of cortex
infiltrated by the collaterals of the axon of a single
neuron is measured in millimeters, not in microns; it
certainly is not a single point, microscopic in size. In
area 18, the strychnine method demonstrates that each
tiny area of cortex has connections with the whole
region. (These areas are about as smail as 1 sq. mm.,
according to McCulloch, 19446.) It puts no great strain
on probabilities to suppose that there would be, in area
18, some anatomical connection of any one cell, excited
by a particular visual stimulation, with a number of
others excited in the same way.

There is, therefore, the anatomical basis of a great
number of convergences among the multitude of cor-
tical cells directly or indirectly excited by any massive
retinal activity. This is to be kept in mind as one ap-
proaches the physiological question of synchronization
in the converging fibers. In the tridimensional, lattice-
like assembly of cells that I have supposed to be the
basis of perceptual integration, those interconnecting
neurons which synapse with the same cell would be
functionally in parallel. Figure 10 illustrates this. The

pathways labeled (1, 4), (8), and (13), converging on one
synapse, must have the same function in the system; or
the two-link pathway (5, 9)-(6, 10) the same function as
the single link (2, 14). When impulses in one such path
are not effective, those in another, arriving at a different
time, could be.

Once more, the oversimplification of such diagrams
is highly misleading. At each synapse there must be
a considerable dispersion in the time of arrival of im-
pulses, and in each individual fiber a constant variation
of responsiveness; and one could never predicate a
determinate pattern of action in any small segment of
the system. In the larger system, however, a statistical
constancy might be quite predictable.

It is not necessary, and not possible, to define the
cell-assembly underlying a perception as being made
up of neurons all of which are active when the proper
visual stimulation occurs. One can suppose that there
would always be activity in some of the group of ele-
ments which are in functional parallel (they are not
of course geometrically parallel). When for example
excitation can be conducted to a particular point in
the system from five different directions, the activity
characteristic of the system as a whole might be main-
tained by excitation in any three of the five pathways,
and no one fiber would have to be synchronized with
any other one fiber.

There would still be some necessity of synchroniza-
tion, and this has another aspect. In the integration
which has been hypothesized, depending on the devel-
opment of synaptic knobs and an increasing probability
of control by afferent over efferent fibers, there would
necessarily be a gradual change of the frequency char-
acteristics of the system. The consequence would be a
sort of fractionation and recruitment, and some change
in the neurons making up the system. That is, some
units, capable at first of synchronizing with others in
the system, would no longer be able to do so and would
drop out: “fractionation.” Others, at first incompatible,
would be recruited. With perceptual development there
would thus be a slow growth in the assembly, under-
standing by “growth” not necessarily an increase in the
number of constituent cells, but a change. How great
the change would be there is no way of telling, but it is
a change that may have importance for psychological
problems when some of the phenomena of association
are considered.

This then is the statistical approach to the problem.
It is directly implied that an “association” of two cells
in the same region, or of two systems of cells, would
vary, in the probability of its occurrence, over a wide
range. If one chose such pairs at random one would
find some between which no association was possible,


===== Page 015 =====
56

Chapter 4

some in which association was promptly and easily
established when the two were simultaneously active,
and a large proportion making up a gradiation from
one of these extremes to the other. The larger the
system with a determinate general pattern of action,
the more readily an association could be formed with
another system: On a statistical basis, the more points
at which a chance anatomical convergence could occur,
the greater the frequency of effective interfacilitation
between the two assemblies.

Psychologically, these ideas mean (1) that there is
a prolonged period of integration of the individual
perception, apart from associating the perception with
anything else; (2) that an association between two per-
ceptions is likely to be possible only after each one has
independently been organized, or integrated; (3) that,
even between two integrated perceptions, there may be
a considerable variation in the ease with which associa-
tion can occur. Finally, (4) the apparent necessity of
supposing that there would be a “growth,” or fractiona-
tion and recruitment, in the cell-assembly underlying
perception means that there might be significant differ-
ences in the properties of perception at different stages
ofintegration. One cannot guess how great the changes
of growth would be; but it is conceivable, even prob-
able, that if one knew where to look for the evidence
one would find marked differences of identity in the
perceptions of child and adult.

The psychological implications of my schematizing,
as far as it has gone, have been made explicit in order
to show briefly that they are not contrary to fact. We
are not used to thinking of a simple perception as
slowly and painfully learned, as the present chapter
would suggest; but it has already been seen, in the
discussion of the vision of the congenitally blind after
operation, that it actually is. The slowness of learning,
and the frequent instances of total failure to learn at
all in periods as great as a year following operation
(Senden, 1932), are extraordinary and incredible (if it
were not for the full confirmation by Riesen, 1947). The
principles of learning to be found in psychological
textbooks are derived from the behavior of the half-
grown or adult animal. Our ideas as to the readiness
with which association is set up apply to the behavior
of the developed organism, as Boring (1946) has noted;
there is no evidence whatever to show that a similarly
prompt association of separate perceptions can occur
at birth—that it is independent of a slow process in
which the perceptions to be associated must first be
integrated.

As to the wide range in difficulty of associating two
ideas or perceptions, even for the adult, this is psycho-
logically a matter of common experience. Who has not

had trouble remembering, in spite of repeated efforts,
the spelling or pronunciation of some word, or the
name of some acquaintance? The fact of the unequal
difficulty of associations is not stressed in the literature,
probably because it does not fit into conditioned-reflex
theory; but it is a fact. My speculations concerning the
nature of the trace and the aboriginal development of
perception thus are not obviously opposed to the psy-
chological evidence. Further evaluation can be post-
poned until the speculations have been fully developed.
