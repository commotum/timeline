# Mastering diverse control tasks through world models (2025)
Source: c4feab-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces DreamerV3 as a general reinforcement-learning algorithm intended to master many domains with fixed hyperparameters.
- The contribution centers on a world-model-based learning algorithm and robustness techniques, not positional encoding, dimensional lifting, or a new benchmark.

## Evidence extracts
- "The world model learns compact representations of sensory inputs through autoencoding24 and enables planning by predicting future representations and rewards for potential actions." (p. 2)
- "We present the third generation of the Dreamer algorithm, a general reinforcement-learning algorithm that masters a wide range of domains with fixed hyperparameters." (p. 6)
