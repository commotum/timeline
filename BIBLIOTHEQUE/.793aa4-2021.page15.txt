                    Earlier we present an ablation study on XTREME in Table 5 for decoupled positional attention variants.
                    Wecompare DIET-REL and DIET-ABS against the baseline (Devlin et al., 2018). We now present a
                    similar study on the GLUE benchmark in Table 8 and observe similar results.
                    Positional Encoding         In Table 8, moving positional embeddings from input to per-head improves
                    average score for both DIET-REL (+0.1%) and DIET-ABS (+0.2%).
                    Segment Encoding In Table 8, moving segment embeddings from input to per-head improves both
                    DIET-REL (+0.3%) and DIET-ABS (+0.05%).
                    Sharing Strategies        Sharing plays an important role for DIET-ABS. In Table 9, we ﬁnd that sharing will
                    degrade the performance of DIET-REL (-0.2% layer-wise, -0.3% head-wise). For DIET-ABS, sharing
                    makesthemodelmorestable, and able to compete with DIET-REL.

                    hurts the performance of DIET-REL with both layer-wise or head-wise sharing.
