# Mastering Atari, Go, chess and shogi by planning with a learned model (2020)
Source: 757142-2020.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper frames planning as a missing capability and proposes MuZero to address it, indicating a new reasoning/planning mechanism.
- The core contribution is a mechanism that combines tree-based search with a learned model that predicts policy, value, and reward for planning, rather than a dataset or positional encoding change.

## Evidence extracts
- "Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the main challenges in the pursuit of artificial intelligence." (Abstract)
- "Here we present the MuZero algorithm, which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics." (Abstract)
