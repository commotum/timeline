# Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities (1982)
Source: 142e75-1982.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a neural network model whose collective dynamics yields a content-addressable memory and uses an explicit asynchronous processing algorithm.
- Frames computation as emergent collective behavior in the network, emphasizing stable-memory recall as an intrinsic property of the model.

## Evidence extracts
- "The algorithm for the
time evolution ofthe state ofthe system is based on asynchronous
parallel processing." (p. 1)
- "and the network has little structure. Nonetheless, collective
computational properties spontaneously arose." (p. 5)
