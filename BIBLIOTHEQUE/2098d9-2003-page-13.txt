                         Table 1: Comparative results on the Brown corpus. The deleted interpolation trigram has a test per-
                                    plexity that is 33% above that of the neural network with the lowest validation perplexity.
                                    The difference is 24% in the case of the best n-gram (a class-based model with 500 word
                                    classes). n : order of the model. c : number of word classes in class-based n-grams. h :
                                    number of hidden units. m : number of word features for MLPs, number of classes for
                                    class-based n-grams. direct: whether there are direct connections from word features to
                                    outputs. mix: whether the output probabilities of the neural network are mixed with the
                                    output of the trigram (with a weight of 0.5 on each). The last three columns give perplexity
                                    on the training, validation and test sets.
                         probabilities. On the other hand, without those connections the hidden units form a tight bottleneck
                         which might force better generalization.
                             Table 2 gives similar results on the larger corpus (AP News), albeit with a smaller difference
                         in perplexity (8%). Only 5 epochs were performed (in approximately three weeks with 40 CPUs).
                         The class-based model did not appear to help the n-gram models in this case, but the high-order
                         modiﬁed Kneser-Ney back-off model gave the best results among the n-gram models.

                         In this section, we describe extensions to the model described above, and directions for future work.
