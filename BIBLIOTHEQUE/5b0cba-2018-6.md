# Search-based Program Synthesis (2018)
Source: 5b0cba-2018.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper frames syntax-guided program synthesis as a formal search problem over program expressions constrained by syntax and logic.
- It emphasizes community infrastructure like standardization, benchmark collection, and solver competition as key to progress in synthesis.

## Evidence extracts
- "Syntex-guided synthesis formalizes the computational problem of searching for a program expression that meets both syntactic and logical constraints." (p. 1)
- "Standardization, benchmark collection, and solver competition have led to significant advances in solution strategies and new applications." (p. 1)
