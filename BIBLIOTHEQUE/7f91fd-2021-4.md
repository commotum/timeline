# A large-scale benchmark for few-shot program induction and synthesis (2021)
Source: 7f91fd-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Presents PROGRES as a large-scale benchmark/dataset for few-shot program induction based on real programs and unit tests.
- The main contribution is scaling and providing a benchmark with many program-induction tasks for evaluating methods.

## Evidence extracts
- "This allows us to create PROGRES, a large-scale
few-shot program-induction benchmark of real
programs and propose new challenges in this do-
main." (p. 1)
- "We provide a new dataset of more than 200, 000 pro-
gram induction tasks, with multiple challenges for the
program synthesis and few-shot learning communities." (p. 3)
