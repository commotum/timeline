                             Substituting the above value for σ back to the inequality and using theorem’s assumption gives us
                             following inequality:          √                              √

                             We report in table 5 results obtained on SVHN and Fashion-MNIST datasets. On these datasets,
                             SAMallows a simple WideResNet to reach or push state-of-the-art accuracy (0.99% error rate for
                             SVHN,3.59%forFashion-MNIST).

                             For auto-augment, we use the best policy found on this dataset as described in (Cubuk et al., 2018)
                             plus cutout (Devries & Taylor, 2017). For Fashion-MNIST, the auto-augmentation line correspond
                             to cutout only.

                             via a joint grid search prior to applying SAM; all other model hyperparameter values are identical
                             to those used in prior work.
                             For the Imagenet results (ResNet models), the models are trained for 100, 200 or 400 epochs on
                             Google Cloud TPUv3 32 cores with a batch size of 4096. The initial learning rate is set to 1.0 and

                             Finally, for the noisy label experiments, we also found ρ by gridsearch, computing the accuracy
                             on a (non-noisy) validation set composed of a random subset of 10% of the usual CIFAR training
                             samples. We report the validation accuracy of the bootstrapped version of SAM for different levels
                             of noise and different ρ in table 8.
