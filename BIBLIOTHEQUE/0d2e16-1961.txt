                    Here we pause only to observe a trivial point: By (14), the solu-
                    tions of the estimation problem are necessarily linear; hence the 
                    same must be true (if the duality theorem is correct) of the solu-

                      The first proof of the duality theorem appeared in [11], and 
                    consisted of comparing the end results of the solutions of the two 
                    problems. Assuming only that the solutions of both problems 
                    result in linear dynamical systems, the proof becomes much 
                    simpler and less mysterious; this argument was carried out in 
                    detail in [16].

                             variance. The inner product is defined as (X, Y) = 8[x*,                                                                         If R(T) is positive definite in this interval, then condition (45) is 
                             x(fi)] • [x*, y(2i)]. The subspace 11 is the set of all scalar random                                                        necessary. In fact, let B(2, r) denote the bracketed term in (44). 
                             variables of the type                                                                                                        If A(2, r) satisfies the Wiener-Hopf equation (38), then x(2|2) 
                                                                                                                                                          given by (14) is an optimal estimate; and the same holds also for 
                                                 U = [x* u«0] = [x*, f' B«,, r)z(r)dr]                                                                                                         x(<|2) + B(2, r)2(r)dr 
                             (where B(2i, r) is an n X p matrix continuously differentiable in 
                             both arguments). We write Uo for the estimate [x*, x(2i|2)] •                                                                since by (45) A(2, r) + B(2, r) also satisfies the Wiener-Hopf equa-
                                 We now apply the orthogonal projection lemma and find that                                                               tion. But by the lemma, the norm of the difference of two opti-

                                                    (X - Uo, U) = S [x* x(i,|0][x*. u(fa)]                                                                x* j J]' J' B (2, r)cov[2(r), 2(r')]B'(2, r')drdr'| x*' = 0 (46)

                                                                                                 1                                                        for all x*. By the assumptions of Section 4, y(r) and v(r) are

                             (permissible in view of the continuity assumptions made under                                                                           cov[2(r), 2(r')l = R(r)5(r - r') + cov[y(r), y(r')] 
                             (Ai), see [28]), we get

                                                                                                                                                          the first term is positive unless (45)                           holds (because of the positive 
                             This expression must vanish for all x*. Sufficiency of (39) is                                                               definiteness of R(r)), which concludes the proof. 
                             obvious. To prove the necessity, we take B(<i, a) = cov[x(<i|0>                                                                  Differentiating (14), with respect to 2 we find 
                             2(a)]. Then BB' is nonnegative definite. By continuity, the                                                                                                           rt a 
                             integral will be positive for some x* unless BB' and therefore also                                                                         dx(t\t)/dt = — A(2, r)2(r)dr + A(2, l)i'l) 
                             B(ti, a) vanishes identically for all to g a < t. The Corollary                                                                                                     Jt0 
                             follows trivially by multiplying (39) on the right by A'(2i, a) and                                                              Using the abbreviation A(2,2) = K(0 as well as (45) and (14),

                          Combining (10) and (I), we obtain the differential equation for                                             The only point remaining in the proof of Theorem 1 is to de-
                          the error of the optimal estimate:                                                                       termine the initial conditions for (IV). From (38) it is clear that 
                          dx{t\t)/dt = [F(0 - K(0H(i)]x(t|t) + G(0u(0 - K(j)v(0 (H)                                                                                         x(tw|lo) = 0 
                             To obtain an explicit expression for K(t), we observe first that                                      Hence 
                          (39) implies that following identity in the interval to a < t:                                                                   Po = P(/«) = cov[x(fc|«o), x«o|fo)] 
                          cov [x(0, y(<r)] - A(I, r) cov [y(r), y(<r)]dr = A(i, <r)R(<r)                                                                        = cov[x(to), x(fc)) 
                                                                                                                      (39')        In case of the conventional Wiener theory (see (A )), the                             last term 
                                                                                                                                                                                                  3
                          Since both sides of (39') are continuous functions of ff, it is clear                                    is evaluated by means of (36). 
                          that equality holds also for cr — t. Therefore                                                              This completes the proof of Theorem 1.

                                                                                        = cov [x((|i)  x(<)]H'(<)                     Using the duality relations (16), all proofs can be reduced to 
                                                                                                        f                          those given for the regulator problem in [17]. 
                          By (40), we have then                                                                                       (1) The fact that solutions of the variance equation exist for 
                                              = cov [x(t|<), *(i|«)]H'(0 = P(0H'(<)                                               all t ^ <o is proved in [17, Theorem (6.4)], using the fact that the 
                                                                                                                                  variance of x(<) must be finite in any finite interval [to, (]. 
                             Since R(0 is assumed to be positive definite, it is invertible and                                       (2) Theorem 3 is proved by showing that there exists a particu-
                         therefore                                                                                                lar estimate of finite but not necessarily minimum variance. 
                                                                                                                                  Under (A '), this is proved in [17; Theorem (6.6)]. A trivial

                             We can now derive the variance equation. Let W(I, r) be the                                          (Ai). 
                         common transition matrix of (I) and (II). Then                                                               (3) Theorem 4 is proved in [17; Theorems (6.8), (6.10), (7.2)]. 
                         P(0 - W(t, to)P(tc)W(t, t )                                                                              The stability of the optimal filter is proved by noting that the 
                                                        0                                                                         estimation error plays the role of a Lyapunov function. The
