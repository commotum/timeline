                5    Coarse-Graining Experiment
                5.1    Method
                To derive a coarse-grained version of the automaton state from its original, ﬁne-grained version, we
                construct a new array in which the value of each cell is the average of the values of the nearby cells
                in the ﬁne-grained array. We deﬁne “nearby” cells as those within a g × g square centered at the
                cell in question. The value of g is called the grain size, and here is selected experimentally.  This
                procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.
                    Given this array of averages, we then threshold its ﬂoating-point values into three buckets.
                Visually, these buckets represent areas which are mostly coﬀee (values close to 0), mostly cream
                (values close to 1), or mixed (values close to 0.5). The estimated complexity of the state, K (S), is
                the ﬁle size of the thresholded, coarse-grained array after compression. Analogously, the estimated
                entropy of the automaton state is the compressed ﬁle size of the ﬁne-grained array.
                5.2    Results and Analysis
                Results from simulation of the automaton using the coarse-graining metric are shown in Figure 2.

                for the interacting model are shown at left, and results for the non-interacting model are at right.
