# An Integrative Theory of Prefrontal Cortex Function (2001)
Source: 1e334c-2001.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper explains how coordinated behavior and cognitive control arise from brain activity and neural circuitry, which is a neuroscience framing rather than an ML method.
- It centers the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a source of top-down biasing, presenting an integrative theory of PFC function as cross-disciplinary context.

## Evidence extracts
- "behavior arises from the distributed activity of billions of neurons in the brain." (p. 1)
- "Desimone & Duncan suggest that the PFC is an important source of such top-down biasing." (p. 5)
