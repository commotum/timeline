# Spherical Mask: Coarse-to-Fine 3D Point Cloud Instance Segmentation with Spherical Representation (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: b341ec-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper introduces Spherical Mask as a novel coarse-to-fine approach based on spherical representation, which is a modeling method contribution.
- The focus is on 3D point cloud instance segmentation as the target ML task, rather than a new dataset/benchmark or positional encoding change.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this work, we introduce Spherical Mask, a novel coarse-to-fine approach based on spherical repre- sentation, overcoming those two limitations with several benefits." (p. 1)
- "3D instance segmentation has gained immense attention with its wide range of applications for Indoor Scanning[38], AugmentedReality(AR)[18], and Autonomous Driving[22]." (p. 1)
