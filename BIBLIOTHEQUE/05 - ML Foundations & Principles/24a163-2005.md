# Tree-Based Batch Mode Reinforcement Learning (2005)
Source: 24a163-2005.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a batch mode reinforcement learning approach that uses Q-function approximation from four-tuples rather than proposing new datasets or transformer architectures.
- Focuses on tree-based regression/ensemble methods as the learning mechanism within this reinforcement learning framework.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper we consider batch mode learning, where the learning agent is in principle not directly interacting with the system but receives only a set of four-tuples" (p. 1)
- "In this paper, we study within this framework the empirical properties and performances of several tree-based regression algorithms on several applications." (p. 2)
