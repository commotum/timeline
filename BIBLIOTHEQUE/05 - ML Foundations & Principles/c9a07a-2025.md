# Rethinking Visual Intelligence: Insights from Video Pretraining (2025)
Source: c9a07a-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a general framework to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to visual tasks, which is a methodological/training contribution rather than a positional encoding or dimensional lifting change.
- Centers on a controlled comparison to isolate the effect of video pretraining and inductive biases, aligning with foundational empirical analysis.

## Evidence extracts
- "we introduce a simple and general framework for adapting VDMs to a broad class of visual tasks" (Introduction)
- "This symmetry provides a controlled basis for comparison and isolates the impact of video pretraining on structured visual understanding." (Introduction)
