# Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences (1988)
Source: 152333-1988.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces temporal-difference (TD) methods as incremental learning procedures specialized for prediction problems.
- Provides theoretical grounding by proving convergence and optimality and relating TD methods to supervised-learning procedures.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this article, we introduce and provide tilt first formal results in the theory of temporal-difference {TD) methods, a class of incremental learning procedures specialized for prediction problems." (p. 2)
- "Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods." (p. 1)
