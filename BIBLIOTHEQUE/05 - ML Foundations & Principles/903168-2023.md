# DiffusionDet: Diffusion Model for Object Detection (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: 903168-2023.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a new object detection framework based on a denoising diffusion process, which is a modeling method rather than a positional encoding or dimensional-lifting contribution.
- Focuses on detection performance and inference procedure, not on datasets/benchmarks or measurement infrastructure.

## Evidence extracts
- "We propose DiffusionDet, a new framework that formulates object detection as a denoising diffusion process from noisy boxes to object boxes." (p. 1)
- "In inference, the model refines a set of randomly generated boxes to the output results in a progressive way." (p. 1)
