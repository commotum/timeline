# Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems (1983)
Source: 14feaa-1983.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes new neuronlike adaptive elements (ASE and ACE) that define the learning architecture and rules for reinforcement-based control.
- Centers on improving reinforcement learning signals and credit assignment for control tasks rather than datasets, positional encoding, or dimensional lifting.

## Evidence extracts
- "We call one element an associative search element (ASE) and the other an adaptive critic element (ACE)." (p. 3)
- "ACE receives same nonreinforcing input as ASE and uses it to compute an improved or internal reinforcement signal to be used by ASE." (p. 10)
