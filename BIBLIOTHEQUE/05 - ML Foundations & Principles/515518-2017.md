# Neural Program Meta-Induction (2017)
Source: 515518-2017.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes cross-task knowledge transfer methods to improve program induction in limited-data scenarios.
- Describes the META model as a k-shot learning system for program induction.

## Evidence extracts
- "Speciﬁcally, we propose two approaches for cross-task knowledge
transfer to improve program induction in limited-data scenarios." (Abstract)
- "The META model could also be
described as a k-shot learning system, closely related to Duan et al. [6] and Santoro et al. [19]." (Section 5 MetaProgramInduction)
