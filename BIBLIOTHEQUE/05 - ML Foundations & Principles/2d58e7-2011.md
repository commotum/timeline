# Synthesis From Examples: Interaction Models and Algorithms (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: 2d58e7-2011.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper centers on inductive synthesis from examples and explicitly describes interaction models and algorithmic methodologies for such synthesis.
- It characterizes synthesis from examples as a search problem over DSL artifacts and emphasizes algorithmic techniques to address it.

## Evidence extracts
- "This paper describes some effective user interaction models and algorithmic methodologies for synthesis from examples" (p. 1)
- "The key technical challenge in synthesis from examples is to map the examples to artifact(s) in the underlying DSL. This is essentially a search problem, and can benefit from techniques developed in various communities." (p. 2)
