# AI Feynman: a Physics-Inspired Method for Symbolic Regression (2020)
Source: 5ffd65-2019.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a recursive symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with physics-inspired techniques, which is a methodological ML contribution.
- Describes a novel algorithmic approach that reduces problems via discovered symmetries and separability, emphasizing method design rather than positional encoding or domain lifting.

## Evidence extracts
- "we develop a recursive multidimensional symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with a suite of physics-inspired techniques." (p. 1)
- "We have presented a novel physics-inspired algorithm for solving multidimensional analytic regression problems: finding a symbolic expression that matches data from an unknown algebraic function. Our key innovation lies in combining traditional fitting techniques with a neural-network-based approach that can repeatedly reduce a problem to simpler ones, eliminating dependent variables by discovering properties such as symmetries and separability in the unknown function."
