# BlinkFill: Semi-supervised Programming By Example for Syntactic String Transformations (2016)
Source: 446908-2016.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper introduces BlinkFill as a PBE system that learns string transformations from input-output examples using logical information in spreadsheet data.
- It develops the InputDataGraph data structure to represent logical patterns and learn substring expressions for program synthesis.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, we present BlinkFill, a PBE system that
  eﬃciently learns string transformations in spreadsheets from
  input-output examples by leveraging the logical information" (p. 1)
- "We develop a data structure InputDataGraph to succinctly
  represent a large set of logical patterns that are shared across
  the input data, and use this graph to eﬃciently learn sub-
  string expressions in a new PBE system BlinkFill. We" (p. 1)
