# A Tutorial Introduction to the Minimum Description Length Principle (2004)
Source: 225f2d-2004.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is an overview/tutorial of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) Principle, a foundational principle for learning and model selection rather than a new model architecture or dataset.
- It explains MDL as a model selection criterion based on stochastic complexity/codelength, which is a core ML/statistical principle.

## Evidence extracts
- "This tutorial provides an overview of and introduction to Rissanen’s Minimum De-
scription Length (MDL) Principle." (p. 1)
- "Summary We introduced the reﬁned MDL Principle for model selection in a re-
stricted setting. Reﬁned MDL amounts to selecting the model under which the data
achieve the smallest stochastic complexity, which is the codelength according to the
minimax optimal universal model." (p. 13)
