# Simultaneous instance pooling and bag representation selection approach for multiple-instance learning (MIL) using vision transformer (2024)
Source: b2ce18-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a MIL method that uses attention pooling and a vision transformer to build bag representations.
- Introduces a representation selection subnetwork to choose the bag representation used for classification.

## Evidence extracts
- "             bag representation vector for every individual bag. The proposed method utilizes attention pooling and vision transformer" (Section Abstract)
- "             approaches to generate bag representation vectors. Later, the representation selection subnetwork determines the vector" (Section Abstract)
