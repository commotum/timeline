# Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning (2019)
Source: 692fd2-2019.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a reinforcement learning training approach centered on recurrent experience replay for RNN-based agents in a distributed setting.
- Introduces the R2D2 agent as a methodological contribution, rather than a dataset/benchmark or transformer-specific positional or dimensional change.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper we investigate the training of RNNs with experience replay." (p. 1)
- "We propose a new agent, the Recurrent Replay Distributed DQN (R2D2), and use it to study the interplay between recurrent state, experience replay, and distributed training." (p. 2)
