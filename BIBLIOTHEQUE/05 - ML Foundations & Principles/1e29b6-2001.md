# A Natural Policy Gradient (2001)
Source: 1e29b6-2001.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a natural gradient method for policy-gradient reinforcement learning, linking it to greedy policy improvement.
- Focuses on optimization behavior and empirical performance of the learning method in MDPs (including Tetris).

## Evidence extracts
- "We make the connection to policy iteration by showing that the natural gradient is moving toward choosing a greedy optimal action." (p. 1)
- "Figure 2B shows a drastic improvement using the natural gradient (note that the timescale is linear)." (p. 7)
