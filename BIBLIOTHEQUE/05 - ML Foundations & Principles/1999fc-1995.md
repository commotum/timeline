# Support-Vector Networks (1995)
Source: 1999fc-1995.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces the support-vector network as a new learning machine for two-group classification, focusing on the learning formulation rather than data resources or positional encoding.
- Defines the core method of mapping inputs to a high-dimensional feature space and constructing a linear decision surface with generalization properties, which is a foundational modeling contribution.

## Evidence extracts
- "The support-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems." (p. 1)
- "in this article we construct a new type of learning machine, the so-called support-vector network. The support-vector network implements the following idea: it maps the input vectors into some high dimensional feature space Z through some non-linear mapping chosen a priori." (p. 2)
