Two Cortical Visual Systems

Leslie G. Ungerleider

Damage to the primary visual cortex (striate cortex or area 17), either
by disease, by acute assault, or through surgical intervention for
therapeutic purposes, results in a scotoma or blind region in the visual
field. Moreover, because of the precise topographic mapping of the vi-
sual field onto striate cortex, the region of the scotoma corresponds to
the part of striate cortex damaged. In contrast to this primary sensory
impairment, “higher-order’’ visual dysfunctions ensue when damage oc-
curs more rostrally in the brain, in either the temporal or parietal lobes;
however, the effects that follow lesions of these two cortical areas are
markedly different (Newcombe and Russell 1969). Whereas damage to
temporal cortex produces an impairment in visual recognition (see, for
example, Milner 1958, 1968; Kimura 1963; Lansdell 1968; Benson et al.
1974; Meadows 1974), damage to parietal cortex produces a constellation
of visual spatial impairments (see, for example, McFie et al. 1950;
Semmes et al. 1963; De Renzi and Faglioni 1967; Butters et al. 1972;
Ratcliff and Davies-Jones 1972; Ratcliff and Newcombe 1973).
Although it is clear that visual information must reach the temporal
and parietal association areas to enable their participation in visual rec-
ognition and visual spatial perception, respectively, the complex cir-
cuitry through which this information is transmitted has yet to be un-
raveled. It is known, however, that two major fiber bundles emerge
from occipital cortex and project rostrally in the brain (Flechsig 1896,
1920). One, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, follows a dorsal path,
traversing the posterior parietal region in its course to the frontal lobe;
the other, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, follows a ventral route
into the temporal lobe. It has been our working hypothesis (Mishkin
1972; Pohl 1973) that the ventral or occipitotemporal pathway is
specialized for object perception (identifying what an object is) whereas
the dorsal or occipitoparietal pathway is specialized for spatial percep-
tion (locating where an object is). This distinction between the two
types of visual perception is not new (see, for example, Ingle 1967; Held
1968). In the past, however, the neural mechanisms underlying object
and spatial vision were seen as localized in geniculostriate and
tectofugal systems, respectively (Schneider 1967; Trevarthen 1968).

By contrast, in the present formulation, corticocortical connections
originating in the striate area are viewed as mediating both types of
vision, with two diverging cortical systems replacing the genic-
ulostriate-tectofugal dichotomy. The reasons for stressing cortico-
cortical mechanisms for both types of visual perception in primates
are developed below, but this emphasis is not meant to deny that the
tectofugal system (including the tectofugal pathway to cortex) contrib-
utes to spatial vision, particularly to its visuomotor aspects; it is simply
that, with regard to the perceptual aspects of spatial vision, the tec-
tofugal system in the primate appears to play a subsidiary role. In our
investigations of the two cortical visual systems, we have used the
rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) as our subject and have employed a
combination of behavioral, electrophysiological, and anatomical
techniques.

Occipitotemporal Mechanisms in Object Perception

The results of numerous behavioral studies have demonstrated that
bilateral removal of inferior temporal cortex in monkeys produces a se-
vere impairment in visual-discrimination performance (for reviews see
Gross 1973; Dean 1976; Wilson 1978). In brief, inferior temporal lesions
produce a deficit that is exclusively visual, affecting both the retention
of discriminations acquired prior to surgery and the postoperative ac-
quisition of new discriminations. Among the deficits that have been
reported are those involving hue, brightness, two-dimensional pat-
terns, and three-dimensional shapes. More recent work has shown that
damage to the posterior part of the inferior temporal cortex (area TEO)
interferes mainly with discriminative ability, whereas damage to the
anterior part (area TE) affects primarily visual memory (Iwai and Mish-
kin 1968; Cowey and Gross 1970).

The pathway through which inferior temporal cortex receives visual
information was first suggested on the basis of early neuronographic
data (von Bonin et al. 1942). It had been shown in both the monkey and
chimpanzee that if strychnine is applied to the striate cortex spike dis-
charges can be recorded from a prestriate cortical belt, whereas if
strychnine is applied to any part of this prestriate region spikes can be
recorded in the inferior part of the temporal lobe. These neurono-
graphic findings were later confirmed in a neuroanatomical study
(Kuypers et al. 1965) that employed the Nauta-Gygax (1954) technique
for tracing projections by the silver-staining of degenerating axons after
removal of their cell bodies. As anticipated, it was found that striate
cortex projects to a prestriate cortical belt, which, in turn, projects to the
inferior temporal area. It was also confirmed that each prestriate area
projects across the splenium of the corpus callosum to reach the pre-
striate area of the opposite hemisphere.

These neuronographic and neuroanatomical findings are sche-

matized in figure 18.1. As indicated in the upper diagram, each stri-
ate area transmits visual information, relayed through the prestriate
cortex, to the ipsilateral inferior temporal area; but, in addition, be-
cause of the reciprocal prestriate connections across the corpus
callosum, each striate area also transmits visual information to the con-
tralateral inferior temporal area. The behavioral significance of these
pathways was first demonstrated in a series of crossed-lesion discon-
nection experiments (Mishkin 1966). Since such disconnection studies
are not commonly employed to investigate brain-behavior relation-
ships, a brief explanation of the underlying logic may be in order.
The usual method of identifying the function of a cortical area is to
remove that same area from both hemispheres and then determine what
function has been lost. This method does not reveal whether the func-
tion was lost because it depended on the area (or station) that was
removed or because it depended on a later station along the same
pathway that could no longer operate after the pathway leading to it
was destroyed. Crossed-lesion disconnection studies make it possible
to demonstrate that a pathway with many cortical stations exists. The
method is to remove one of the stations in the postulated pathway on
one side of the brain, and to remove a different one (later in the path-
way) on the other side (see lower diagram of figure 18.1). This leaves

one of each pair in the series intact, and it can often be shown that up to
this point little or no loss in function occurs. However, if the connec-
tions between the two hemispheres are then cut, the functions served
by the stations beyond the cut may be lost. This demonstrates that the
function in question depends not only on the stations themselves, but
also on the connections between them. The same demonstration the-
oretically could have been achieved by cutting the fiber connections
between the stations within each hemisphere, but the complexity of
these connections is so great, and they form such a compact network,
that the method is technically difficult if not impossible.

In the disconnection study referred to above it was found that if an
inferotemporal lesion in one hemisphere was combined serially with
total striate removal in the other, animals continued to perform a
pattern-discrimination task; however, when these asymmetrical or
crossed lesions were followed by transection of the corpus callosum, the
performance of the animals fell to chance and they failed to relearn the
task. Presumably, the single crossed pathway from the intact striate
cortex on one side across the corpus callosum to the intact inferior
temporal cortex on the other side is sufficient to mediate pattern-
discrimination habits, but if this pathway is cut a severe deficit results.
This study thus provided the first behavioral indication that inferior
temporal cortex is a late station along a cortical visual pathway running
from striate through prestriate cortex.

Electrophysiological experiments (Gross et al. 1972) subsequently re-
vealed that single neurons in inferior temporal cortex, like those in
striate (Hubel and Wiesel 1968) and prestriate (Hubel and Wiesel 1970)
cortex, have visual receptive fields. The optimal trigger features for in-
ferior temporal neurons, however, are considerably more complex. That
visual input to these neurons originates in striate cortex was shown ina
combined recording and ablation study by Rocha-Miranda et al. (1975).
The method entailed measuring the defect in the visual receptive fields
of inferior temporal neurons after selective cerebral lesions or commis-
sural transections. As predicted from earlier ablation studies (Mishkin
1972), the tectofugal pathway from the superior colliculus through the
pulvinar to cortex turned out to be unimportant for the receptive field
properties of inferior temporal neurons. By contrast, the cortical path-
way from striate through prestriate to inferior temporal cortex proved to
be essential, since interruption of this pathway by a striate removal
or by transection of the forebrain commissures eliminated the corre-
sponding visual input to inferior temporal cells. The results, shown in
figure 18.2, indicate that normally over 60% of inferior temporal
neurons have bilateral receptive fields. However, after bilateral striate-
cortex removal these neurons are totally unresponsive to visual stimu-
lation, after unilateral striate-cortex removal they respond to visual
stimulation only in the hemifield opposite the intact striate cortex, and
after commissurotomy they respond to stimulation only in the con-

tralateral hemifield. Thus, the dependence of inferior temporal cortex
on corticocortical connections arising in striate cortex has now been
made evident at the single-cell level.

Most recently, this entire visual pathway was functionally mapped
using '*C-labeled 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) via the method developed by
Sokoloff and his colleagues (Kennedy et al. 1975). In this technique
2-DG is used as a marker of local cerebral glucose utilization and hence
indicates regions that are metabolically active during the experimental
procedure. The visual-mapping studies (Jarvis et al. 1978; Kennedy et
al. 1978) were carried out in awake monkeys previously prepared witha
unilateral optic-tract section combined with transection of the forebrain
commissures (a procedure that visually deafferented one hemisphere
while leaving the other intact). On the day of the experiment, the mon-
keys were presented with visual patterns in a rotating drum or ina
discrimination apparatus. In both situations, reduced glucose utiliza-
tion in the blind as compared with the seeing hemisphere was seen

cortically, not only in the geniculostriate projection but throughout the
entire expanse of prestriate and inferior temporal cortex as far forward
as the temporal pole. With one exception, no other cortical area in the
deafferented hemisphere showed reduced activity.

The evidence that has been cited favors a sequential-activation model
for object vision in which information that reaches the striate cortex is
transmitted for further processing to the prestriate cortex, and from
there to the inferior temporal area. This system appears to be important
for the analysis and coding of the physical dimensions of visual stimuli
needed for their identification and recognition. It is unlikely, however,
that any part of this system up to and including the inferior temporal
area is involved in the still higher-order process of associating visual
stimuli with other events, such as motivational and emotional ones.
Recordings from single cells in monkeys performing visual discrimina-
tion and reversal tasks have shown that although inferior temporal
neurons are sensitive to the physical properties of stimuli, they are rel-
atively insensitive to changes in the reward value of the stimuli (Jarvis
and Mishkin 1977). Similar results have been reported by others (Rolls
et al. 1977; but see Ridley and Ettlinger 1973). Presumably, the process
of attaching reward value to a stimulus depends on stations beyond the
occipitotemporal pathway (Jones and Mishkin 1972; Sunshine and Mish-
kin 1975; Spiegler and Mishkin 1978; Rolls et al. 1979b; Sanghera et al.
1979). However, for object vision, the inferior temporal cortex may well
be the final station. It is significant in this regard that, by virtue of the
extremely large receptive fields of inferior temporal neurons (Gross et
al. 1972), this area provides the neural mechanism of stimulus equiva-
lence across retinal translation (Gross and Mishkin 1977; Seacord et al.
1979)—that is, the ability to recognize a stimulus as the same regardless
of its position in the visual field and, by extrapolation, regardless of its
spatial location. Indeed, a necessary consequence of this equivalence
mechanism is that within the occipitotemporal pathway there is a loss
of information about the spatial locations of objects.

Occipitoparietal Mechanisms in Spatial Perception

The neural mechanism for the analysis of the spatial locations of objects
also entails the transmission of visual information from the striate
through the prestriate area; however, the rest of the pathway for spatial
vision appears to be quite separate from the ventral pathway into the
temporal cortex. Evidence in support of this dichotomy of cortical visual
systems comes from recent studies in our laboratory on the parietal
lobe.

In the initial study of this series, Pohl (1973) demonstrated a dissoci-
ation of visual deficits after inferior temporal and posterior parietal
lesions. Whereas the temporal but not the parietal lesion produced a se-
vere impairment on an object discrimination task, just the reverse was

Ungerleider, Mishkin
555

found on tests in which the animal was required to choose a response
location on the basis of its proximity to a visual ‘‘landmark” (see part A
of figure 18.5). The results suggested that “. . . the inferior temporal
cortex participates mainly in the acts of noticing and remembering an
object’s qualities, not its position in space,’”’ and that ‘conversely, the
posterior parietal cortex seems to be concerned with the perception of
spatial relations among objects, and not their intrinsic qualities” (Mish-
kin 1972).

Accumulating evidence from other laboratories supports this view of
posterior parietal function. Not only has the impairment of landmark
tasks after posterior parietal lesions been corroborated (Milner et al.
1977; Ungerleider and Brody 1977; Brody and Pribram 1978; however,
see Ridley and Ettlinger 1975), but impairments after such lesions have
also been found on other visual spatial tasks, including a stylus maze
(Milner et al. 1977), patterned-string tests (Ungerleider and Brody 1977),
cage finding (Sugishita et al. 1978), and route following (Petrides and
Iversen 1979). Visual spatial disorientation, however, is not the only
deficit produced by lesions of this region. Indeed, the classical symp-
toms of posterior parietal dysfunction are misreaching in the dark as
well as in the light (Ettlinger and Wegener 1958; Bates and Ettlinger
1960; Ettlinger and Kalsbeck 1962; Hartje and Ettlinger 1973; LaMotte
and Acuna 1978; Faugier-Grimaud et al. 1978; Stein 1978), contralateral
neglect of auditory and tactile as well as visual stimuli (Denny-Brown
and Chambers 1958; Heilman et al. 1970), and impairments of tactile
discrimination (Blum 1951; Pribram and Barry 1956; Wilson 1957, 1975;
Ettlinger and Wegener 1958; Pasik et al. 1958; Bates and Ettlinger 1960;
Wilson et al. 1960; Ettlinger and Kalsbeck 1962; Ettlinger et al. 1966;
Moffett et al. 1967; Moffett and Ettlinger 1970; Ridley and Ettlinger
1975).

The posterior parietal lesions in these studies have nearly always in-
cluded two or even more cytoarchitectonic areas, and so it is natural to
assume that the heterogeneity of effects is a consequence of the het-
erogeneity of the tissue included in the removals. However, the few
studies that have directly examined this question (Moffett et al. 1967;
Ridley and Ettlinger 1975) failed to uncover any clear-cut instance of
functional dissociation. From the evidence at hand, the most par-
simonious interpretation is one that has been offered by Semmes
(1967), namely, that the multiple deficits are but different reflections
of a single, supramodal spatial disorder (see also Ratcliff et al. 1977).
According to this view, and in the light of more recent anatomical in-
formation (Pandya and Kuypers 1969; Jones and Powell 1970), a su-
pramodal spatial framework could be constructed out of converging
inputs to posterior parietal cortex from all exteroceptive sensory mo-
dalities, with a significant contribution from vision. In the studies in our
laboratory that followed the “landmark” experiment by Pohl (1973), we
addressed the questions raised above regarding localization of spatial

function within the posterior parietal region and the dependence of this
function on visual inputs.

As in most other posterior parietal ablation studies, the lesions in
Pohl’s study were composites that included not only inferior parietal
but also dorsal prestriate tissue. To test for localization of function
within this region, we partitioned it into three approximately equal
sectors—inferior parietal, lateral preoccipital, and medial parietal-
preoccipital—as shown in figure 18.3. Monkeys were then prepared
with lesions of either one, two, or all three of these sectors and tested on
the landmark, or distance discrimination, task (Mishkin, Lewis, and
Ungerleider, in prep.). Like the earlier attempts, this one failed to reveal
any evidence of functional specialization within the larger area. In-
stead, there was an especially clear relationship between severity of ef-
fect and extent of lesion, completely independent of locus. This finding
is illustrated in figure 18.4.

The fact that performance on the landmark task depends as much on
dorsal prestriate tissue as on inferior parietal tissue pointed to the pos-
sibility that the visual information on which posterior parietal cortex
operates arises in striate cortex. The alternative possibility, that the
critical visual input arises in the superior colliculus, found no clear sup-
port in a study of the effects of tectal lesions on landmark discrimination
(Snyder and Mishkin, unpublished data); even complete destruction of
the superior colliculus failed to produce a reliable loss in retention.
Therefore, to test for the functional dependence of posterior parietal
cortex on striate output, a crossed-lesion disconnection experiment
analogous to the striate-temporal disconnection experiment described
earlier (Mishkin 1966) was undertaken (Ungerleider and Mishkin
1978a). Monkeys were preoperatively trained on the landmark task, and
then received a three-stage operation intended to serially disconnect
posterior parietal from striate cortex. At each stage, the monkeys were
given a preoperative retention test followed by surgery, allowed 2
weeks to recover, and then retested.

As shown in part B of figure 18.5, the first removal was a unilateral
posterior parietal ablation, which included all three sectors investigated
in the partial-lesion study to ensure a complete effect. On the hypothe-
sis that each striate area has corticocortical connections with both poste-
rior parietal areas, this first lesion may be viewed as a test of the effects
of destroying two of these connections (the remaining two are indicated
by the black arrows in the figure). A comparison of preoperative with
postoperative retention scores on the task shows that this amount of
damage to the system had only minimal effect.

The second-stage removal was a contralateral striate-cortex ablation,
illustrated in part C of figure 18.5. It included all of the striate cortex,
both laterally and medially. The results of the retest given after this
operation revealed a severe impairment; the monkeys required an aver-
age of 880 trials to relearn, despite the remaining interhemispheric cor-

tical connections between the intact striate and parietal areas. This
suggested that the interaction between the striate and parietal cortex via
uncrossed connections had been of considerable importance for per-
formance. However, whether such interaction was mediated by a cor-
ticocortical pathway could only be determined by examining the effects
of the third stage of operation, transection of the corpus callosum.

In this operation, the posterior half of the callosum was transected,
thereby cortically disconnecting the intact striate and posterior parietal
areas. As shown by the postoperative retention score in part D of figure
18.5, the effect of the transection was to produce a partial reinstatement
of the impairment. We can infer from these results that performance on
the landmark task had indeed been mediated via corticocortical path-
ways between the striate and parietal areas.

However, the disruption of landmark discrimination that followed
this lesion was not complete; all monkeys successfully relearned the
task. At this point, the question was whether recovery of the discrimi-
nation was mediated by the interaction of the intact posterior parietal
cortex with subcortical visual structures or by the interaction of the in-
tact striate cortex with other cortical areas. In subsequent work on this
preparation we found that removal of the remaining posterior parietal
cortex was completely without effect, which indicated that tectofugal

inputs to this cortex, which appear to be unnecessary when corticocor-
tical connections are intact, also play no significant role in the recovery
after corticocortical disconnection. By contrast, removal of prestriate
cortex ipsilateral to the intact striate cortex produced a marked impair-
ment on the task. Taken together, the results of this serial-lesion ex-
periment demonstrate that the visual spatial functions of posterior
parietal cortex depend on inputs from striate cortex and that such inputs
are transmitted across corticocortical pathways. In this regard, it is sig-
nificant that the only cortical area apart from those along the oc-
cipitotemporal pathway to show differential glucose utilization in the
2-DG experiments described earlier (Jarvis et al. 1978; Kennedy et al.
1978) was located within the posterior parietal region. The affected area
extended forward from the dorsal prestriate cortex to include the poste-
rior half of the inferior parietal gyrus, both on its crown and on the
ventral bank of the intraparietal sulcus.

The Two Cortical Visual Systems Compared

These results on striate-parietal interaction parallel the earlier finding
that corticocortical inputs from striate cortex are crucial for the visual
recognition functions of inferior temporal cortex. But, though the re-
sults of these two studies are analogous, one important difference
emerges (see figure 18.6). On the pattern-discrimination task of the ear-
lier study, only a moderate effect followed the striate lesion, and a se-
vere deficit did not result until the callosal transection. By contrast, on
the landmark task, the relative effects of the striate and callosal lesions
were reversed; that is, the striate-cortex lesion produced the more se-
vere effect. These data suggest that the posterior parietal cortex, like the
inferior temporal, depends heavily on corticocortical inputs from striate
cortex for its visual function, but that, unlike the inferior temporal, the
posterior parietal cortex in a given hemisphere does not seem to receive
a heavy input via the corpus callosum from striate-cortex neurons rep-
resenting the ipsilateral visual field. Thus, each posterior parietal area
may be organized largely as a substrate for contralateral spatial func-
tion, and this could account in part for the symptom of contralateral
neglect that has so often been reported after unilateral injury to the
parietal lobe in man (see, for example, Denny-Brown and Chambers
1958).

A second important difference in the organization of visual inputs to
the two systems was uncovered in an experiment comparing the be-
havioral effects of selective striate-cortex removals. In this experiment,
monkeys received bilateral lesions of the striate area representing either
central vision (lateral striate) or peripheral vision (medial striate). The
lateral lesion included the entire lateral surface of striate cortex, and the
medial lesion included the calcarine fissure as well as both banks of its
ascending and descending limbs (figure 18.7). The monkeys were tested

before operation both on a pattern-discrimination task, to assess re-
sidual inferior temporal function, and on the landmark task, to assess
residual posterior parietal function. For purposes of comparison, their
scores are plotted in figure 18.8 together with those of monkeys with
either bilateral inferior temporal or bilateral posterior parietal lesions

The data indicate that on the pattern-discrimination task severe im-
pairment was produced by inferior temporal but not by posterior
parietal lesions, whereas on the landmark task severe impairment fol-
lowed posterior parietal but not inferior temporal lesions. This, then, is
another instance of the dissociation of visual recognition and visual
spatial functions of temporal and parietal cortex, respectively. Of more
direct concern for the question of differences in anatomical organiza-
tion, however, were the effects of the striate lesions. Here the data indi-
cate that on the pattern-discrimination task impairment was produced
only by lateral striate-cortex lesions, whereas on the landmark task
equally severe impairment followed lateral and medial striate-cortex le-
sions. Apparently, inputs from central vision are especially important
for the visual recognition functions of the inferior temporal cortex, but
inputs from central and peripheral vision are equally important for the
visual spatial functions of posterior parietal cortex.

Thus, although interactions with striate cortex are critical for the
parietal just as for the temporal area, the inputs of the striate cortex to
these two regions appear to be organized differently; relative to inferior
temporal cortex, posterior parietal cortex receives a smaller contribution
from contralateral striate-cortex inputs (representing the ipsilateral vi-
sual field) but a greater contribution from medial inputs (representing

rior parietal cortex. Axes represent horizontal and vertical meridians. Plus sign indicates
upper or right visual field; minus sign indicates lower or left. Scale is in degrees of visual
angle. A slow-moving stimulus typically effective in activating the given population of
neurons is shown at the left of each diagram. The enclosed geometric shape within each

tion. Note that of the inferior temporal neurons over 60% are bilateral, 100% include the
fovea, and there is selectivity for stimulus features; of the posterior parietal neurons over
60% are contralateral only, over 60% do not include the fovea, and there is no selectivity
for stimulus features. (Part A adapted from Gross et al. 1972; part B adapted from Robin-

the peripheral visual field). Interestingly, these differences in the or-
ganization of striate-cortex inputs inferred from the ablation studies are
clearly reflected in the receptive-field properties of neurons within the
inferior temporal (Gross et al. 1972; Jarvis and Mishkin 1975; Rolls et al.
1977) and posterior parietal areas (Hyvarinen and Poranen 1974;
Mountcastle et al. 1975; Robinson et al. 1978; Rolls et al. 1979a). The
relevant properties are shown diagrammatically in figure 18.9.

First, there is a smaller representation of the ipsilateral visual field in
the receptive fields of posterior parietal neurons than in those of in-
ferior temporal neurons: Over 60% of inferior temporal neurons have
bilateral receptive fields, while over 60% of posterior parietal neurons
have contralateral fields only. Second, there is a relatively greater repre-
sentation of the peripheral visual field in the receptive fields of poste-
rior parietal neurons than in those of inferior temporal neurons: 100%
of inferior temporal neurons have receptive fields that include the
fovea, while over 60% of posterior parietal neurons have receptive
fields outside the fovea. Finally, and perhaps most important, not only
are the striate-cortex inputs to the temporal and parietal areas organized
differently, but these inputs must also be carrying different information
to the two areas, as is indicated by the behavioral evidence for func-
tional dissociation. This too is clearly seen at the level of single neurons,
for, in contrast to the specific and often complex trigger features needed
for maximal activation of inferior temporal neurons (see, for example,
Gross et al. 1972), most posterior parietal neurons can be maximally
driven by simple spots of light (see Robinson et al. 1978). These several
differences in the receptive-field properties of inferior temporal and
posterior parietal neurons, each of which has a behavioral correlate that
was revealed in the ablation studies, presumably reflect differences in
the cortical processing required for object versus spatial vision.

Corticocortical Pathways Through Prestriate Cortex

The evidence presented thus far strongly supports the view that neural
mechanisms underlying object and spatial perception depend on the
relay of different kinds of visual information from striate cortex through
prestriate cortex to targets in inferior temporal and posterior parietal
areas, respectively. Despite the abundance of positive evidence, how-
ever, the support has not been unanimous. The results of prestriate-
cortex ablation studies have repeatedly raised serious problems for this
conception of corticocortical pathways. If prestriate cortex were an es-
sential relay in either a striate-temporal or a striate-parietal pathway,
then damage to this relay should yield effects at least as severe as dam-
age to its target areas. Yet, monkeys sustaining extensive bilateral pre-
striate lesions commonly exhibit only mild visual effects. In a few in-
stances in which severe visual deficits did follow prestriate removals
(Keating and Horel 1972; Keating 1975), the removals included the pos-
terior part of inferior temporal cortex (area TEO), damage to which, by
itself, produces severe visual-discrimination impairment (Iwai and
Mishkin 1968). Extensive prestriate-cortex removals that spare this
posterior temporal region, however, have repeatedly failed to yield ap-
preciable effects in either visual discrimination or in spatial orientation
(Lashley 1948; Meyer et al. 1951; Riopelle et al. 1951; Chow 1952; Evarts
1952; Pribram et al. 1969; Ungerleider and Pribram 1977).

Is there a resolution of this paradox? It was suggested by Mishkin
(1966) that failures to obtain severe impairments after extensive pre-
striate-cortex removals simply indicated that spared prestriate rem-
nants continued to serve as effective relays between the striate area and
its rostral targets—that is, that the prestriate cortex was invested with
a high degree of equipotentiality. According to this proposal, only a
complete prestriate lesion would be expected to yield a corticocortical
disconnection. The results of a study by Iwai and Mishkin (Mishkin
1972) provided support for this proposal with regard to occipitotem-
poral transmission. When putatively complete prestriate-cortex lesions
were made in a large group of monkeys, none was able to relearn a
visual pattern discrimination. By contrast, partial prestriate ablations,
irrespective of their location, were nearly without effect. These findings
therefore pointed to the existence of multiple pathways through pre-
striate cortex, any of which can be utilized to convey visual information
out of striate cortex. It seemed that only if all these equivalent pathways
were destroyed would the transmission be completely disrupted and
the anticipated deficit ensue.

Although it has since been found that even the massive removals
of prestriate cortex referred to above did not totally disconnect the
striate-temporal pathway, the conclusion reached remains valid none-
theless. Indeed, it has now been demonstrated that any sparing, no
matter how minimal, of the visual functions of inferior temporal cor-

tex after a prestriate ablation is directly attributable to the continued
relay of information across a viable prestriate pathway. This demon-
stration emerged from a series of interrelated behavioral, electro-
physiological, and anatomical experiments (Ungerleider, Iwai, Gross,
Bender, Snyder, and Mishkin, in prep.) that began in the follow-
ing way: In an attempt to verify that the inferior temporal cortex had
been functionally disconnected in the Iwai-Mishkin study, two of the
monkeys that had failed to show relearning after the prestriate lesions
were given prolonged pattern-discrimination training by a method of
approximation, in preparation for a second-stage lesion. The method
entailed presentation of a series of stimulus pairs that differed first in
brightness, then in size, then in contour, and finally in pattern; the
successive pattern pairs approximated the originals more and more
closely until the original pattern discrimination had been relearned.
Over several months both monkeys were successfully retrained by this
method, and both were then given bilateral inferior temporal ablations
in a second-stage operation. The supposition was that if the initial pre-
striate removal had produced a total disconnection of inferior temporal
from striate cortex, then the slow pattern-discrimination relearning by
approximation should have been achieved without the participation of
inferior temporal cortex, and, consequently, removal of this cortex
should not disrupt the relearned habit. As it turned out, however, the
inferior temporal ablation produced a complete reinstatement of the
deficit in both monkeys. Thus, unless inferior temporal cortex can par-
ticipate in visual discrimination learning in the absence of all cor-
ticocortical visual input, the only conclusion to be drawn from this
unexpected result is that the initial prestriate-cortex removal had not
produced a total striate-temporal disconnection after all.

In order to examine directly this question of preserved neural trans-
mission despite massive prestriate removals, an electrophysiological
study was undertaken in animals prepared with removals identical to
those in the Iwai-Mishkin study except that they were limited to one
hemisphere. The distribution of the receptive fields of inferior temporal
neurons in the operated animals is summarized in figure 18.10. Accord-
ing to the proposed route of visual information flow, indicated by the
arrows in the brain diagrams, these neurons should have responded to
visual stimulation only in the hemifield opposite the intact prestriate
cortex. That is, inferior temporal neurons in the intact hemisphere
should have had strictly contralateral visual fields, while inferior tem-
poral neurons in the hemisphere with the prestriate ablation should
have had strictly ipsilateral fields. In short, the results should have du-
plicated those obtained after unilateral striate removals, illustrated in
parts C and D of figure 18.2. In fact, however, the receptive fields of
approximately 25% of the neurons sampled did not fit this prediction.

In the normal monkey, stimulation in a given hemifield will activate
about 80% of inferior temporal neurons. For example, as indicated in

part A of figure 18.2, stimulation in the right hemifield will activate
about 90% of the inferior temporal neurons in the left hemisphere (all
those with either bilateral or contralateral visual fields) and about 70%
of the inferior temporal neurons in the right hemisphere (all those with
either bilateral or ipsilateral visual fields). By contrast, in the animals
with left prestriate removals, stimulation in the right hemifield acti-
vated about 25% of inferior temporal neurons. That is, as indicated in
figure 18.10, right-hemifield stimulation activated about 15% of the in-
ferior temporal neurons in the left hemisphere and about 35% in the
right. Thus, the massive prestriate removals did greatly reduce the vi-
sual input to inferior temporal neurons—in fact, by more than two-
thirds (80% to 25%)—thereby accounting for the severe deficit that
such lesions produced in pattern discrimination relearning. On the
other hand, the removals did not completely eliminate striate input to
inferior temporal neurons (25%, as compared with 0% after striate re-
movals), and this fact accounted for the ultimately successful retraining
by approximation that was achieved in the animals with such lesions.
Even with this electrophysiological evidence, the conclusion that be-

havioral sparing resulted from sparing of remnants of the prestriate
relay was only inferential. In an attempt to demonstrate the preserved
pathway directly, a neuroanatomical experiment was undertaken on
two additional monkeys with massive prestriate removals that had been
successfully retrained by approximation on the pattern discrimination.
More than a year after the prestriate-cortex removals, one of these ani-
mals was given a second-stage operation in which the entire occipital
lobe posterior to the initial lesion was removed from one hemisphere,
and the brain was examined for anterograde degeneration by the
Fink-Heimer (1967) technique. The critical question was whether de-
generation would appear in the inferior temporal cortex ipsilateral to
the occipital lobectomy. Since striate cortex does not project directly to
the inferior temporal area, the presence of degeneration here would in-
dicate that the lobectomy had destroyed prestriate-relay tissue spared
by the initial lesion—a finding that would account for the functional
sparing that had been demonstrated both behaviorally and elec-
trophysiologically. In fact, terminal degeneration did result in the ip-
silateral inferior temporal cortex, specifically in the ventral part of area
TEO. In addition, degenerating material was found in an unexpected
area, the floor of the caudal portion of the superior temporal sulcus,
which turned out to be a second spared route through which visual
input could reach inferior temporal cortex. This was demonstrated in
the other monkey of the anatomical experiment, which was given a
second-stage lesion in just this portion of the superior temporal sulcus
of one hemisphere, again more than a year after the initial prestriate
removal. Terminal degeneration was found in the ipsilateral inferior
temporal cortex of this case also, specifically in the dorsal part of area
TEO.

The foregoing series of experiments made it clear that, although the
massive prestriate-cortex removals had severely disrupted the prestriate
relay, they had not totally abolished it. As illustrated in figure 18.11,
spared pathways that presumably continued to serve as effective relays
were directly demonstrated anatomically. At the same time, however,
the anatomical results raised some important new questions. For exam-
ple, what were the loci of the spared prestriate remnants whose removal
gave rise to the degeneration in the ventral part of area TEO? Also, what
was the source of the unexpected degeneration in the depth of the
caudal portion of the superior temporal sulcus, an area from which a
projection had been traced to dorsal TEO? These questions highlighted
our lack of knowledge about the precise links through which visual in-
formation originating in the striate cortex is transmitted to inferior
temporal cortex. Even greater ignorance surrounded the location and
arrangement of the links in the striate-parietal pathway. It became ap-
parent that, in order to obtain this information, a comprehensive
anatomical investigation was needed, beginning with an analysis of the
projections of the striate cortex itself.

lobectomy was found in ventral area TEO and in the floor of the caudal portion of the

terminate (indicated by question mark). In the second experiment, the floor of the

Clarification of Striate-Prestriate Connections

Early attempts to examine striate-prestriate connections (von Bonin et
al. 1942; Bailey et al. 1944) employed the method of strychnine
neuronography, described above. Although the map of striate projec-
tions obtained with this method has been confirmed by more recent
work using degeneration (Kuypers et al. 1965; Cragg and Ainsworth
1969; Zeki 1969, 1971a; Jones and Powell 1970) and autoradiographic
(Zeki 1976) and horseradish-peroxidase (Lund et al. 1975) tracing tech-
niques, all these methods, both old and new, have been used to define
projections primarily from lateral striate cortex, the part of striate cortex
representing central vision. Surprisingly, there has been almost no in-
formation regarding the projections from posterior and medial striate
cortex, the parts representing peripheral and far-peripheral vision. In-
deed, it was undoubtedly the near absence of information about the
location of the prestriate tissue serving noncentral vision that accounted
for the repeated failure, recounted above, to completely disconnect the
higher-order visual areas from their striate input. We therefore under-
took a study of the cortical efferents from all parts of striate cortex, with
the aim of defining the locus, extent, and topographic organization of
the entire striate-prestriate projection system.

To delineate the entire map of striate projections to prestriate cortex,
one series of monkeys was prepared with partial striate lesions such
that, collectively, they included all of area 17 with little or no invasion of
area 18. The brains were then processed by the Fink-Heimer (1967) pro-
cedure for silver staining of degenerating axon terminals. Reconstruc-
tions of the lesions in three of the five cases from this series are shown

Ungerleider, Mishkin

in figure 18.12. The lateral lesion involved the lateral surface of area 17
only, with no invasion of area 18; the posterior lesion included the lat-
eral and medial banks of the vertical limbs of the calcarine fissure, again
with no invasion of area 18; and the medial striate lesion involved the
tissue within the stem of the calcarine fissure, in this case with slight
damage to area 18 around the lips of the fissure. According to the eiec-
trophysiological map of Daniel and Whitteridge (1961), these three sec-
tors of striate cortex correspond to the central 7° of the contralateral
visual field, to the field between 7° and 22° from fixation, and to eccen-
tricities greater than 22° from fixation, respectively (see figure 18.13).
Thus, it was anticipated that not only would the entire striate-prestriate
projection system emerge from the data on this series of monkeys, but
the general visuotopic organization of the system would be apparent as
well.

To verify the degeneration results, and also to investigate the details
of the visuotopic organization, a second series of monkeys were pre-
pared with injections of radioactively labeled amino acids into selected
sites in striate cortex, and the brains processed for autoradiography. A
summary of the injection sites is shown in figure 18.14. These loci cor-
respond to positions in the visual field ranging from less than 12° from
fixation (site number 1 on the lateral surface) to greater than 45° from
fixation (site number 10 in the stem of the calcarine fissure). The loci
injected included representations of both the upper and the lower vi-
sual fields.

The results from both sets of experiments, degeneration and auto-
radiographic, indicated that all parts of striate cortex project to three
separate visual areas within prestriate cortex (Ungerleider and Mishkin
1979a): The first is a circumstriate cortical belt surrounding area 17 at
the 17-18 border, the second is located along the caudal portion of the
superior temporal sulcus, and the third is buried deep within the caudal
part of the intraparietal sulcus. Each of these three projection areas will
be described in turn.

Within the first projection area—the circumstriate cortical belt—the
representations of the upper and lower visual fields are entirely sepa-
rate (figure 18.15). The topographic organization of these separate rep-
resentations is illustrated in figure 18.16. Progression from central to
peripheral to far peripheral vision is represented in the lower field bya
progression into the posterior bank and depth of the lunate sulcus, me-
dially along the surface of the buried annectent gyrus into the parieto-
occipital incisure, and then rostrally along the upper lip of the calcarine
fissure; and in the upper field by a progression into the inferior occipi-
tal sulcus, ventromedially into the occipitotemporal and collateral sulci,
and then rostrally along the lower lip of the calcarine fissure. The total
extent of this projection field corresponds remarkably closely to area OB
of von Bonin and Bailey (1947); indeed, the two may be equivalent.
Moreover, the autoradiographic evidence indicates that whereas the

center of gaze (fixation) is represented in the far anterolateral part of striate cortex, just below the ventral tip
of the lunate sulcus. The representation of the vertical meridian passes through fixation (X) and continues all
along the 17-18 border (dashed line). The representation of the horizontal meridian is a horizontal line (not

continuing to the rostral limit of the medial striate cortex (dashed arrow). The upper visual field is repre-
sented below the horizontal meridian and the lower visual field above the horizontal meridian. The lateral
surface of striate cortex (A), the lateral bank of the calcarine limbs (B), the medial bank of the calcarine limbs
(C, D), and the stem of the calcarine fissure (E, F) represent approximately the center 7°, 7°-13°, 13°-22°, and
eccentricities greater than 22° from fixation, respectively. Thus, a progression from lateral to posterior to

vertical meridian is represented at the inner boundary of this projection
field (that is, at the striate-OB border), the horizontal meridian is repre-
sented at its outer boundary (at the OB-OA border).

The second projection field of striate cortex is located within cytoar-
chitectonic area OA along the caudal portion of the superior temporal
sulcus (Ungerleider and Mishkin 1978b, 1979b). As indicated in the lat-
eral view of the brain shown in figure 18.17, the ventral limit of this
region can be demarcated by an imaginary line connecting the ventral
tips of the lunate and intraparietal sulci; from this limit the region ex-
tends dorsocaudally for about 1 cm to the point at which the superior
temporal sulcus frequently bifurcates, sending one spur forward into
the inferior parietal lobule. Within this portion of the superior temporal
sulcus there is again an orderly mapping of the contralateral visual field,

as shown on the three selected cross sections. Progression from central
to peripheral to far-peripheral vision is represented by a progression
down the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus and up along
the lower and then the upper part of the sulcal floor. Figure 18.18 sum-
marizes this topographic arrangement. The finding that the floor of the
superior temporal sulcus receives a direct projection from posterior and
medial striate cortex provides an answer to one of the anatomical ques-
tions posed in the preceding section (see figure 18.11). As yet, however,
we do not have an answer to the second question raised there, except
the confirmation that the immediate source of the occipital projections
to ventral area TEO is not the striate cortex.

The third area that receives direct striate-cortex projections is also
located within cytoarchitectonic area OA, in the depth of the most
caudal portion of the intraparietal sulcus. A cross-section through the
projection shows that it is buried in the foot-shaped part of the sulcus
beneath its lateral bank (figure 18.19). This projection field is by far the
smallest of the three; its total rostral-caudal length extends only about 2
mm. There is no discernible topographic representation of the visual
field within this area, for after a lesion or an injection involving any part
of striate cortex a projection is always seen in the same part of the sul-
cus. Thus, although the dark-field photomicrograph in figure 18.19
shows degeneration in the foot of the intraparietal sulcus after a medial
striate lesion, the very same picture could as well represent the projec-
tions of either posterior or lateral striate cortex. Indeed, the first evi-
dence of direct striate projections to this area came from studies that

had examined only lateral striate connections (Kuypers et al. 1965; Jones
and Powell 1970), though the area had not been recognized as a separate
projection field at that time.

These three projection fields thus comprise all the possible first-stage
prestriate relays through which striate output can reach the inferior
temporal and posterior parietal cortex. Undoubtedly, second- and
third-stage prestriate relays also participate in both corticocortical
pathways (Zeki 1971b; Mesulam et al. 1977; Stanton et al. 1977; Desi-
mone et al. 1980), although the exact location and topographic ar-
rangement of these further relays remain to be delineated. But even
from the evidence pertaining to the first stage alone, we can begin to
understand why attempts to produce striate-temporal disconnection by
removal of prestriate cortex have repeatedly failed. In all prestriate-

the projection zone, it is also discernible caudally. Numerals refer to approximate A-P stereotaxic levels. For

ablation studies, certain areas have consistently been spared that can
now be identified as receiving direct projections from posterior and
medial striate cortex. These prestriate areas are the medial portion of
area OB (figure 18.16), the floor of the caudal portion of the superior
temporal sulcus (figure 18.17), and the depth of the most caudal portion
of the intraparietal sulcus (figure 18.19). Each of these three areas has
escaped damage for a different reason: the first because of its relative
inaccessibility, the second because it was not even recognized to be a
part of prestriate cortex, and the third because its precise location had
not been described. In light of the nearly complete sparing of these
areas in most ablation studies, the finding of only mild visual impair-
ment is no longer surprising. Only when these areas were invaded sub-
stantially, as in the massive prestriate removals of the Iwai-Mishkin
study, did severe visual impairment result. However, even in those le-

sions, where there was almost total destruction of the prestriate areas
that receive direct projections from lateral striate cortex (the part repre-
senting central vision), there was no more than 50% destruction (Un-
gerleider et al., in prep.) of the prestriate areas that receive direct pro-
jections from posterior and medial striate cortex (the parts representing
peripheral and far peripheral vision). Clearly, it was the sparing of this
tissue that accounted for the continued (though reduced) transmission
of visual information to inferior temporal cortex that had been demon-
strated not only behaviorally but also electrophysiologically. Thus, the
present anatomical findings, many of which have now been confirmed
by others (Weller and Kaas 1978; Maunsell et al. 1979; Rockland 1979;
Van Essen et al. 1979; Weller et al. 1979), provide a coherent explanation
for a large body of seemingly paradoxical results regarding the effects of
prestriate lesions. That is, just as “peripheral” striate cortex can mediate
pattern discrimination in the absence of “central” striate cortex (Blake et

cated in the depth of the most caudal portion of the sulcus. Its approximate A-P level is
indicated by the vertical line on the lateral view of the hemisphere, and its depth by the
black square on the cross-section. The dark-field photomicrograph shows the locus of

al. 1977), so can ‘peripheral’ prestriate cortex substitute for “central”
prestriate cortex in this function. And if this is the case for the visual
recognition functions of inferior temporal cortex, where inputs from
peripheral vision are less important than those from central vision, then
the same must surely be true for the visual spatial functions of posterior
parietal cortex, where inputs from peripheral vision are equal in im-
portance to those from central vision (see figure 18.8).

Now that the total system of striate efferents has been delineated, the
effects of completely disconnecting temporal or parietal from striate
cortex can finally be investigated. Such disconnection should be
achievable by removal of just the three striate projection fields that have
been described, without inclusion of any other prestriate tissue. In ad-
dition, with special testing methods it may now be possible to study the
behavioral effects of prestriate-cortex damage without producing total

disconnection. In view of the visuotopic organization of the striate
projection zones in both area OB and the caudal part of the superior
temporal sulcus, the details of which have been corroborated elec-
trophysiologically (Gattass and Gross 1979; Gattass et al. 1979), even
limited lesions within these prestriate zones should yield severe visual
deficits if the animals are forced to use the part of the visual field corre-
sponding to the area damaged. Testing of visual functions within

specified parts of the visual field can be accomplished in monkeys who.

have been trained to maintain fixation (Wurtz 1969). Thus, the combi-
nation of this method and the use of lesions based on our new under-
standing of prestriate anatomy offers a promising approach for the
study of the processing characteristics and functional organization of
prestriate cortex.

Summary and Conclusions

The hypothesis that has been guiding our research is that appreciation
of an object’s qualities and of its spatial location depends on the pro-
cessing of different kinds of visual information in the inferior temporal
and posterior parietal cortex, respectively. From an initial concern with
these higher-order visual areas, our research has proceeded backward.
Having first obtained strong support from ablation studies for the pos-
tulated dichotomy of temporal and parietal function, we next examined
the pathways through which visual information reaches these two cor-
tical areas. Converging evidence from a variety of sources—behavioral
and electrophysiological disconnection experiments as well as anatomi-
cal and metabolic mapping studies—indicated that both the temporal
and parietal visual areas depend on corticocortical inputs relayed from
striate through prestriate cortex. The results of prestriate ablation
studies, however, conflicted with this conclusion, since they commonly
indicated only modest deficits in both visual recognition and spatial
orientation. The solution to this puzzle emerged from a series of inter-
related behavioral, electrophysiological, and anatomical experiments
that demonstrated that every case of functional sparing after prestriate
damage can be directly attributed to the continued relay of information
through viable prestriate remnants. To determine the locus of these pre-
striate remnants, we turned to a study of the cortical efferents from all
parts of striate cortex. The results revealed that all prestriate lesions to
date, no matter how massive, have failed to include varying extents of
tissue that receive direct projections from posterior and medial striate
cortex, the parts representing peripheral vision. Having delineated the
projections of striate cortex, which were found to consist of three sepa-
rate re-representations of the visual field, we are now ina position to
proceed in a forward direction and follow these projections, with the
inferior temporal and posterior parietal cortex as our targets. In the
course of this endeavor, a major goal will be to determine where within

the complex of prestriate cortex the two cortical visual systems begin to
diverge. On the assumption that both systems can indeed be followed
stepwise to our target areas, not only in the temporal but also in the
parietal lobe, a major question for the future will be how the object and
spatial information carried in these two separated systems are sub-
sequently integrated into a unified visual percept.
