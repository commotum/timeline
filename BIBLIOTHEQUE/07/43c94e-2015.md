# The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks (2015)
Source: 43c94e-2015.pdf

## Core reasons
- The document is an informal blog post about recurrent neural networks and character-level language modeling, not a Transformer-focused contribution.
- It shares examples and released code rather than presenting a new model architecture, benchmark, or measurement framework.

## Evidence extracts
- "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks" (p. 1)
- "This post is about sharing some of that magic with you." (p. 1)
- "You can train your own models using the char-rnn code I released on Github (under MIT license)." (p. 2)
