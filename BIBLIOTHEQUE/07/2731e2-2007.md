# The Hidden Logic of Sudoku Second Edition (2007)
Source: 2731e2-2007.pdf

## Core reasons
- The document is explicitly a book about Sudoku and its resolution methods rather than any machine-learning model, benchmark, or training method.
- Its core contribution is a formalisation of Sudoku solving in predicate logic, indicating a symbolic-logic focus outside the ML taxonomy.

## Evidence extracts
- "The Hidden Logic of Sudoku Second Edition" (p. 1)
- "All the concepts were formalised in Predicate Logic (FOL), which (surprisingly) was a new idea: all the books and Web forums had always considered Propositional Logic was enough." (p. 11)
