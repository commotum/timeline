# Point-voxel dual transformer for LiDAR 3D object detection (2025)
Source: c7d102-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a transformer-based framework (PV-DT3D) for LiDAR 3D object detection, applying transformers to 3D spatial data.
- The main contribution is a point-voxel dual transformer architecture designed for point cloud processing in 3D detection.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, a two-stage light detection and ranging (LiDAR) three-dimensional (3D) object detection framework is
presented, namely point-voxel dual transformer (PV-DT3D), which is a transformer-based method." (p. 1)
- "Due to the inherent permutation  invariant,  transformer
has  been  an  ideal  model  to  process  point  clouds." (p. 3)
