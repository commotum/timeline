                           correspond to the words in the source sentence (English) and the generated translation (French),
                           respectively. Each pixel shows the weight α  of the annotation of the j-th source word for the i-th

                           randomlyselected samples among the sentences without any unknown words and of length between
                           10and20wordsfromthetestset.
                           One of the motivations behind the proposed approach was the use of a ﬁxed-length context vector
                           in the basic encoder–decoder approach. We conjectured that this limitation may make the basic
                           encoder–decoder approach to underperform with long sentences. In Fig. 2, we see that the perfor-
                           manceofRNNencdecdramaticallydropsasthelengthofthesentencesincreases. Ontheotherhand,
                           both RNNsearch-30 and RNNsearch-50 are more robust to the length of the sentences. RNNsearch-
                           50, especially, shows no performance deterioration even with sentences of length 50 or more. This
                           superiority of the proposed model over the basic encoder–decoder is further conﬁrmed by the fact
                           that the RNNsearch-30 even outperforms RNNencdec-50 (see Table 1).
