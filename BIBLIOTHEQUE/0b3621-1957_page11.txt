Some general principles of organization should be clear
from this table.

(1) The table is organized into three independent sections,
one for every independent set of responses. Each of these sections

consists of an SeA matrix and an A-R matrix.

(2) Within the matrix of S-A connections for each response
set, it is desirable that each column should have a unique permutation
of positive and negative connections,

(3) The numbers of positive and negative connections are the
same in every colum of the matrix.

(hi) Each A-set connects to only one Reset.

(5) Each row of an A-R sub-matrix should have a unique

permutation of connections.

(6) All elements of an A-R sub-matrix which do not represent
excitatory connections are filled in with inhibitory connections from

R to A, provided the A's and R's are of the same set,

Electronic schematics are shown in Fig. 5 for a typical
A-unit and an R-unit which would meet the logical requirements of the
model, The value of the A-unit is controlled by an integrator, which
gains a slight increment every time the unit is active, and which governs
the gain of the output pulse-generator, In such a system, the amplitude
of the output pulse is equivalent to the value, The gas tube in the
input line triggers the A-unit when the value of 9 is exceeded, provided

the gate is not closed by signals from the R-units.
