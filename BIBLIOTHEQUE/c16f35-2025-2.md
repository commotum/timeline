# DT-NVS: Diffusion Transformers for Novel View Synthesis (2025)
Source: c16f35-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a transformer-based diffusion model for novel view synthesis, applying a transformer backbone to generate views of scenes from a single image.
- Centers on 3D-aware modeling (radiance field / multiview images), adapting transformers to a higher-dimensional visual/3D domain.

## Evidence extracts
- "We propose DT-NVS, a novel view synthesis diffusion model that exploits a transformer-based backbone architecture to predict a radiance field from a single reference image." (Introduction)
- "Wehaveintroduced DT-NVS,atransformer-based 3D-aware diffusion model trained on real-world multiview images." (Conclusion)
