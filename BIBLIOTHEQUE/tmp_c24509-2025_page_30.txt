                  9.8 SingleFrameOccupancyConditionalGeneration
                  We present the results of generating frames based on a single-frame occupancy condition in Fig. 18. The
                  results demonstrate good temporal consistency with the condition frame, highlighting our model’s ability to
                  condition on easily accessible data.
