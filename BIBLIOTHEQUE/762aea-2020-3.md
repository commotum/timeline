# Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks (2021)
Source: 762aea-2020.pdf

## Core reasons
- Treats retrieved documents as latent variables and marginalizes over them during generation, changing the computation process.
- Introduces an explicit non-parametric memory (document index) that the model accesses for knowledge.

## Evidence extracts
- "treat z as a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents." (p. 2)
- "We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory." (p. 3)
