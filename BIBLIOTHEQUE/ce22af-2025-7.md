# 4DSegStreamer: Streaming 4D Panoptic Segmentation via Dual Threads (2025)
Source: ce22af-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper presents 4DSegStreamer as a framework for streaming 4D panoptic segmentation, centered on a dual-thread system.
- The contribution focuses on real-time streaming segmentation capabilities integrated with existing 3D/4D segmentation methods.

## Evidence extracts
- "4DSegStreamer: Streaming 4D Panoptic Segmentation via Dual Threads" (p. 1)
- "4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-
Thread System to efficiently process streaming frames. The
framework is general and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable real-
time capability." (p. 1)
