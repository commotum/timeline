# Natural Actor-Critic (2008)
Source: 27b6d6-2008.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a novel reinforcement learning architecture (Natural Actor-Critic) focused on actor-critic policy-gradient updates.
- Centers on optimization/training methodology via natural policy gradients and critic estimation rather than datasets or positional encoding.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, we suggest a novel reinforcement learning architecture, the Natural Actor-Critic." (p. 1)
- "The actor updates are achieved using
  stochastic policy gradients employing Amari’s natural gradient approach, while the critic obtains both the natural policy gradient and
  additional parameters of a value function simultaneously by linear regression." (p. 1)
