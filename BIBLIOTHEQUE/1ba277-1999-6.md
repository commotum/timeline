# Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects (1999)
Source: 1ba277-1999.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is a neuroscience study modeling visual cortex feedback/feedforward signaling and receptive-field effects rather than proposing ML architecture changes.
- The contribution is explanatory context for neural coding (predictive coding) in brain circuits, fitting cross-disciplinary foundations rather than ML methods or datasets.

## Evidence extracts
- "We describe a model of visual processing in which feedback connections from a higher- to a lower-order visual cortical area carry predictions of lower-level neural activities, whereas the feedforward connections carry the residual errors between the predictions and the actual lower-level activities." (Abstract)
- "When exposed to natural images, a hierarchical network of model neurons implementing such a model developed simple-cell-like receptive fields." (Abstract)
