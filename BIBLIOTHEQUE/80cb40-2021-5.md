# Per-Pixel Classification is Not All You Need for Semantic Segmentation (2021)
Source: 80cb40-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes MaskFormer, a mask classification model for semantic segmentation that is a new modeling approach rather than a dataset/benchmark.
- Frames the contribution as a unified model/loss/training pipeline for semantic and instance-level segmentation, indicating a methodological ML contribution.

## Evidence extracts
- "We show that a simple mask classiﬁcation model can outperform state-of-the-art per-pixel classiﬁcation models," (p. 10)
- "MaskFormer, for the ﬁrst time, uniﬁes semantic- and instance-level segmentation with the exact same model, loss, and training pipeline." (p. 8)
