# Two action systems in the human brain (2012)
Source: 1b9229-1999.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is a neuroscience review describing distinct dorsal routes in the human brain for action (“Grasp” and “Use” systems), not a machine learning method.
- It focuses on how parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes process object information for action, grounding the work in brain anatomy and cognition.

## Evidence extracts
- "A growing body of evidence, instead, suggests that there are at least two distinct Dorsal routes in the human brain, referred to as the “Grasp” and “Use” systems." (Abstract)
- "Two parallel streams in the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes process distinct aspects of object information relevant for action." (9. Conclusion)
