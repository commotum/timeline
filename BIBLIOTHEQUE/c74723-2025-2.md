# PanSt3R:Multi-viewConsistent Panoptic Segmentation (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: c74723-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper centers on 3D panoptic segmentation and 3D scene understanding, positioning the contribution in a higher-dimensional (3D) domain.
- The method relies on transformer-based components for its modeling pipeline.

## Evidence extracts
- "Panoptic segmentation in 3D is a fundamental problem in scene understanding." (p. 1)
- "DINOv2, MUSt3R is a Transformer-based network, but it" (p. 3)

## Classification
Class name: Increasing Transformer's Dimensions
Class code: 2
