                               Wait, let me verify that again ...
                               Wait,        but that seems straightforward,
                               but let me check if I got the constants right
                               ...
                               Wait, but let me verify this to ensure
                               I didn’t make a mistake ...
                               Wait, so is the answer 756?                             But let
                               mecheckifthis is consistent ...
                               Wait,        but in 3D space, the centers
                               might not be coplanar? ...
                               Alternatively, try to find a general formula ...
                               Alternatively, consider that m is such
                               that m divides k where k is from 1 to 999 ...
                               Alternatively, maybe we can use mod-
                               ulo 8 to get constraints ...
                               Alternatively, perhaps there’s a smarter
                               approach ...
                               Alternatively,             another         way to think
                               about this problem is to recognize that w
                               and z are roots of unity ...
