            9.4 Command-&Trajectory-GuidedGeneration
            Wepresent command conditional generation in Fig. 13 and trajectory conditional generation in Fig. 14. These
            results show that when we input a command, such as "right turn," or a sequence of XY-plane coordinates,
            our model can effectively control the motion of the ego vehicle and the relative motion of the entire scene
            based on these movement trends.

            Figure13 Command-GuidedSceneGenerationResults. We provide qualitative examples of a total of 16 consectutive
            frames generated under the command RIGHT by DynamicCity on CarlaSC [42]. Best viewed in colors and zoomed-in
            for additional details.
