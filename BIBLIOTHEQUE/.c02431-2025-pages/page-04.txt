                   various mechanisms, including using neural networks to ground symbols in perception, employing symbolic modules
                   to guide neural learning, or developing hybrid representations that blend continuous and discrete elements [5]. Recent
                   work in this area has explored differentiable reasoning modules, neural theorem provers, and systems that can learn
                   symbolic programs from examples. The neurosymbolic approach has shown particular promise in domains requiring
                   both perception and reasoning, such as visual question answering, robotic planning, and scientific discovery, where
                   pure neural or pure symbolic approaches struggle to achieve human-level performance [3].

                   CoreThink introduces a novel approach to symbolic reasoning by constructing complex behaviors from a minimal set
                   of fundamental operations. This method emphasizes that intelligence can emerge from a few core primitives system-
                   atically combined. Unlike traditional neural models, CoreThink maintains explicit representations of its reasoning
                   processes, offering transparency and ease of debugging. The system excels in tasks requiring hierarchical problem de-
                   composition, analogical solution transfer across domains, and incremental refinement of symbolic structures through
                   interaction. By preserving detailed traces of its reasoning, CoreThink facilitates introspection and explanation gener-
                   ation, addressing the limitations inherent in black-box machine learning models. This approach aligns with cognitive
                   science theories suggesting that human intelligence relies on a small set of flexible cognitive primitives. CoreThink
                   has demonstrated effectiveness in tasks necessitating systematic generalization and compositional reasoning, areas
                   where end-to-end neural models often fall short.[13]
