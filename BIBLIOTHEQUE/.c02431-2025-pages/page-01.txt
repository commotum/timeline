                  This paper investigates the potential of compositional reasoning approaches toward achieving Artificial General
                Intelligence (AGI) over purely test-time scaled solutions, using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) as a
                testbed for evaluation.
                  Weposit that neither purely connectionist neural architectures nor strictly symbolic reasoning systems are suffi-
                cient to meet the requirements of ARC-AGI-2. Instead, a neuro-symbolic framework integrating subsymbolic per-
                ception with explicit reasoning provides a more comprehensive computational model.
                  In this work, we demonstrate how our neuro-symbolic reasoning framework augments existing large language
                models (LLMs) to tackle ARC-AGI-2 tasks far more effectively. Our system outperforms comparable baselines,
                achieving a score of 24.4%, a relative improvement of approximately +50% over Grok-4 on the ARC-AGI-2 public
                evaluation set. Furthermore, by ensembling our approach with the ARC Lang Solver approach (26.6%) via a meta-
                classifier, we reached a final state-of-the-art score of 30.8%. This reasoning layer not only boosts generalization on
                ARCtasks, solving a broader range of unseen tasks, but also improves interpretability, as each transformation is per-
                ceived and represented symbolically. We further identify key challenges encountered during our research and outline
                promisingdirections where neuro-symbolic reasoning can further advance ARC. Collectively, these innovations chart
                a compelling path forward for advancing neuro-symbolic AGI in ARC and beyond.
            1   Introduction
            Since its release in 2019, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) has emerged as a premier benchmark for
            evaluating fluid intelligence—the human-like ability to infer abstract rules from a handful of examples and apply them
            in novel situations. The first iteration, ARC-AGI-1, challenged AI systems to generalize beyond pattern recognition,
            demanding symbolic abstraction from minimal examples. While early large language models like GPT-3 performed
            near 0%, and GPT-4 hovered between 5–21%, the field saw a breakthrough when OpenAI’s o3[11] reached nearly
            88%onARC-AGI-1underhigh-computesettings—aremarkableleapfrompreviousbaselines.
               Despite this progress, ARC-AGI-1 exhibited vulnerabilities: some tasks were solvable via brute-force search or
            memorization of visual templates. To address these weaknesses, the ARC Prize released ARC-AGI-2 in March 2025.
            This revamped benchmark maintains the same input–output grid format and core-knowledge constraints but intro-
            duces hundreds of novel, harder puzzles explicitly curated to require multi-step compositional reasoning, context-
            sensitive rule application, and rich symbolic interpretation. Extensive human testing confirmed that every task re-
            mains solvable by at least two people in two attempts or less, with humans achieving near 100% accuracy, while AI
            systems—including high-compute o3—struggle to reach even double-digit success rates on ARC-AGI-2.
               In essence, ARC-AGI-2 refines the evaluation methodology to reduce reliance on brute-force, increases task com-
            plexity, and places stricter demands on generalization and abstraction. The result is a benchmark that remains acces-
            sible to humans but continues to expose the gaps in AI reasoning architectures—a critical challenge for any system
            claiming progress toward AGI.
