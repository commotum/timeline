                 APreprint.
                 Only return a JSON object in this exact format:
                 {"background_color": <integer from 0 to 9 or -1>}
                 Do not explain your reasoning before the JSON. Only output the JSON on
                 the first line.
                 Here is the grid:
                 {grid_str}
                 B.4.2   Object Shape Analysis Prompt
                 This prompt is used by the ‘BaseObject.-analyze-shape‘ method to generate a natural language description of an
                 object’s shape, which can be used in downstream reasoning.
                 You are given a rectangular 2D grid of shape {grid_shape}.
                 Each pixel is represented by an integer between 0 and 9, where 0 means black
                 (background), and other values are colors. The pixels in colors represent
                 an object
                 Here is the full grid:
                 {grid_str}
                 The object is defined by the following coordinates:
                 {coord_str}
                 Your task is to analyse the shape of this object, remember that the object
                 can also be irregular and have cavities inside it.
                 Describe the shape of this object in a single statement, try to include as
                 much detail as possible
                 B.4.3   Cavity Detection Prompt
                 This prompt is used by the ‘BaseObject.get-cavities‘ method. It uses the shape analysis (if available) to identify and
                 extract the coordinates of any enclosed cavities (holes) within an object.
                 You are given a rectangular 2D grid of shape {grid_shape}.
                 Each pixel is represented by an integer between 0 and 9, where 0 means black
                 (background), and other values are colors. The pixels in colors represent
                 an object
                 Here is the full grid:
                 {grid_str}
                 The object is defined by the following coordinates:
                 {coord_str}
                 Here is the analysis of the shape of the object: {shape_analysis}
                 Your task is to find out the cavities inside this object and return the
                 coordinates that constitute the object.
                 Return the output in this format:
                 Cavity 1 : <List of coordinates of Cavity 1>
                 Cavity 2 : <List of coordinates of Cavity 2 >
                 .....................
                 Cavity n : <List of coordinates of Cavity n>
                 where ’n’ is the number of cavities you detected. Return the coordinates
                 only, don’t give any explanation.
