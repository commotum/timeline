                    • Fluid abstraction: interpretable transformation from raw grids to symbolic constructs.
                    • Compositional generalization: combining multiple reasoning steps and context-dependent rules.
                    • Robust test-time adaptation: across novel, noisy tasks.

                      merating discrete hypotheses. This allows coherent reasoning across disjoint object groups and conditional
                      contexts within a single task instance.

               TheAbstractionandReasoningCorpusforArtificialGeneralIntelligence(ARC-AGI-1)wasintroducedbyChollet[1]
               as a benchmark designed to measure an AI system’s ability to efficiently acquire new skills and solve novel problems.
               Unlike traditional benchmarks that test memorization or pattern matching on large datasets, ARC-AGI-1 presents a
               collection of visual reasoning tasks that require few-shot learning and abstraction capabilities. Each task consists of a
               smallnumberofinput-outputgridexamples,wherethesystemmustinfertheunderlyingtransformationruleandapply
               it to new test inputs. The benchmark explicitly targets core knowledge priors such as objectness, goal-directedness,
               and basic physics and geometry, making it particularly challenging for current deep learning approaches that rely
               heavily on extensive training data. The relatively poor performance of state-of-the-art neural networks on ARC-AGI-1
               has highlighted fundamental limitations in achieving human-like fluid intelligence and has motivated research into
               moresample-efficient and generalizable AI architectures.

               work for abstract reasoning capabilities [8]. ARC-AGI-2 introduces additional complexity dimensions and addresses
               some limitations identified in the original benchmark, including expanded task diversity, more nuanced difficulty
               gradations, and improved evaluation protocols. The updated benchmark places greater emphasis on compositional
               reasoning, hierarchical abstraction, and the ability to combine multiple primitive operations in novel ways. ARC-AGI-
