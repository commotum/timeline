             B.1  Solver Prompt Template
             This prompt is used to guide the model in performing step-by-step reasoning and transformation inference based on
             provided Input–Output grid examples and structured hints.
             Example {i}:
             Input:
             {input_viz}
             Output:
             {output_viz}

             {examples}
             Based on the pattern in the examples, what would the output for the following

             You are given a set of Input{Output Examples and a detailed list of
             Transformation Steps (the Hint).
             ## Your Task
             1. Examine the examples to understand exactly how the transformations
             are applied.
             2. Follow the hint steps in order, exactly as described, with
             no additions or omissions.
             3. Use the examples to resolve any remaining ambiguities in the hint.
             4. Apply the same sequence of transformations to the Test Input.
