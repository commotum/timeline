             ## Output Instructions
             1. Present your full reasoning, detailing how each step from the hint maps
             to the transformation operations you perform.
             2. Do not invent any new rules or skip any hint steps. Ensure the Test Output
             reflects the same behavior demonstrated by the examples.
             3. Embed the Final output in ‘‘‘ ‘‘‘ and use \n for new row and | as column
             separator.
             4. I want you to solve this puzzle step by step. First, restate the problem.
             Then outline your plan. Then execute each step, numbering them, and finally give
             your answer.
             Test Output:
             B.2  Pattern Detection Prompt
             This prompt is designed for object-level pattern recognition, enabling the model to analyze Input and Output grids and
             return structured JSON detections for each candidate pattern.
             Coordinate System:
              Top-left cell is (0, 0). x increases down (rows), y increases right (columns).
             Given:
              Input Grid:
             ‘{}‘
              Output Grid:
             ‘{}‘
              Input Objects: ‘{}‘
              Output Objects: ‘{}‘
              Pattern Specifications: ‘{}‘
             Task: For each pattern in the given list:
             1. Compare Input vs Output objects to identify moves, removals, additions,
             rotations, shifts, duplications, or color changes.
             2. Do note that some objects might combine to form a multi color bigger object.
             3. Decide if the pattern applies.
             4. Provide a concise reason for your decision even if ‘pattern_detected‘
             is ‘false‘. Include the precise reasons for object movements, additions, removals,
             retention. There exist some logic, your task is to find it using the help of patterns
             and params.
             5. List only the matched parameter values under ‘params‘ (use an empty object if none).
             Output: Return only this JSON array (no extra text):
             ‘‘‘json
             [
               {
                 "reason": "<detailed explanation>",
                 "pattern_detected": <true|false>,
                 "pattern_name": "<Pattern Name>",
                 "pattern_description": "<Pattern Specification.description>",
                 "params": { / matched values or {} / }
