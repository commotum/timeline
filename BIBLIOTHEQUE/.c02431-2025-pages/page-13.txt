             * object filled: ["irregular","triangle","rectangle","square"]
        • Diagonal Fill
          – Description: Propagate color or object along a diagonal axis.
          – Parameters:
             * source point or corner: ["L-shaped","rectangle"]
             * direction: ["bottom-right","top-left","top-right","bottom-left"]
             * fill color: ["same as source","complementary to source","change on bounce"]
             * stop condition: ["object obstruction","hit grid boundary"]
        • Pattern Matching Fill / Remove
          – Description: Identify a repeating subpattern and either color it in or erase it.
          – Parameters:
             * template pattern: ["alternate objects", "similar objects", "symmetry via
              some axis"]
             * operation: ["remove cells to match pattern","fill cells to match pattern"]
             * fill color: ["boundary color","pattern color"]
             * tolerance: ["no tolerance","edges are exceptions"]
             * target regions: ["inside a cavity","outside an object"]
        • Creating Patterns based on starting Objects
          – Description: Generate a larger or repeated pattern seeded from one or more “starter” objects.
          – Parameters:
             * seed objects: ["colored cell","rectangle","diagonal"]
             * transformation sequence: ["circular", "straight", "fill all", "towards an
              object"]
             * inter object spacing: ["none","single","multiple","variable"]
             * repeat: ["till filling the cavity","only once"]
             * stopping condition:["reached an object","reached boundary","filled object
              completely"]
        • Find Objects in the Input Image and Color Them
          – Description: Detects all instances of a certain object class and applies a new color.
          – Parameters:
             * object type: ["plus","rectangle","irregular","circle","cell","horizontal
              bar"]
             * new color: ["complements the original color","constant throughout","alternating
              pattern"]
             * detection method: ["exact match","fuzzy","at some location"]
             * overlap policy: ["all unique","overlaps allowed"]
        • Remove Objects from the Output in a Particular Sequence
          – Description: Systematically delete objects one at a time in a defined order.
          – Parameters:
             * object list ordered: ["all in the row","all in a column","same shape"]
             * removal method: ["erase and color","replace with background"]
