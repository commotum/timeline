                          • Full Model (Meta-Classifier): A Grok 4 model trained to select the best two solutions from the combined
                            pool of four candidates (two from each solver), scoring 30.8% in the latest run.
                       This ensemble strategy is designed to leverage the different strengths of each solver. The Meta-Classifier is trained
                   with examples to demonstrate the characteristics of a correct solution. A key constraint for the classifier’s output is
                   that the return format must be enclosed in double asterisks (   ... )toallowforeasylocationandextraction.

                   SymbolicHints: Themostsignificant performance drop occurs when the symbolic hints are removed. The score falls
                   from24.4%to17.5%(a7.0percentagepointdecrease),evenwhentherobustself-consistency mechanismis retained.
                   This degradation highlights that the LLM, when relying solely on its own internal reasoning over the raw pixel grids,
                   struggles to identify the correct underlying transformations. The explicit symbolic constraints provided by our pipeline
                   are therefore crucial for guiding the LLM toward the correct solution space and are the primary driver of our system’s
                   performance.
                       Self-Consistency: Removing the self-consistency voting mechanism also results in a notable performance de-
                   crease, with the score dropping from 24.4% to 20.5% (a 4.0 percentage point decrease). This finding indicates that
                   even when provided with strong symbolic hints, the generative process of the LLM remains stochastic. A single,
                   greedy-decoded output may contain errors or fail to perfectly adhere to the provided constraints. The pixel-wise ma-
                   jority voting acts as a vital stabilization layer, filtering out noise and averaging over minor generative errors to produce
                   a more reliable and accurate final grid.

                   cost drivers are the symbolic pipeline and the self-consistency mechanism.
                       SymbolicHintsCost(T          , C    ): This represents a fixed, upfront computational cost for each task. It includes

                   the deterministic object detection (BFS, etc.) and the inference calls to o4-mini to detect the 22 atomic patterns.
                   While not negligible, this cost is additive and significantly smaller than the cost of the main LLM.
                       Self-Consistency Cost (N ×T        , N ×C      ): This is the dominant factor in both latency and cost. By sampling

                   N times from Grok-4, we multiply the most expensive part of our pipeline. This makes any configuration with self-
                   consistency (the Full Model and the ”w/o Symbolic Hints” model) an order of magnitude slower and more expensive
                   than configurations using a single greedy decode.
                       Collectively, these ablations underscore that our system’s state-of-the-art performance is a result of this high-cost,
                   high-accuracy configuration. However, the w/o Self-Consistency model (Grok-4 + Hints) presents a highly efficient
                   alternative. It achieves a score of 20.5%—a 5.5 percentage point improvement over the baseline—while incurring
                   only a modest, additive computational cost from the symbolic pipeline. This configuration represents an excellent
                   trade-off, securing the majority of the reasoning gains from our symbolic hints without the multiplicative expense of
                   self-consistency.
