        • Scattering Pattern
          – Description: Project a scatter-like pattern which is triangular in shape with staircase-like edges, and fills all
           the cells in its path.
          – Parameters:
             * source: ["starting cell","object"]
             * direction: ["horizontal","vertical","diagonal","radially outwards"]
             * shape: ["triangle"]
             * stop condition: ["object","boundary"]
             * mark color: ["same as starting point", "alternating pattern", "change on
              hit","based on other objects"]
             * boundary: ["single cell thickness of different color than the pattern",
              "multi cell thickness of different color than the pattern"]
             * edge pattern: ["staircase with a width ’w’ and height ’h’, where ’w’ and
              ’h’ are number of cells"]
        • Patterns formed using small objects
          – Description: Spatial patterns and color scheme formed by smaller objects.
          – Parameters:
             * small object type: ["small adjacent objects","parts of a bigger object"]
             * small pattern type: ["spatial pattern and/or color scheme pattern formed
              by smaller distinct objects","coloring scheme pattern formed inside a
              object"]
