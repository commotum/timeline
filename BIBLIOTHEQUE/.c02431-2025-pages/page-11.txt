                   7     Conclusion
                   The ARC benchmark continues to reveal the limitations of purely neural or symbolic systems. Neuro-symbolic AI,
                   combining perception and logical reasoning, offers a promising avenue toward AGI-level abstraction and composi-
                   tional generalization. Our results on ARC-AGI-2 show that structured hybrid architectures can significantly advance
                   the state of reasoning systems, pointing toward more interpretable and adaptable forms of general intelligence.
