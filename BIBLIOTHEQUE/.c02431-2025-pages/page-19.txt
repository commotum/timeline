                 B.3    Meta-Classifier Prompt
                 This prompt is used by the final ensemble model (Section 2). It instructs Grok-4 to analyze the training task, the test
                 task, and a list of 4 candidate solutions (2 from the Compositional Reasoner, 2 from the ARC Lang Solver) and select
                 the single most likely solution. The pass@2 score is achieved by running this classifier twice.
                 """You are given a some input-output examples, and a test task. You are also
                 given a list of possible solutions.
                 Your job is to figure out the pattern in the input-output examples
                 and select the most likely solution from the list
                 of possible solutions. Output only the solution ID.

                 B.4    Object Detection Prompts
                 These prompts are used in the initial object detection and feature extraction stages (Stage 1) to build a symbolic
                 representation of the grid. They are called by the ‘Grid‘ and ‘BaseObject‘ classes defined in our system to perform
                 fine-grained feature analysis.
                 B.4.1   BackgroundColorDetectionPrompt
                 This prompt is used by the ‘Grid.find-background‘ method to identify the most likely background color, which is
                 essential for segmenting foreground objects.
                 You are given a 2D grid of integers ranging from 0 to 9.
                 Each integer represents a color. The goal is to determine the most likely
                 background color in the grid.
                 The background color is typically:
                 - The color that appears most frequently overall in the grid.
                 - The color that touches the edges of the grid (top, bottom, left, or right).
                 - The color that is not part of compact or enclosed clusters (i.e., likely
                    not part of foreground objects).
                 Use the following decision strategy:
                 1. Start by identifying the most frequent color in the grid.
                 2. If that color also touches one or more edges of the grid, assume it is
                     the background.
                 3. If multiple colors meet these criteria or the result is ambiguous, return -1.
