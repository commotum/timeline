        A AtomicTransformationLibrary(UnitPatterns)
        Our symbolic reasoning engine is built upon a curated library of 22 atomic transformations, or ”Unit Patterns,” that
        serveastheDomain-SpecificLanguage(DSL)forARC.Thesepatterns(visualizedinFigure2)wereidentifiedthrough
        manual analysis of the ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2 training sets. They are designed to be a ”core knowledge” set,
        covering the vast majority of primitive and compositional operations seen in the corpus.
         Unlike simple primitives (e.g., Rotate90), these Unit Patterns are more complex, parameterized operations that
        describe a common reasoning process found in ARC tasks. They are the target operations our o4-mini hypothesis
        generator (Stage 2) attempts to detect.
         The22patterns are as follows:
        • Horizontal Fill
          – Description: Extend or fill an object horizontally across contiguous empty or target cells.
          – Parameters:
             * source object: ["line","square","rectangle","cavity"]
             * column index: ["left of an object","right of an object"]
             * fill color: ["based on source","based on some different objects"]
             * sequence: ["based on source width","based on source height"]
             * stop condition: ["another object","grid boundary","specific color"]
             * overlaps: ["keep the latest","no overlaps possible"]
        • Vertical Fill
          – Description: Extend or fill an object vertically across contiguous empty or target cells.
          – Parameters:
             * source object: ["line","square","rectangle","cavity"]
             * row index: ["top of an object","below an object"]
             * fill color: ["based on source color"]
             * sequence: ["based on source width","based on source height"]
             * stop condition: ["another object","grid boundary","specific color"]
        • Connecting Bridges
          – Description: Draw a “bridge” (line/shape) between two objects in a specified color order.
          – Parameters:
             * source object: ["line","square","rectangle","cavity"]
             * target object: ["line","square","rectangle","cavity"]
             * bridge color: ["based on bridge starting point","based on bridge ending
              point","based on cavity inside an object"]
             * connection shape: ["line","triangle","rectangle","circle"]
             * path direction: ["orthogonal","diagonal","based on color sequence"]
             * thickness: ["based on width of cavity","based on width of starting object"]
        • Boundary Attachment Fill
          – Description: Close holes or voids inside an object’s boundary bounding area.
          – Parameters:
             * objects with holes: ["horizontally laid", "vertically laid", "diagonally
              laid"]
             * attachment direction: ["left","right","top","bottom"]
             * fill logic: ["fits in space to form rectangle","gets laid on the object"]
