# End-to-End Differentiable Proving (2017)
Source: 4e63d1-2017.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces Neural Theorem Provers as end-to-end differentiable provers for KB queries, shifting reasoning into differentiable computation.
- Uses Prolog-style backward chaining to recursively construct neural networks for proving queries, emphasizing a computation mechanism for multi-hop reasoning.

## Evidence extracts
- "Weintroduce neural networks for end-to-end differentiable proving of queries to knowledge bases by operating on dense vector representations of symbols." (p. 1)
- "Concretely, we introduce Neural Theorem Provers (NTPs): End-to-end differentiable provers for basic theorems formulated as queries to a KB. We use Prolog’s backward chaining algorithm as a recipe for recursively constructing neural networks that are capable of proving queries to a KB using subsymbolic representations." (p. 2)
