# Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (2015)
Source: 3ba397-2015.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces residual learning blocks where outputs are defined as y=F(x,{W})+x, indicating an architectural framework for deep networks.
- Applies residual learning throughout the model design, framing it as a general optimization principle for deep CNNs.

## Evidence extracts
- "Weadopt residual learning to every few stacked layers." (p. 3)
- "y=F(x,{W})+x." (p. 3)

## Classification
