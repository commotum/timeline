# MT-Bench-101: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Multi-Turn Dialogues (2024)
Source: a7dd1e-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces MT-Bench-101 as a benchmark to evaluate fine-grained multi-turn dialogue abilities of LLMs.
- Provides a structured multi-turn dialogue taxonomy and dataset statistics (tasks/dialogues/turns), emphasizing evaluation infrastructure.

## Evidence extracts
- "address this issue, we introduce MT-Bench-
  101, specifically designed to evaluate the fine-
  grained abilities of LLMs in multi-turn dia-
  logues. By conducting a detailed analysis of" (p. 1)
- "Table 2 shows the key statistics of our MT-Bench-
  101. This benchmark features a comprehensive hi-
  erarchical taxonomy for multi-turn dialogues with
  13 distinct tasks, 1388 dialogues, and 4208 turns." (p. 4)
