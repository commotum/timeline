                     Question: A solid copper bar of circular cross section has length Ì†µ„åµ	 = 	1.25	Ì†µ„åµand shear modulus of elasticity
                     Ì†µ„åµ	 = 	45	GPa. The bar is designed to carry a 250	Ì†µ„åµ 0 Ì†µ„åµ	torque acting at the ends. If the allowable shear stress is
                     30	Ì†µ„åµÌ†µ„åµÌ†µ„åµ and the allowable angle of twist between the ends is 2.5¬∞, what is the minimum required diameter?
                     Original Options:
                     (A) 35.7 mm    (B) 45.7 mm (C)55.7 mm
                     AugmentedOptions:
                     (D) 25.7 mm (E) 40.7 mm (F) 50.7mm      (G) 30.7mm
                     (H)20.7mm (I)60.7 mm
                     GPT-4o (w/o augment options): To determine the minimum required diameter of the solid copper bar, we
                     need to check two conditions: 1. The maximum shear stress condition. 2. The allowable angle of twist
                     condition. Step 1: Maximum Shear Stress Condition. The torsional shear stress for a solid circular shaft is

                     given by: œÑ =	T	‚ãÖr Ì†µ„åµ, where œÑ is the shear stress, T is the applied torque, r	 is the radius of the shaft, Ì†µ„åµ is the
                                                                                             !‚ÅÑ

                     conditions are met. Therefore, the minimum required diameter is given by: Answer: A
                     GPT-4o (w/ augment options): To determine the minimum required diameter of the solid copper bar, we
                     needtoconsiderboth the maximumallowableshear stress and the maximum allowable angle of twist. Step 1:
                     Maximum Allowable Shear Stress. The relationship between the torque T, the shear stress œÑ, and the polar
                     moment of inertia Ì†µ„åµ for a circular cross-section is given by... Therefore, the minimum required diameter is:
                     d	 ‚âà 55.68	mm. The closest value greater than or equal to 55.68 mm from the options provided is: Answer: C
