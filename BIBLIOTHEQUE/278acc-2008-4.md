# Machine Super Intelligence (2008)
Source: 278acc-2008.pdf

## Core reasons
- The thesis explicitly centers a "universal intelligence measure" as a core contribution, indicating a measurement framework for machine intelligence.
- It formalizes intelligence as a measurable ability across environments, focusing on how to define and assess intelligence rather than proposing a new model architecture.

## Evidence extracts
- "The speciﬁc formulation of the universal intelligence measure is of my own creation." (Preface, Thesis outline)
- "Intelligence measures an agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments." (Section 4.1. A formal deﬁnition of machine intelligence)
