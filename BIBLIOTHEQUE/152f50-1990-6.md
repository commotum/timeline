# Cellular and circuit basis of working memory in prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates (1990)
Source: 152f50-1990.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper centers on biological working memory mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates, indicating a neuroscience focus rather than an ML method.
- It presents cellular and circuit-level discussion of brain function, serving as cross-disciplinary context for ML rather than a modeling contribution.
