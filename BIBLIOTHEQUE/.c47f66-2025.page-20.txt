                             E ExperimentalSetupofVisionEncoderImpact
                             Toevaluate the influence of vision encoders on model performance, we conduct experiments using the
                             open-source architecture Cambrian-1. These experiments fix both the training data (Cambrian-1 1M SFT
                             data) and the large language model (Llama 3.1 8B) to isolate the impact of different vision encoders.
                             Inspired by Cambrian-1: A Fully Open, Vision-Centric Exploration of Multimodal LLMs (Tong et al.,
                             2024a), we follow their methodology by interpolating visual features to a fixed number of tokens (576)
                             and concatenating them along the feature dimension.

                                 GPT-4o (Vision Setting): The multiple-choice question in the image is: No. 6: Image 1 - Which of the following reflects a main point of
                                 the cartoon? Options: (A) The United States' acquisition of overseas colonies is part of the natural progression for the country and will
                                 gain the approval of foreign powers. (B) The United States' acquisition of overseas territories is a response to the imperialist actions of
                                 other countries. (C) The United States' acquisition of overseas territories is dangerous and could lead to war with other imperialist
                                 powers. (D) The United States' acquisition of overseas territories is necessary to bring civilization to the natives of the newly acquired
                                 territories. (E) The United States' acquisition of overseas colonies represents a break from the democratic traditions that had guided
                                 America since its founding. (F) The United States' acquisition of overseas territories will lead to economic prosperity for the country. (G)
                                 The United States' acquisition of overseas colonies is a reflection of the country's greed and imperialism. (H) The United States'
                                 acquisition of overseas colonies is a violation of human rights and international law. (I) The United States' acquisition of overseas
                                 territories is a sign of the country's declining power. (J) The United States' acquisition of overseas territories is a necessary step in
                                 maintainingits global dominance.
                                 To determine the main point of the cartoon, we need to analyze the visual content and any text present in the cartoon. The cartoon
                                 appears to depict a negative view of U.S. expansionism, comparing the U.S. to European imperial powers who are often associated with
                                 greed and exploitation. Therefore, the main point likely reflects a critical stance on the U.S.'s actions. Answer: (G)
                                 Analysis: In the vision-only input scenario, the model accurately extracts text from the photo. However, its response tends to be more
                                 basic and lacks in-depth analysis. The integration of both visual and textual information appears to increase the cognitive load on the
                                 vision module, which mayresult in a higher likelihood of errors.
