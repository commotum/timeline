# Are NLP Models really able to Solve Simple Math Word Problems? (2021)
Source: 833153-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces SVAMP as a newly created challenge dataset of simple arithmetic math word problems (grade level up to 4).
- The dataset is explicitly designed to test and measure model capabilities across different aspects of solving word problems, emphasizing evaluation/benchmarking.

## Evidence extracts
- "To this end, we
create a challenge set named SVAMP containing
simple one-unknown arithmetic word problems of
grade level up to 4." (p. 5)
- "The examples in SVAMP test
a model across different aspects of solving word
problems." (p. 5)
