                 BOX 1 PROPERTIES OF THE OPTIMAL COST-TO-GO FUNCTION. 
                 Consider the task (a) of making a
                 pendulum swing up as quickly as possible.
                 The pendulum is driven by a torque motor
                 with limited output, and has to overcome
                 gravity. Because this is a second-order
                 system, the state vector includes the
                 pendulum angle and angular velocity. The
                 cost function penalizes the vertical
                 distance away from the upright position 
                 (b) as well as the squared torque output. If
           osciencewe attempt to minimize this cost greedily,
                 by always pushing up, the pendulum will never rise above some intermediate position where gravity balances the maximal torque the motor
                 can generate. The only way to overcome gravity is to swing in one direction, and then accelerate in the opposite direction. This is similar to
                 hitting and throwing tasks, where we have to move our arm back before accelerating it forward. The important point here is that the cost
                 function itself does not directly suggest such a strategy. Indeed, the relationship between costs and optimal controls is rather subtle, and is
           .com/natureneurmediated by another function: the ‘optimal cost-to-go’. For each state, this function tells us how much cost we will accumulate from now
                 until the end of the movement, assuming we choose controls optimally. The optimal cost-to-go obeys a self-consistency condition known as
                 Bellman’s optimality principle: the optimal cost-to-go at each state (c) is found by considering every possible control at that state, adding the
           .naturecontrol cost to the optimal cost-to-go for the resulting next state, and taking the minimum of these sums. The latter minimization also yields
                 the optimal control law; in (d) the color corresponds to the optimal torque as a function of the pendulum state (black, maximum negative;
                 white, maximum positive). Plot (c) shows two optimal trajectories starting at different states. One uses the strategy of swinging back and then
                 forward; the other goes straight to the goal because the initial velocity is sufficient to overcome gravity.
           http://wwwNote that both trajectories in (c) are moving roughly downhill along the optimal cost-to-go surface (from light to dark). This is
            
                 because, for a large class of problems, the vector of optimal control signals can be computed by taking the negative gradient of the
           oup                                                                                                                 30,91
           Gr    optimal cost-to-go function, and multiplying it by a matrix that reflects plant dynamics and energy costs          . This gradient, known in
                 control theory as the ‘costate vector’, is a vector with the same dimensionality as the state; it tells us how to change the state so as to
                 increase the cost-to-go most rapidly. Now imagine that the costate vector is encoded by some population of neurons—which would not
           lishing be surprising given its fundamental role in the computation of optimal controls. Because optimal controls are obtained from the costate
                                                                                                                                                    119
                 via matrix multiplication, the activities of these neurons can directly drive muscle activation. This is reminiscent of a model        of direct
           Pub   cortical control of muscle activation, and suggests that the costate vector is something that might be encoded in the output of primary
                 motor cortex. What does the costate look like? As explained above, it is related to how the state varies under the action of the optimal
                 controller; if the state includes position and velocity, the costate might resemble a mix of velocity and acceleration. But this
           Nature relationship is loose; the only general way to find the true costate is to solve the optimal control problem.
