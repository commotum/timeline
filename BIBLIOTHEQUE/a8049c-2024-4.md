# MVBench: A Comprehensive Multi-modal Video Understanding Benchmark (Not specified in the paper.)
Source: a8049c-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces MVBench as a comprehensive multi-modal video understanding benchmark covering 20 temporal video tasks, which is a benchmark resource for evaluation.
- Uses public video datasets to build task examples and evaluation material, emphasizing measurement infrastructure over a new model.

## Evidence extracts
- "To alleviate this issue, we introduce a comprehensive Multi-modal Video understand- ing Benchmark, namely MVBench, which covers 20 chal- lenging video tasks that cannot be effectively solved with a single frame." (Abstract)
- "Table 1. Task examples of MVBench. The videos are collected from the public datasets, including STAR [77], PAXION [74], Moments in Time V1[52], FunQA[80],CLEVRER[88],PerceptionTest[56],Charades-STA[19],MoVQA[95],NTURGB+D[45],VLN-CE[30] and TVQA [33]." (Table 1)
