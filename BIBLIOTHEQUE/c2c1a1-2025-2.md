# Graph Perceiver IO: A General Architecture for Graph-Structured Data (2025)
Source: c2c1a1-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces Graph Perceiver IO as an adaptation of Perceiver IO specifically for graph-structured data, extending an attention-based architecture to graphs.
- Defines graph-specific input and output array construction for training on graphs, enabling graph tasks by using node features and adjacency information.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this study, we provide a Graph Perceiver IO (GPIO), the Perceiver IO for the graph structured dataset." (p. 4)
- "In order to train graphs using Perceiver IO, the input array and the output query array should be constructed by using X and A properly." (p. 13)
