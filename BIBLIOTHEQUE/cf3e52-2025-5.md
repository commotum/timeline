# Test-time Adaptation of Tiny Recursive Models (2025)
Source: cf3e52-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper's contribution centers on adapting a pre-trained tiny recursive model via efficient fine-tuning under compute limits for ARC tasks.
- It emphasizes full fine-tuning as the effective adaptation strategy for the tiny recursive transformer model.

## Evidence extracts
- "This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model that has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on competition tasks within the allowed compute limits." (Abstract)
- "This paper demonstrates that starting from a pre-trained tiny recursive model significantly accelerates training on new, unseen tasks." (Section 1.4 ApproachandContribution)
