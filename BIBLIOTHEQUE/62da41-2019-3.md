# PonderNet: Learning to Ponder (2021)
Source: 62da41-2019.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper argues that standard neural networks do not adapt computation to task complexity and frames this as a missing capability.
- It introduces PonderNet, which changes the computation process by learning when to halt via a probabilistic halting policy.

## Evidence extracts
- "Most machine learning algorithms do not adjust their computational budget based on the complexity of the task they are learning to solve, or arguably, such adaptation is done manually by the machine learning practitioner." (p. 1)
- "We achieve this by reformulating the halting policy as a probabilistic model." (p. 2)
