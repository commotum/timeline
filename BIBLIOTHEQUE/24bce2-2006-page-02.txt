              Figure 1: The network used to model the joint distribution of digit images and
              digit labels. In this letter, each training case consists of an image and an explicit
              class label, but work in progress has shown that the same learning algorithm
              can be used if the “labels” are replaced by a multilayer pathway whose inputs
              are spectrograms from multiple different speakers saying isolated digits. The

              This hybrid model has some attractive features:

                    set of parameters quickly, even in deep networks with millions of
