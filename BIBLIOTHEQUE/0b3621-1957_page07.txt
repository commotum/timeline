printing or displaying an output signal, each response unit feeds back
impulses which inhibit, or cut off the activity of all mutually exclusive
Reunits and the A-units which might activate them, These inhibitory feed-=
back connections guarantee that only one response out of a mutually
exclusive set can be triggered at one time. The response circuits are
designed in such a manner that if impulses arrive at two R-units simul-
taneously, the unit whose inputs have the greatest mean (or net) value
will respond first, cutting off the other through its inhibitory connections
before it can be trigcered. An entire set of mutually exclusive R-units
thus acts like a multiestable flip-flop, in which only one stage can be
"on" at any one time. Several such mutually exclusive R-units may exist
in parallel, as, for instance, the ten alphabets necessary to provide

for printing a ten letter word. In such a case, the system is organized

as in Fig. 2, with a distinct A-set corresponding to each Reset.

In Fig. 3, a more detailed breakdown is shown illustrating
the logical composition of a perceptron designed to produce a three-=
binary-digit number as an output. Each binary place in the number is
represented by an R-set of two members, zero and one. In Figure 3,
circles have been used to represent sets of functional units, and
rectangles to represent single units, The figure illustrates the effect
of inhibitory connections when the response "101" is "on", All shaded
areas of the diagram would be under inhibition while this response was
active. Note that the intersection of an active A-set with an inhibited
A-set is not inhibited, i.e., inhibitory connections go from each Reunit

only to those A+subsets which do not contribute connections to it.

The entire organization of a system of this sort can be
represented by a single table, or matrix of connections between units.
The system of Fig. 3, for example, might be represented by a table such
as that of Fige le
