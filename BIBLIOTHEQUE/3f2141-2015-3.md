# Learning to Transduce with Unbounded Memory (2015)
Source: 3f2141-2015.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes memory-augmented recurrent networks that implement differentiable stack/queue/deque data structures, i.e., a new computation mechanism for transduction.
- Frames RNNs as limited by memory capacity and introduces an extensible memory enhancement to change how computation/memory works.

## Evidence extracts
- "These experiments lead us to propose new memory-based recur-
rent networks that implement continuously differentiable analogues of traditional
data structures such as Stacks, Queues, and DeQues." (p. 1)
- "In this section, we present an extensible memory enhancement to recurrent layers which can be set
up to act as a continuous version of a classical Stack, Queue, or DeQue (double-ended queue)." (p. 2)
