including several independent sets, words can be built up, or percepts
can be analyzed according to several independent attributes simulta-
neously, A crude estimate indicates that a system with two to three
thousand A-units should be capable of maintaining a vocabulary comparable

to the English language, if connection parameters were properly optimized,

In order to maximize system capacity, and to reduce the
learning process for new objects, it would be desirable to reduce the
set of transformations, T, of a particular stimulus pattern by center-
ing the pattern in the field of view of the input camera. By including
an independent Reset with feedback to a set of camera~aiming servos,
the system can readily be made to train the camera on any forms occur-
ing in peripheral locations in the field, without actually discriminating
the particular forms, For this purpose, it would be necessary only to
learn to distinguish the presence or absence of stimuli in different
locations in the field, associating the presence of a pattern in the
lower left, for example, with a control response moving the camera in
this direction, The system would then be able to "fixate" any pattern
which might prove significant, in much the same mamer as the human eye,
limiting its "recognition learning" to a relatively limited central

field, analogous to the fovea in human vision.
