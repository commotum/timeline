# General Program Synthesis Benchmark Suite (2015)
Source: 3d5f48-2015.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper presents a benchmark suite for general program synthesis.
- It specifies per-problem inputs/outputs and recommended training/test set sizes, indicating a benchmarking resource and evaluation protocol.

## Evidence extracts
- "General Program Synthesis Benchmark Suite" (p. 1)
- "Table 1: For each problem, the types of the inputs and outputs, and the limits imposed on the inputs. Any
printed outputs should be printed by the program to standard output. The columns Train and Test indicate
the recommended sizes of the training set and test set respectively." (p. 4)
