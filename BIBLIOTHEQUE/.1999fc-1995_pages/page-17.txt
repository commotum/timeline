about the geometry of the problem. In fact the classifier would do as well if the
image pixels were encrypted e.g. by a fixed, random permutation.

The last remark suggests that further improvement of the performance of the support-
vector network can be expected from the construction of functions for the dot-product
Ku, v) that reflect a priori information about the problem at hand.

7. Conclusion

This paper introduces the suppori-vector network as a new learning machine for two-group
classification problems.

The support-vector network combines 3 ideas: the solution technique from optimal hy-
perplanes (that allows for an expansion of the solution vector on support vectors), the idea of
convolution of the dot-product (that extends the solution surfaces from linear to non-linear),
and the notion of soft margins (to allow for errors on the training set).
