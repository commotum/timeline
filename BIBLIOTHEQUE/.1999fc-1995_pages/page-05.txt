The optimal hyperplane

is the unique one which separates the training data with a maximal margin: it determines
the direction w/|w| where the distance between the projections of the training vectors of
two different classes is maximal, recall Fig. 2. This distance p(w, /) is given by

The optimal hyperplane (wo, bo) is the arguments that maximize the distance (12). It follows
