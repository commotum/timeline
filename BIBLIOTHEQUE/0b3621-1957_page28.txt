Thus, we see that each of the associations which we tried to form has
actually been established, in spite of the fact that the Ry associations
have added to the value of the Ry subset for all stimulus patterns, and
the Ry associations have similarly added an increment to the Ry subsets
of all stimuli. The expected communality proportion, in this model, is
equal to 5/16, which, together with the small number of A-units, would
cause us to expect rather poor performance from the system. It is
interesting to note that, even under these conditions, all six associa-=
tions have been retained correctly.

To make sure that we have not accidentally selected a
biased set of patterns, which lend themselves to the particular
associations we have considered, let us try reversing each one of the
3 to Ros
the other three stimuli to Ry» by the same procedure that we used
before. In this case, the resulting value distribution is given by

associations, i.¢e, we will now associate Sys Sos and § and
