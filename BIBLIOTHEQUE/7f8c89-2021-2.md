# PCT: Point cloud transformer (2021)
Source: 7f8c89-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a Transformer-based framework (PCT) for point cloud learning, indicating a Transformer adapted beyond 1D sequences.
- Focuses on unstructured point clouds with an irregular domain, which aligns with adapting Transformers to higher-dimensional data.

## Evidence extracts
- "point cloud learning. PCT is based on Transformer," (p. 1)
- "on unstructured point clouds with irregular domain." (p. 10)

## Classification
Class name: Increasing Transformer's Dimensions
Class code: 2
