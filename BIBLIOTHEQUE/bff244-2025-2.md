# BWFormer: Building Wireframe Reconstruction from Airborne LiDAR Point Cloud with Transformer (Not specified in the paper)
Source: bff244-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper presents a Transformer-based model for building wireframe reconstruction from airborne LiDAR point clouds, i.e., a higher-dimensional spatial domain.
- It predicts 3D corners with a Transformer-based network as part of the core method, showing the Transformer adaptation to 3D geometry.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, we present BWFormer, a novel Transformer- based model for building wireframe reconstruction from airborne LiDAR point cloud." (p. 1)
- "Then, 3D corners are pre- dicted by a Transformer-based network with extra height embedding initialization." (p. 1)
