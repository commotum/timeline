                  Urban scene generation has been developing rapidly recently. However, existing methods primarily
                  focus on generating static and single-frame scenes, overlooking the inherently dynamic nature of
                  real-world driving environments. In this work, we introduce DynamicCity, a novel 4D occupancy
                  generation framework capable of generating large-scale, high-quality dynamic 4D scenes with semantics.

                  4Drepresentation. Instead of using naive averaging operations, DynamicCity employs a novel Projection
                  Module to effectively compress 4D features into six 2D feature maps for HexPlane construction, which
                  significantly enhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to 12.56 mIoU gain). Furthermore, we utilize
                  an Expansion&SqueezeStrategy to reconstruct 3D feature volumes in parallel, which improves both
                  network training efÏciency and reconstruction accuracy than naively querying each 3D point (up
                  to 7.05 mIoU gain, 2.06x training speedup, and 70.84% memory reduction). (2) A DiT-based
                  diffusion model for HexPlane generation. To make HexPlane feasible for DiT generation, a Padded
                  RolloutOperation is proposed to reorganize all six feature planes of the HexPlane as a squared 2D
                  feature map. In particular, various conditions could be introduced in the diffusion or sampling
                  process, supporting versatile 4D generation applications, such as trajectory- and command-driven
                  generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned generation. Extensive experiments on the CarlaSC and
                  Waymo datasets demonstrate that DynamicCity significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D
                  occupancy generation methods across multiple metrics. The code and models have been released to
                  facilitate future research.

               Urbanscenegenerationhasgarneredgrowingattentionrecently, whichcouldbenefitvariousrelatedapplications,
               such as robotics and autonomous driving. Compared to its 3D object generation counterpart, generating
               urban scenes remains an under-explored field, with many new research challenges such as the presence of
               numerous moving objects, large-scale scenes, and long temporal sequences [15]. For example, in autonomous
               driving scenarios, a scene typically comprises multiple objects from various categories, such as vehicles,
               pedestrians, and vegetation, captured over a long sequence (e.g., 200 frames) spanning a large area (e.g.,
                                3
               80×80×6.4meters ). Although in its early stages, 4D occupancy generation holds great potential to enhance
               the understanding of the 3D world, with wide-reaching and profound implications.
               Due to the complexity of occupancy data, many efÏcient learning frameworks have been introduced for
               large-scale 3D scene generation. X3 [30] utilizes a hierarchical voxel diffusion model to generate outdoor 3D
               scenes based on VDB data structure. PDD [18] introduces a pyramid discrete diffusion model to progressively
               generate high-quality 3D scenes. SemCity [17] resolves outdoor scene generation by leveraging a triplane
