                Supplementary information S3 (box): The free-energy principle and infomax 
                Here, we show that the free-energy principle is a probabilistic generalisation of the infomax 
                                                                     %
                principle.  The  infomax principle requires the mutual information  I(s,µ) between sensory 
                data and their conditional representation  µ(t) to be maximal, under prior constraints on the 
                representations; e.g.,  p(µ) = N (0,I). This can be stated as an optimisation of an infomax 
                criterion

                                                                              S3.1 
                      %
                 G=I(s,µ)−H(µ)

                   =H(s)−H(s|µ)−H(µ)
                 
                Because the representations do not change sensory data, they are only required to minimise 
                the average surprise about them, given the representations; and the average surprise about 
                the representations, given their prior constraints. These are the last two terms in (S3.1). If the 
                recognition density is a point  mass at  µ(t); i.e.,  q(ϑ) =δ(ϑ −µ), the  free-energy from 
                (S2.4) reduces to 
                 
                          %
                F =−ln p(s|µ)−ln p(µ)                                         S3.2 
                 
                From (S1.1), the path-integral of free-energy (also known as free-action) becomes 
                 
                          %           %
                AF=∫dt (s(t),µ(t))µ H(s|µ)+H(µ)                               S3.3 
                 
                This means optimising the conditional expectations with respect to free-energy and (by the 
                fundamental  lemma  of  variational  calculus)  free-action,  is  exactly  the  same  as  same  as 
                optimising the infomax criterion
