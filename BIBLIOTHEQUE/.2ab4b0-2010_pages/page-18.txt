               In short, the infomax principle is a special case of the free-energy principle that obtains when 
               we discount uncertainty and represent sensory data with point estimates of their causes. 
               Alternatively,  the  free-energy  is  a  generalisation  of  the  infomax  principle  that  covers 
               probability densities on the unknown causes of data. In this context, high mutual information 
               is assured by maximising accuracy (e.g., minimising prediction error) and the prior constraints 
               are enforced by minimising complexity (see S2.4)
