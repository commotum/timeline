                       Here,  γ > 0 encodes the amplitude of the random fluctuations (and is known as an inverse 
                       sensitivity  or  temperature  parameter).  The  first  equality  shows  that  value  is  inversely 
                       proportional to surprise, where free-energy is surprise because we know the true states. This 
                       means the value of a state is proportional to the log-probability of finding an agent  m  in that 
                       state. This is also the log-sojourn time or the proportion of time the state is occupied by that 
                       agent.  
                        
                       In  the  limit  of  small  fluctuations  γ → 0,  the  ensemble  density        %               −1   %

                       becomes a point mass at the minimum of the cost-function. This somewhat trivial case serves 
                       to connect optimal control theory to the equilibrium treatment that underpins the free-energy 
                       scheme. In this limit, cost is just the rate of change of value:          %                & %      , as 
                                                                                              c(x) = f ⋅∇V =V(x(t))

                       (deterministic) Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (S4.2).  
                        
                       Crucially, Equation S4.3 also shows that peaks of the equilibrium density can only exist where 
                       cost is zero or less

                       In summary, optimal control theory starts with a cost-function and solves for a value-function 
                       that  guides  the  flow  or  policy  to  minimise  expected  cost.  Conversely,  the  equilibrium
