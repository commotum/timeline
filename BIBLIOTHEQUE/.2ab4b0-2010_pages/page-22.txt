                    This box describes a scheme that ensures agents are attracted to locations in state-space, 
                    using prior expectations about the motion of hidden states;  %          ′ T      comprising 
                                                                                 x(t) =[x,x ] ∈X
                    position and velocity. This formulation of how an ensemble density can be restricted to an 
                    attractive subset of state-space  A⊂ X  rests on the Fokker-Planck description (see Frank 
                    2004) of how the density changes with time

                    Notice that as the divergence ∇⋅ f   increases, the sojourn time (i.e., the proportion of time a 
                    state is occupied) falls. Crucially, at the peaks of the ensemble density, the gradient is zero 
                    and its curvature is negative, which means the divergence must be negative (from Equation 
                    S5.1)

                    This provides a simple and general mechanism to ensure peaks of the ensemble density lie

                    otherwise. We can exploit this using the generic equations of motion
