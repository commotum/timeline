                                                  Abstract | A free-energy principle has been proposed recently that accounts for action, 
                                                  perception and learning. This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for 
                                                  example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal 
                                                  control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs 
                                                  through each of these theories — optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is 
                                                  optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected 
                                                  utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that 
                                                  is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain
