              to a change of variables and assumes that the sensory mapping  g : x → s   is diffeomorphic 
              (i.e., bijective and smooth). This requires the hidden and sensory state-spaces to have the 
              same dimension, which can be assured by truncating generalised states at an appropriately 
              high order. For example, if we had  n hidden states in  m  generalised coordinates of motion, 
              we  would  consider  m  sensory  states  in  n  generalised  coordinates;  so  that

              In conclusion, the entropy of hidden states is upper-bounded by the entropy of sensations, 
              assuming their sensitivity to hidden states is constant, over the range of states encountered. 
               
              Clearly,  the  ergodic  assumption  in  S1.1  only  holds  over  certain  temporal  scales  for  real 
              organisms that are on a trajectory from birth to death. This scale can be somatic (e.g., over 
              days  or  months,  where  development  is  locally  stationary)  or  evolutionary  (e.g.,  over 
              generations, where evolution is locally stationary).
