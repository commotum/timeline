# CLUTRR: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Inductive Reasoning from Text (2019)
Source: 6021b0-2019.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces CLUTRR as a diagnostic benchmark suite for evaluating robustness and systematicity in NLU, making the benchmark the central contribution.
- Defines the benchmark task setup (stories of kinship relations) to test inductive reasoning, emphasizing evaluation rather than a new model.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this work, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark suite, named CLUTRR, to clarify some key issues related to the robustness and systematicity of NLU systems." (p. 1)
- "The core idea behind the CLUTRR benchmark suite is the following: Given a natural language story describing a set of kinship relations, the goal is to infer the relationship between two entities, whose relationship is not explicitly stated in the story." (p. 3)
