# A Mathematical Theory of Communication (1948)
Source: 024258-1948.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper explicitly frames itself as a mathematical theory of communication and defines the components of a communication system, indicating a foundational communications/information-theory focus rather than an ML modeling contribution.
- It is reprinted from The Bell System Technical Journal (1948), positioning it as external foundational context for later ML work rather than a dataset, benchmark, or model mechanism.
