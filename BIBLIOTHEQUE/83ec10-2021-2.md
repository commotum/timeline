# Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)
Source: 83ec10-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a vision Transformer backbone for computer vision, explicitly framing the work as adapting Transformers from language to vision.
- Introduces a hierarchical, shifted-window architecture to model images efficiently, enabling Transformer use on high-resolution visual inputs.

## Evidence extracts
- "This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called
SwinTransformer,thatcapablyservesasageneral-purpose
backbone for computer vision." (Abstract)
- "To address these
differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose
representation is computed with Shifted windows." (Abstract)
