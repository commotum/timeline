           Figure 4: An illustration of the agent’s input context over two timesteps, t and t + 1. At each
           timestep, the agent processes a chat-formatted history composed of a system prompt, user messages
           (green observationandgrayinstruction),andassistantmessages(yellowplanandblue
           action). Theagent receives the history of interactions and in this case it generates a new plan and
           action. In the subsequent timestep t + 1, the input history is updated: the plan and action generated
           at t are appended to the interaction history together with new observation, and the previous plan
           is removed. During experiments, to manage context length, the history provided to the agent was
           truncated to a maximum of 16 observations.
