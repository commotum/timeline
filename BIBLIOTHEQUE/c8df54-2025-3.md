# Reflection System for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (2025)
Source: c8df54-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a reflection-based multi-stage inference mechanism where candidate solutions are produced by solvers and a reflection model selects the final answer.
- Focuses on improving reasoning performance by changing how computation is orchestrated across solvers, not on positional encoding, dimensional lifting, or dataset-only contributions.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this work, we introduce a Reflection System for ARC." (p. 1)
- "In our system, the reflection model processes all generated predictions from all the ARC solvers. Conditioning on the given ARC task, the reflection model chooses the prediction from the solver that is most likely to be correct." (p. 4)
