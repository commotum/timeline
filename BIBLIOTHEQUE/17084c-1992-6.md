Source: 17084c-1992.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper is a neuroscience account of visual pathways for perception and action (ventral/dorsal streams), not a machine-learning model contribution.
- It focuses on cortical brain systems and perceptual/action mechanisms, serving cross-disciplinary foundations rather than ML methods.
