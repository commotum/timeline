                        of attention weights is over different time steps based on different heads over all the facts in the story and a
                        question. Different color bars on the left side indicate attention weights based on different heads (4 heads in total).
                         An example from tasks 1:   (requiring one supportive fact to solve)
                         Story:
                                                    John travelled to the hallway.
                                                    Mary journeyed to the bathroom.
                                                    Daniel went back to the bathroom.
                                                    John moved to the bedroom
                         Question:
                                                    Where is Mary?
