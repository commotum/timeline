                                With respect to their computational power, the key difference between the Transformer and the Universal

                                executes a total number of operations that scales with the input size, the number of sequential operations is
                                constant, independentoftheinputsizeanddeterminedsolelybythenumberoflayers. Assumingﬁniteprecision,

                                Notethatthis holds independently of whether or not adaptive computation time is employed but does assume

                                training is enabled by sharing weights across sequential computation steps in the Universal Transformer.
                                Anintuitive example are functions whose execution requires the
                                sequential processing of each input element. In this case, for any
                                given choice of depth T, one can construct an input sequence of
                                length N > T that cannot be processed correctly by a standard
                                Transformer. Withanappropriate,input-lengthdependentchoiceof
