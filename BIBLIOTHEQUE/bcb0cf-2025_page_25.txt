                    Figure 9: (a) Temporal Dynamics of the Objective Function Across Training Epochs for Distinct Random
                    Seeds. The graph offers an incisive look into the objective function’s evolution over the training epochs,
                    integrating both accuracy and computational efficiency into its formulation. Each trace corresponds to a
                    unique random seed, thereby providing a robust measure of the model’s resilience to varying initial conditions.
                   (b) Interplay Between Layer Selection Frequency, Penalty Term λ, and Validation Accuracy. This tri-axis plot
                    delivers a granular portrayal of how layer selection frequency and validation accuracy respond to changes in
                    the penalty term λ.
                    for the comparative experiment. The findings, described in Figure 7, validate the efficacy of this approach by
                    showcasing noticeably improved performance metrics for the pre-trained model.

                   Akeyobservation here is the emergent stabilization of the objective function as the training epoch count
                    ascends. This equilibrium is indicative of the introspection model’s escalating competence in judiciously
                    selecting layers that not only enhance performance but also optimize computational expenditure. Further
                    nuance in the introspection model’s decision-making process is captured in Figure 9(b). Each curve on
                    the plot signifies the frequency with which the introspection model elects to utilize a specific layer across
                    the spectrum of available λ penalty terms. Accompanying these curves is a dashed line that represents the
                   validation accuracy achieved under these conditions. Higher λ values act as deterrents against the selection
                    of computationally burdensome layers, compelling the introspection model towards more resource-efficient
                    alternatives. This in-depth analysis fortifies the understanding of the introspection model’s role within MIND
                    model, particularly its aptitude for adaptively managing computational resources without compromising
                    modelperformance. The introspection model’s proficiency in this balancing act is pivotal for the scalability
                    and applicability of MIND model across a wide range of tasks and computational settings.
