# Olympiad-level formal mathematical reasoning with reinforcement learning (2025)
Source: c74458-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Presents AlphaProof, an RL-trained agent for formal proof search, targeting complex mathematical reasoning.
- Introduces Test-Time RL for inference-time adaptation on difficult problems, changing how computation proceeds during reasoning.

## Evidence extracts
- "We present AlphaProof, an AlphaZero-inspired<sup>2</sup> agent that learns to find formal proofs through RL by training on millions of auto-formalized problems." (Section Abstract)
- "For the most difficult problems, it uses Test-Time RL, a method of generating and learning from millions of related problem variants at inference time to enable deep, problem-specific adaptation." (Section Abstract)
