            9.2 HexPlane-GuidedGeneration
            Weshow results for our HexPlane conditional generation in Fig. 11. Although the sequences are generated in
            groups of 16 due to the settings of our VAE, we successfully generate a long sequence by conditioning on the
            previous one. The result contains 64 frames, comprising four sequences, and depicts a T-intersection with
            many cars parked along the roadside. This result demonstrates strong temporal consistency across sequences,
            proving that our framework can effectively predict the next sequence based on the current one.
