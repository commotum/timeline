and the first part of the electrode track. The units recorded in the course of
the penetration are indicated in Text-fig. 13 by the longer lines crossing
the track; the unresolved background activity by the shorter lines. The
orientations of the most effective stimuli are given by the directions of the
lines, a line perpendicular to the track signifying a vertical orientation.
For the first part of the penetration, through the apical segment, the field
orientation was vertical for all cells as well as for the background activity.

Text-fig. 14. Reconstructions of two penetrations in apical segment of post-lateral
gyrus, near its anterior end (just behind anterior interrupted line in Text-fig. 1,
see also Pl. 2). Medial penetration is slightly oblique, lateral one is markedly so.
All receptive fields were located within 1° of area centralis, Conventions as in
Text-fig. 13. Scale 1 mm.

Fibres were recorded from the white matter and from the grey matter just
beyond it. Three of these fibres were axons of cortical cells having fields
Of Various Oblique orientations; four were afferent fibres from the lateral
geniculate body. In the mesial segment three short sequences were en-
countered, each with a different common field orientation. These sequences
together occupied a distance smaller than the full thickness of the apical
segment,

Th another experiment, illustrated in Text-fig. 14 and im Pl. 2, two pene-
trations were made, both in the apical segment of the post-lateral gyrus:
The medial penetration (at left in the figure) was at the outset almost
normal to the cortex, but deviated more and more from the direction of
the deep fibre bundles. In this penetration there were three different axis
orientations, of which the first and third persisted through long sequences.
