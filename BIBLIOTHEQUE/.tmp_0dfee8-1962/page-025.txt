Text-fig. 13. Reconstruction of micro-clectrode penetration through the lateral
gytus (see also Pl. 1), Electrode entered apical segment normal to the surface, and
remained parallel to the deep fibre bundles (indicated by radial lines) until reaching
white matter; in grey matter of mesial segment the electrode’s course was oblique.
Longer lines represent cortical cells. Axons of cortical cells are indicated by a cross-
bar at right-hand end of line. Field-axis orientation is shown by the direction of
each line; lines perpendicular to track represent vertical orientation. Brace-
brackets show simultaneously recorded units. Complex receptive fields are indi-
cated by ‘Cx’. Afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate body indicated by x,
for ‘on’ centre; A, for ‘off’ centre. Approximate positions of receptive fields on
the retina are shown to the right of the penetration. Shorter lines show regions in
which unresolved background activity was observed. Numbers to the left of the
penetration refer to ocular-dominance group (see Part II). Scale 1 mm,
