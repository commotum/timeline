Heceplive-field orgamzation
Multiple recordings. The receptive fields of cells observed together in
multiple recordings were always of similar complexity, ie. they were
either all simple or al! complex in their organization. In about one third
of the multiple recordings the cells had the same detailed field organiza-
tion; if simple, they had similar distributions of excitatory and inhibitory

Text-fig. 15. Reconstruction of part of an electrode track through apical and
mesial segments of post-lateral gyrus near its anterior end. Two lesions were made,
the first after recording from the first unit, the second at the end of the penetration.
Only the first twelve cells are represented. Interrupted lines show boundaries of
layer 4.

In the centre part of the figure the position of each receptive field, outlined with
interrupted lines, is given with respect to the area centralis, shown by a cross.
Cells are numbered in sequence, 1-12. Numbers in parentheses refer to ocular-
dominance group (see Part II). Units 5 and 6, 8 and 9 were observed simultaneously.
The first three fields and the last were complex in organization; the remainder were
simple. x, areas giving excitation; A, areas giving inhibitory effects. Note that
all receptive fields except the last have the same axis orientation (9.30-3.30
o'clock). The arrows show the preferred direction of movement of a slit oriented
parallel to the receptive-field axis.

In the left part of the figure all of the receptive fields are superimposed, to indi-
cate the overlap and variation in size. The vertical and horizontal] lines represent
meridia, crossing at the area centralis. Scale on horizontal meridian, 1° for each
subdivision.
