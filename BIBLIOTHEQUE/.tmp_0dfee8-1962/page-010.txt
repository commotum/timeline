reduction in the response (Text-fig. 4Z-G). As usual, diffuse light had
no influence on the firing. This cell responded especially well if the
slit, oriented as in A—D, was moved steadily across the receptive field.
Sustained discharges were evoked over the entire length of the field. The
optimum rate of movement was about 1°/sec. If movement was inter-
rupted the discharge stopped, and when it was resumed the firing recom-
menced. Continuous firing could be maintained indefinitely by smail side-

The pattern of firing was one characteristic of many complex cells, especially
those responding well to moving stimuli. It consisted of a series of short
high-frequency repetitive discharges each containing 5-10 spikes. The
