have good contrast between the narrow black rectangle and the back-
ground; this is technically difficult with a projector because of scattered
light.

Slow downward movement of the dark rectangle evoked a strong dis-
charge throughout the entire 5° of the receptive field (Text-fig. 8.4). If
the movement was halted the cell continued to fire, but less vigorously.

Text-fig. 7. Cell activated only by left (contralateral) eye over a field approxi-
mately 5 x 5°, situated 10° above and to the left of the area centralis. The cell re-
sponded best to a black horizontal rectangle, $ x 6°, placed anywhere in the recep-
tive field (A-C). Tilting the stimulus rendered it ineffective (D-E). The black bar
was introduced against a light background during periods of 1 sec, indicated by
the upper line in each record. Luminance of white background, 1-0 logy, ed/m?;
luminance of black part, 0-0 log,) ed/m*. A lesion, made while recording from the
cell, was found in layer 2 of apical segment of post-lateral gyrus.

Upward movement gave only weak, inconsistent responses, and left-right
movement (Text-fig. 8B) gave no responses. Discharges of highest fre-
quency were evoked by relatively slow rates of downward movement
(about 5-10 sec to cross the entire field); rapid movement in either direc-
tion gave only very weak responses.

Despite its unusual features this cell exhibited several properties typical
of complex units, particularly the lack of summation (except in a hori-
zontal sense), and the wide area over which the dark bar was effective.
One may think of the field as having a counterpart in simple fields of type
D, Text-fig. 2. In such fields a dark bar would evoke discharges, but only
if it fell within the inhibitory region. Moreover, downward movement of
