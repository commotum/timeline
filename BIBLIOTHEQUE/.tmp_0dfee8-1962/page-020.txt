eye. Finally, even if no response was obtained from the non-dominant eye,
the two eyes were stimulated together in parallel to see if their effects were
synergistic. With these methods, an influence was frequently observed
from the non-dominant eye that might otherwise have been overlooked.

Text-fig. 11. Movement of a } x 2° slit back and forth horizontally across the
receptive field of a binocularly influenced cell. A, left eye; B, right eye; C, both
eyes. The cell clearly preferred left-to-right movement, but when both eyes were
stimulated together it responded also to the reverse direction. Field diameter, 2°,
situated 5° from the area centralis. Time, 1 sec.

A comparison of the influence of the two eyes was made for 223 of the
303 cells in the present series. The remaining cells were either not suffi-
ciently studied, or they belonged to the small group of cells which were
only activated if both eyes were simultaneously stimulated. The fields
of all cells were in or near the area centralis. The 223 cells were subdivided
into seven groups, as follows:

Group Ocular dominance

1 Exclusively contralateral

2* Contralateral eye much more effective than ipsilateral eye
3 Contralateral eye slightly more effective than ipsilateral

4 No obvious difference in the effects exerted by the two eyes
5 Ipsilateral eye slightly more effective

6* Ipsilateral eye much more effective

7 Exclusively ipsilateral

* These groups include cells in which the non-dominant eye, ineffective by itself, could
influence the response to stimulation of the dominant eye.

A histogram showing the distribution of cells among these seven groups
is given in Text-fig. 12. Assignment of a unit to a particular group was to
some extent arbitrary, but it is unlikely that many cells were misplaced
by more than one group. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the
