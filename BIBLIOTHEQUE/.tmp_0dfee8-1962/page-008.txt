types of cells. In the following examples, four types of complex fields will
be illustrated. The numbers observed of each type are given in Table 2.

TaBLe 2, Complex cortical receptive fields

Text-fig. No. of cells
(a) Activated by slit—non-uniform field 3 iH
(6) Activated by slit—uniform field 4 39
(ce) Activated by edge 5-6 14
(d) Activated by dark bar 7-8 6
Total number of complex fields 70

The cell of Text-fig. 3 failed to respond to round spots of light, whether
small or large. By trial and error with many shapes of stimulus it was
discovered that the cells firing could be influenced by a horizontally
oriented slit 4° wide and 3° Jong. Provided the slit was horizontal its exact

Text-fig. 3. Responses of a cell with a complex receptive field to stimulation of
the left (contralateral) eye. Receptive field located in area centralis. The diagrams
to the left of each record indicate the position of a horizontal rectangular light
stimulus with respect to the receptive field, marked by a cross. In each record the
upper line indicates when the stimulus is on. A-E, stimulus } x 3°, F-G, stimulus
1} x 3° (4° is equivalent to 1mm on the cat retina). For background illumination
and stimulus intensity see Methods. Cell was activated in the same way from right
eye, but less vigorously (ocular-dominance group 2, see Part II), An electrolytic
lesion made while recording from this cell was found near the border of layers 5
and 6, in the apical segment of the post-lateral gyrus. Positive deflexions upward;
duration of each stimulus | sec.
