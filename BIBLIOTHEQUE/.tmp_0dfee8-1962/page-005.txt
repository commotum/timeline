CAT VISUAL CORTEX lil

by two rezions of the opposite type. In these fields the two flanking regions
were symmetrical, i.e. they were about equal in area and the responses
obtained from them were of about the same magnitude. In addition there
were fields with long narrow centres (excitatory or inhibitory) and asym-
metrical flanks. An example of an asymmetrical field with an inhibitory
centre is shown in Text-fig. 27. The most effective stationary stimulus for
all of these cells was a long narrow rectangle (‘slit’) of light just large

enough to cover the central region without invading either flank. For
maximum centre response the orientation of the slit was critical; changing
the orientation by more than 5-10° was usually enough to reduce a re-
sponse greatly or even abolish it. Illuminating both flanks usually evoked
a strong response. If a slit having the same size as the receptive-field
centre was shone in either flanking area it evoked only a weak response,
since it covered only part of one flank. Diffuse light was ineffective, or at
most evoked only a very weak response, indicating that the excitatory and
inhibitory parts of the receptive field were very nearly balanced.

In these fields the equivalent but opposite-type regions occupied retinal
