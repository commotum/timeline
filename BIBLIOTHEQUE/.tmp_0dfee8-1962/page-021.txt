CAT VISUAL CORTEX 127

histogram is its lack of symmetry: many more cells were dominated by the
contralateral than by the ipsilateral eye (106 vs. 62). We conclude that in
the part of the cat’s striate cortex representing central vision the great
majority of cells are influenced by both eyes, and that despite wide varia-
tion in relative ocular dominance from one cell to the next, the contra-
lateral eye is, on the average, more influential, As the shaded portion

Text-fig. 12. Distribution of 223 cells recorded from the visual cortex, according
to ocular dominance. Histogram includes cells with simple fields and cells with
complex fields. The shaded region shows the distribution of cells with complex re-
ceptive fields, Cells of group 1 were driven only by the contralateral eye; for cells
of group 2 there was marked dominance of the contralateral eye, for group 3,
slight dominance. For cells in group 4 there was no obvious difference between
the two eyes. In group 5 the ipsilateral eye dominated slightly, in group 6,
markedly; and in group 7 the cells were driven only by the ipsilateral eye.

of Text-fig. 12 shows, there is no indication that the distribution among
the various dominance groups of cells having complex receptive fields
difters from the distribution of the population as a whole.

A cortical bias in favour of the contralateral eye may perhaps be related
to the preponderance of crossed. over uncrossed fibres in the cat’s optic
