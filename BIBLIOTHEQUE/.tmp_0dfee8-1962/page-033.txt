short, and the error in electrode position correspondingly more im-
portant.

The distribution of 179 cells among the different layers is given in the
histograms of Text-fig. 18. All cells were recorded in penetrations in which
at least one lesion was made, the shaded portions refer to cells which
were individually marked with lesions. As shown in the separate histo-
grams, simple-feld cells as well as those with complex fields were widely
distributed throughout the cortex. Cells with simple fields were most
numerous in layers 3, 4 and 6. Especially interesting is the apparent
rarity of complex fields in layer 4, where simple fields were so abundant.
This is also illustrated in Text-fig. 15, which shows a sequence of eight cells

Text-fig. 18. Distribution of 179 cells, 113 with simple fields, 66 with complex,
among the different cortical layers. All cells were recorded in penetrations in
which at least one electrolytic lesion was made and identified; the shaded areas
refer to cells marked individually by lesions. Note especially the marked difference
in the occurrence, in layer 4, between simple and complex fields.
