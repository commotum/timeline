with complex fields the widths of the most effective slits or dark bars were
also of this order, indicating that despite the greater overall field size these
cells were able to convey detailed information. We wish to emphasize that
in both geniculate and cortex the field dimensions tend to increase with
distance from the area centralis, and that they differ even for a given
location in the retina. It is consequently not possible to compare field
sizes in the geniculate and cortex unless these variations are taken into
account. This may explain the discrepancy between our results and the
findings of Baumgartner (see Jung, 1960), that ‘field centres’ in the
cortex are one half the size of those in the lateral geniculate body.

Text-fig. 9. Distribution of 119 cells in the visual cortex with respect to the approxi-
mate area of their receptive fields, White columns indicate cells with simple recep-
tive fields; shaded columns, cells with complex fields. Abscissa: area of receptive
fields, Ordinate: number of cells.

Responsiveness of cortical cells

Simple and complex fields together account for all of the cells we have
recorded in the visual cortex. We have not observed cells with concentric
fields. Except for clearly injured cells (showing extreme spike deformation
or prolonged high-frequency bursts of impulses) all units have responded
to visual stimulation, though it has occasionally taken several hours to
find the retinal region containing the receptive field and to work out the
optimum stimuli. Some cells responded only to stimuli which were
optimum in their retinal position and in their form, orientation and rate of
