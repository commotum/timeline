not at all to slits, whether narrow or wide. It is interesting in this con-
nexion that exchanging an edge for its mirror equivalent reversed the
response, i.e. replaced an excitatory response by an inhibitory and vice
versa, The ineffectiveness of a slit might therefore be explained by sup-
posing that the opposite effects of its two edges tended to cancel each other.

Text-fig. 5. Responses of a cell with a large (8 x 16°) complex receptive field to an
edge projected on the ipsilateral retina so as to cross the receptive field in various
directions. (The screen is illuminated by a diffuse background light, at 0-0 logiy
ed/m*. At the time of stimulus, shown by upper line of each record, half the
sereen, to one side of the variable boundary, is illuminated at 1-0 log,. ed/m?, while
the other half is kept constant.) A, vertical edge with light area to left, darker area
to right. B-H, various other orientations of edge. Position of receptive field 20°
below and to the left of the area centralis. Responses from ipsilateral eye atronger
than those from contralateral eye (group 5, see Part II). Time 1 sec.

As shown in Text-fig. 6, the responses of the cell to a given vertical edge
were consistent in type, being either ‘on’ or ‘off’ for all positions of the
edge within the receptive field. In being uniform in its response-type it
resembled the cell of Text-fig. 4. A few other cells of the same general
category showed a similar preference for edges, but lacked this uniformity.
Their receptive fields resembled the field of Text-fig. 3, in that a given edge
evoked responses of one type over half the field, and the opposite type over
