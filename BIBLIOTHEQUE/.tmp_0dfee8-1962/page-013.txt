the other half. These fields were divided into two halves by a line parallel
to the receptive-field axis: an edge oriented parallel to the axis gave ‘on’
Tesponses throughout one of the haives and “off responses through the
other. In either half, replacing the edge by its mirror image reversed the
Tesponse-type. Hiven cells, which were uniform in their response-types,
like those in Text-fig. 4-6, varied to some extent in the magnitude of
their responses, depending on the position of the stimulus. Moreover, as
with most cortical ceils, there was some variation in responses to identical
stimuli,

Text-fig. 6. Same cell as in Text-fig. 5. A-H, responses to a vertical edge in
various parts of the receptive field: A—D, brighter light to the left; ZH, brighter
light to the right; J, large rectangle, 10 x 20°, covering entire receptive field. Time,
Tsec.

A final example is given to illustrate the wide range of variation in the
organization of complex receptive fields. The cell of Text-figs. 7 and 8 was
not strongly influenced by any form projected upon the screen; it gave only
weak, unsustained ‘on’ responses to a dark horizontal rectangle against. a
light background, and to other forms it was unresponsive. A strong dis-
charge was evoked, however, if a black rectangular object (for example, a
piece of black tape) was placed against the brightly illuminated screen.
The receptive field of the cell was about 5x 5°, and the most effective
stimulus width was about 4°. Vigorous firing was obtained regardless of
the position of the rectangle, as long as it was horizontal and within the
receptive field. If it was tipped more than 10° in either direction no dis-
charge was evoked (Text-fig. 7D, #). We have recorded several complex
fields which resembled this one in that they responded best to black
rectangles against a bright background. Presumably it is important to
