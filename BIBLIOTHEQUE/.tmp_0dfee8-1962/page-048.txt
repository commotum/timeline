EXPLANATION OF PLATES

Pate 1

Coronal section through post-lateral gyrus. Composite photomicrograph of two of the
sections used to reconstruct the micro-electrode track of Text-fig. 13. The firat part of the
electrode track may be seen in the upper right; the electrolytic lesion at the end of the track
appears in the lower left, Scale 1 mm.
PravE 2

A, coronal section through the anterior extremity of post-lateral gyrus. Composite photo-
micrograph made from four of the sections used to reconstruct the two electrode tracks
shown in Text-fig. 14. The first part of the two electrode tracks may be seen crossing layer 1.
The lesion at the end of the lateral track (to the right in the figure) is easily seen; that of the
medial track is smaller, and is shown at higher power in B. Scales: A, 1 mm, B, 0-25 mm.
