# LLFormer4D: LiDAR-based lane detection method by temporal feature fusion and sparse transformer (2025)
Source: a4e871-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper proposes a LiDAR-based lane detection method (LLFormer4D), applying Transformers in a sensor-driven perception setting.
- The method explicitly combines temporal feature fusion with Transformer networks, indicating a Transformer-centric architecture for this lane detection task.
