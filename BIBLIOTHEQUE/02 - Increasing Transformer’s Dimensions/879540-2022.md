# LIFT: Learning 4D LiDAR Image Fusion Transformer for 3D Object Detection (2022)
Source: 879540-2022.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a transformer-based LiDAR-image fusion architecture for sequential, spatiotemporal (4D) cross-sensor data, which is a Transformer adaptation to higher-dimensional sensing domains.
- Focuses on modeling 3D object detection from multi-frame LiDAR and camera inputs rather than introducing a dataset/benchmark or a positional encoding improvement.

## Evidence extracts
