# Transformer based 3D tooth segmentation via point cloud region partition (2024)
Source: b4a6ef-2024.pdf

## Core reasons
- The paper's main contribution is a Transformer-based network for 3D tooth segmentation on 3D point cloud data, adapting Transformers beyond 1D sequences.
- It explicitly frames the method as extending a 2D segmentation approach to 3D large-scale point cloud segmentation, indicating dimensional lifting.

## Evidence extracts
- "we propose a novel Transformer-based 3D tooth segmentation network, called PointRegion, which can process the entire point cloud at a low cost." (p. 1)
- "we propose a PointRegion network, which successfully extends the 2D segmentation method to 3D large-scale point cloud segmentation task." (p. 2)
