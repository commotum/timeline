# Point Primitive Transformer for Long-Term 4D Point Cloud Video Understanding (2022)
Source: 88f8f8-2022.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a 4D backbone for long-term point cloud video understanding, extending transformer-based modeling to 4D spatio-temporal data.
- Introduces a hierarchical transformer architecture (PPTr) tailored to 4D point cloud videos via primitive-level structure.

## Evidence extracts
- "This paper proposes a 4D backbone for long-term point cloud video understanding." (p. 14)
- "Point Primitive Transformer(PPTr) is a two-level hierarchical transformer built upon the geometry hierarchy induced by primitive planes" (p. 6)
