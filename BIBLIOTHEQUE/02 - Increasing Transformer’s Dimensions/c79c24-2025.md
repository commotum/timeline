# Point mask transformer for outdoor point cloud semantic segmentation (2025)
Source: c79c24-2025.pdf

## Core reasons
- Proposes a transformer-based network for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds, adapting Transformers to a higher-dimensional spatial domain.
- Frames the contribution as transforming point-cloud segmentation into mask-level prediction with a transformer decoder, emphasizing the 3D point-cloud setting.

## Evidence extracts
- "We propose a novel point cloud semantic segmentation network based on the transformer that transforms the point cloud semantic segmentation task from per-point classiﬁcation to mask classiﬁcation." (p. 2)
- "In this study, we applied a transformer architecture to segment the outdoor point clouds." (p. 3)
