# Point 4D Transformer Networks for Spatio-Temporal Modeling in Point Cloud Videos (2021)
Source: 81457a-2021.pdf

## Core reasons
- Introduces a transformer-based model (P4Transformer) for spatio-temporal modeling of raw point cloud videos.
- The work targets point cloud videos (spatio-temporal 3D data), adapting Transformers to a higher-dimensional domain.

## Evidence extracts
- "In this paper, to avoid tracking points, we propose a novel Point 4D Transformer Network (P4Transformer) to model the spatio-temporal structure in raw point cloud videos." (p. 2)
- "Point 4D Transformer Networks for Spatio-Temporal Modeling in Point Cloud Videos" (p. 1)
