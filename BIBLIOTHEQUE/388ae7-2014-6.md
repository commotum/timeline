# A hierarchy of intrinsic timescales across primate cortex (2014)
Source: 388ae7-2014.pdf

## Core reasons
- The work focuses on primate cortex and intrinsic timescales, indicating a neuroscience study rather than an ML modeling contribution.
- The study is based on neurophysiological measurements from single-neuron spike trains.

## Evidence extracts
- "A hierarchy of intrinsic timescales across primate cortex" (p. 1)
