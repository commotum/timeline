                     4.7.  CONDITIONAL  PREFIX  COMPLEXITY AND  COMPLEXITY OF  PAIRS            105
                           Indeed,  the  decompressor  D(y, z)  —  z  is  prefix  stable  (recall  that 
                      prefix-stability is about y, not z) and Kd(x\x) — 0.  We can also change 
                      it to get a prefix-free decompressor:  let D{A, z) = z where A is an empty 
                      string,  and  let  D(y, z)  be  undefined  if у  ф  Л.  Finally,  the  family  of 
                      semimeasures can be constructed as follows:  q(x\x) = 1 and q(z\x) — 0 
                      for z ф X.
                    • K(f(x, z)\z)  ^  K(x\z) + 0(1)  for  any  computable  function  /   and  for 
                      any strings x,z such that f(x,z) is defined.  (The constant in 0(1) may 
                      depend on / but not on x and z.)
                           Indeed,  let  D  be  the optimal  prefix-stable  (resp.  prefix-free)  condi­
                      tional  decompressor.    The  mapping  D' :  (y, z)  i-»  f(D(y,z),z)  is  also 
                      a  prefix-stable  (resp.  prefix-free)  decompressor  and  KD>(f(x,z)\z)  ^ 
                      KD(x\z).
                           In  terms  of semimeasures  the  same  argument  goes  as  follows:  let 
                      m{x\z)  be the a priori probability of x with condition z.  Consider the 
                      semimeasure
                                    q(x I z) = ^2{т(х/ I z) \ f(x', z) = x}
                      (for each z this is  an image of the semimeasure x h) m(x. z)  under the 
                      mapping x h) f(x, z)); it is easy to check that q is lower semicomputable, 
                      that  ^2xq{x\z)  <  1  and q{f(x, z) \ z)  ^ m(x\z).  Since m, is optimal,  we 
                      get the desired inequality for a priori probabilities and their logarithms.
                    •  K{f{x)\x) = 0(1) for any computable / and for all x such that f(x) is 
                      defined.
                           (A simple corollary.)
                    •  K(x\z) ^ K(x\f(z)) + 0(1) for every computable function /  and for all 
                      x, z if f(z) is defined (the constant in 0(1) may depend on /  but not on 
                      x and z).
                           (Indeed, consider the decompressor (y,z) н  D(y,f(z)) or the condi­
                      tional semimeasure q(x\z) = m(x \ f(z)).)
                    •  C(x I z) < K{x I z) + 0(1).
                          Indeed, prefix-stable and prefix-free decompressors form a subclass in 
                      the class of all decompressors used in the definition of C(x\z).
                    •  K(x I z) < C{x I z) + 2 log C(x\z) + 0(1).
                          This is a corollary of previous statements.  Indeed, let D be the opti­
                      mal conditional decompressor (not necessarily prefix stable or prefix free). 
                      Then
                           K(D{y,z)\z) ^K(y\z) + 0{1)
                                         ^ K(y) + 0(1) ^ l(y) + 21ogl(y) + 0(1).
                      If у is the shortest description of x with condition z, then l(y) = 0(.т|2:).
                          In the same way one can prove a stronger inequality
                         K(x\z) ^ C(x\z) + logC(x\z) + 2\og\ogC(x\z) + 0(1), 
                      etc.
                 4.7.3.  Prefix complexity of a pair.  As we have seen (Theorem 60, p. 97), 
             K(x, y) ^ K(x) + K(y) + 0(1).  Let us prove a stronger inequality:
                 Theorem 66.
                                      K{x,y) ^ K(x) + K(y\x) + 0(1).
