                                                               2.2.    CONDITIONAL COMPLEXITY                                                            37
                           Theorem 19.  Let (x,y) h-* k(x,y)  be an upper semicomputable function such 
                    that  the  set  {x  \  k(x,y)  <  n}  has  cardinality  less  than 2n  for  any  string y  and 
                    integer n.  Then C(x | у) < k(x, у) + c for some c and for all x  and y.
                           The proof repeats the proof of Theorem 8.
                           Using conditional complexity, we get a stronger inequality for the complexity 
                    of pairs (compared with Theorem 16, p. 31):
                           Theorem 20.
                                                  C(x, y) < C(x) + 2 log C(x) + C(y I x) + 0(1).
                           P r o o f.  Let D\  be an optimal unconditional decompressor, and let D2 be an 
                    optimal conditional decompressor.  Construct  a new unconditional decompressor 
                    D' as follows:
                                                              D'(pq) = [Di(p), D2(q, Di(p))\.
                    Here p stands for the prefix-free encoding of p, and  [•, •]  is a computable encoding 
                    of pairs  used in  the definition  of the complexity of pairs.  Let p be the shortest 
                    D\-description of x, and let q be the shortest ^-description of y conditional to x. 
                    Then the string pq is a ^-description of [x, у].  Therefore,
                                                C(x,y) < CD'(x, y) + 0(1) ^ l{p) + l{q) + 0(1).
                    As we have seen, one can choose a prefix-free encoding in such a way that l(p) is 
                    bounded by l(p) + 2 logl(p) + 0(1)  (see the proof of Theorem 16, p.  31),  and we 
                    get a desired inequality.                                                                                                           □
                           As before, we may replace 2 log C(x) by log C(x) + 2 log log C(x), etc., getting 
                    a better bound.  We also can use conditional complexity in the logarithmic term 
                    and write
                                                C(x, у) ^ C(x) -I- C(y I x) + 2 log C(y I x) + 0(1).
                    (In the proof we should then replace D'(pq) by D'(qp).)
                            34 Prove that
                                               C(x I z) < C(x \y) + 2logC(x Iy) + C(y \ z) + 0(1)
                    for all x, y, z  (a sort of triangle inequality).
                          If we are not interested in the exact form of the additional logarithmic term, 
                    the statement of Theorem 20 can be reformulated as
                                                          C(x, y) ^ C{x) + C(y I x) + O(logn)
                    for all strings x, y of length at most n.
                          It turns out1  that this inequality is in fact an equality.
                          Theorem 21 (Kolmogorov-Levin).
                                                          0(x, у) = C(x) + C(y I x) + О (log n)
                   for all strings x, у  of length at most n.
                           1This  is  the  first  non-trivial  statement  in  this  chapter,  and  probably  the  first  non-trivial 
                    result about Kolmogorov complexity; it was proven independently by Kolmogorov and Levin and 
                    published in [79,  225].
