               PROOF.  Since we already have one inequality, we need to prove only that 
                                C(x,y) ^ C(x) + C(y\x) + O(logn)
           for all X and y of length at most n.
               Let  X  and  y  be some  strings  of length  at  most  n.  Let  a  be  the  complexity 
           C(x, y) of the pair (x, y).  Consider the set A of all pairs whose complexity does not 
           exceed a.  Then A is a set of cardinality 0(2°)  (in fact, at most 2a+1) and (x, y) is 
           one of its elements.
               For each string t consider the  “vertical section”  At of A:
                                       At = {и I  (t,u) € A)
           (see  Figure  2).  The  sum  of the  cardinalities  of all  At  (over  all  strings  t)  is  the 
           cardinality of A and does not exceed 0(2a).  Therefore there are few “large” sections 
           At, and this is the basic argument we need for the proof.
               Let m be equal to  |_log2 |Âe|J  where x is the first component of the pair (x,y) 
           we started with.  In other words, assume that cardinality of Ax is between 2m and 
           2m+1.  Let us prove that
               (1)  C(y |x) does not exceed m significantly;
               (2)  C(x) does not exceed a — m significantly.
               We start with (1).  Knowing a, we can enumerate the set A.  If we know also x, 
           we can select  only pairs whose first component equals x.  In this way we get an 
           enumeration of Ax.  To specify y, it is enough to determine the ordinal number of у 
           in this enumeration (of Ax).  This ordinal number takes m + 0(l) bits, and together 
           with a we get m + O(logn) bits for the conditional description of у given x.  Note 
           that a = C(x,y) does not exceed 0(n) for strings x and у of length n.  Therefore, 
           we need only O(logn) to specify a and n, and
                                      C(y |x) < m + O(logn).
               Now let us prove (2).  Consider the set В of all strings t such that the cardinality 
           of At is at least 2771.  The cardinality of В does not exceed 2a+1/2m; otherwise, the 
           sum \A\ =    \At\  would be greater than 2a+1.  We can enumerate В if we know a 
           and m.  Indeed, we should enumerate A and group together the pairs with the same 
           first coordinate.  If we find 2m pairs with the same value of the first coordinate, we 
           put this value into B.  Therefore, the string x (as well as every element of В) can 
           be specified by (a — m) + O(logn) bits:  a — m + 1 bits are needed for the ordinal
