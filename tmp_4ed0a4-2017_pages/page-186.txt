        given statement of size n is provable in some fixed formal theory) has this form, we 
        can follow Chaitin and call Q  “the number of wisdom”  that contains information 
        about many important things.  (Sounds rather romantic, indeed.)
          Returning to more meaningful statements, we have proven that Q, is Turing- 
       equivalent to O'  (we can compute ft having an oracle for halting problem, and vice 
       versa).
                    5.8.  Effective Hausdorff dimension
          The notion of Hausdorff dimension is well known in measure theory  (and it 
       became popular in connection with fractals).  Here is the definition.  Let a > 0 be 
       some real number.  We say that a set A is an а-null set if for any e > 0 there exists 
       a sequence of intervals A that cover A such that
                                  < £■
       This definition assumes that A is a subset of a space where a class of subsets called 
        “intervals”  is chosen and the measure of intervals is defined.  We restrict ourselves 
       to  the  case  of the set  fl.  Here intervals  are the sets  £lx  (where  Q,x  is  the set  of 
       all infinite extensions of a binary string x).  The measure of the interval Q,x equals 
       2-i(x)%
          Let us start with a few simple remarks:
          (1)  Any subset of an a-null set is an a-null set.
          (2) For a = 1 we get the standard definition of a null set (set of measure zero).
          (3) For a > 1 any subset А С П is an a-null set.  Indeed, one can cover A by 2n 
       intervals that correspond to 2n strings of length n, and the sum of their a-measures 
       tends to 0 as n —> oo.
          (4)  Assume that 0 < a < a'.  Any a-null set is then an a'-null set  (note that 
       measure /i(I) of each interval / does not exceed 1 and therefore ß(I)a  ^ ß(I)a).
          166   Give a natural definition for an а-null set of reals, and show that a set 
       A  C  [0,1]  is  an  a-null  set  if and  only  if the  set  of binary  representations  of all 
       numbers in A is an а-null set according to the definition above.
          (Hint:  We need to verify that the more liberal notion of an interval in M where 
       we do not require any alignment, does not change the class of null sets.)
          Our remarks imply that for any set А С П there exists some threshold d £ [0,1] 
       with the following property:  if a  >  d,  the set  A  is  an a-null set;  if a  <  d,  it  is 
       not.  (For a — d the set may be an a-null set or not.)  This threshold is called the 
       Hausdorff dimension of the set A.
          167   The  Cantor set  is  the subset  of [0,1]  that  remains  if we  take out  the 
       middle third (1/3, 2/3), then take out the middle thirds of two remaining segments 
       (i.e.,  (1/9, 2/9)  out  of [0,1/3]  and  (7/9,8/9)  out of [2/3,1],  etc.).  Prove that the 
       Cantor set is a compact set homeomorphic to ft and has Hausdorff dimension log3 2.
          (Hint:  To get an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension, one may consider 
       the standard intervals, i.e., the intervals that remain after several steps of the Cantor 
       set construction.  To get a lower bound, note that  (1) we may consider only finite 
       covers due to compactness;  (2) if a cover for the Cantor set is given, we can look 
       at its parts that cover the left third and the right third; each of these parts can be 
       scaled to the cover of the entire set due to the self-similarity of the Cantor set.  If
