                                  14.4.  HYPOTHESES  OF  RESTRICTED  TYPE                  439
                 (1)  The family A is enumerable.  This means that there exists an algorithm 
            that prints elements of A as lists, with some separators (saying where one element 
            of A ends and another one begins).
                (2)  For every n the family A contains the set Bn of all n-bit strings.
                (3) The exists some polynomial p with the following property:  for every A G A, 
            for every natural n, and for every natural c < #A the set of all n-bit strings in A 
            can be covered by at most p(n) ■ фА/с sets of cardinality at most c from A.
                For a string x we denote by      the set of pairs  (i,j)  such that x has  (i * j)~ 
            description  that belongs  to A.  The set    is  a subset  of Px  defined  earlier;  the 
            bigger A is, the bigger is P^.  The full set Px is P^  for the family A that contains 
            all finite sets.
                Assume that the family A has properties (l)-(3).  Then for every string x the 
            set P£ has properties close to the properties of Px proved earlier.  Namely, for every 
            string x of length n the following is true:
                   •  The set P^ contains a pair that is 0(logn)-close to (0,n).  Indeed, prop­
                     erty  (2)  guarantees  that  the  family  A  contains  the  set  Bn  that  is  an 
                      (O(logn) * n)-description of x.
                   •  The set P^ contains a pair that is 0(l)-close to  (C(æ),0).  Indeed, con­
                     dition  (3)  applied to c = 1 and A = Bn says that every singleton belongs 
                     to A, therefore each string has a ((C(x) + 0(1)) * 0)-description.
                   •  The adaptation of Theorem 252 is true:  if (i.j)  G P^, then
                                      (г + к + O(logn), j — к) e P
                     for every к ^ j.  (Recall that n is the length of x.)  Indeed, assume that 
                     x has an  (i * j)-description A G A.  For a given к we enumerate A until 
                     we find a family of p(n)2k sets of size 2~кфА  (or less)  in A that covers 
                     all  strings  of length n  in  A.  Such  a family  exists  due  to  (3),  and p  is 
                     the polynomial from  (3).  The complexity of the set  that  covers x does 
                     not  exceed  г + к + 0(logn + log A:),  since this  set  is  determined  by  A, 
                     n,  к  and  the  ordinal  number  of the  set  in  the  cover.  We  may  assume 
                     without loss of generality that  к  ^ n,  otherwise  {x}  can be used as an 
                     ((г + к + O(logn)) * (j — A;))-description of x.  So the term 0(log k) can be 
                     omitted.
                Example.  Consider  the  family  A  formed  by  all  balls  in  Hamming’s  sense, 
            i.e.,  the  sets  By^r  — {x  |  l(x) — l(y),d(x,y)  <  r}  (here  l(u)  is  the  length  of 
            binary string и and d(x, y) is the Hamming distance between two strings x and у 
            of the same length).  The parameter r is called the radius of the ball and у is its 
            center.  Informally speaking, this means that the experimental data were obtained 
            by changing at most r bits in some string у (and all possible changes are equally 
            probable).  This  assumption  could  be reasonable  if some string у  is sent  via an 
            unreliable channel.  Both parameters у and r are not known to us in advance.
                 356  Prove  that  for  r  ^  n  the  set  ®n  of n-bit  strings  can  be  covered  by 
            poly(n)2n/V Hamming balls of radius r, where N stands for the cardinality of such 
            a ball (i.e.,V = l+n+•■•+ (;)).
                (Hint:  Consider  N  balls  of radius  r  whose  centers  are  randomly  chosen  in 
            Bn.  For a given x,  the probability of not  being covered  by  any of them equals 
            (1 — V/2n)N < e~VJV/2".  For N = n In 2 • 2n/V this upper bound is 2~n, so for this 
            N the probability of leaving some x uncovered is less than 1.)
