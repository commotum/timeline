                   Four algorithmic faces of randomness
                                     V.  U spensky
                 This appendix is a translation of the brochure “Four algorithmic 
                 faces of randomness”  (2nd corrected edition, MCCME Publish­
                 ers,  Moscow, 2009; the first edition was published in 2006) that 
                 is  based  on  a  lecture  delivered  by  Uspensky  during  the  sum­
                 mer school  “Modern Mathematics”  (Dubna near Moscow, Rus­
                 sia,  July  23,  2005).  The terminology used in this brochure1  is 
                 somewhat different  from that  used in the rest  of the book;  in 
                 particular, the terms chaotic, typical, and unpredictable are used 
                 to stress specific properties of random objects that appear in the 
                 corresponding definition.  Chaoticness means that the complex­
                 ity is high  (no regularities can be used to give a short descrip­
                 tion);  typicalness  is  based on measure theory;  unpredictability 
                 guarantees that no strategy can win in a prediction game against 
                 this  sequence.  There  are rigorous definitions for  these notions 
                 that can be considered possible definitions of true randomness. 
                 And it is remarkable that natural definitions of chaoticness and 
                 typicalness turn out to be equivalent (Levin-Schnorr theorem).
                                     Introduction
             If somebody tells us that  she tossed  a  “fair”  coin  twenty times  and got  the 
          string
          (I)                     10001011101111010000 
          (where 0 and 1 denote head and tail), or the string
          (II)                   01111011001101110001,
          this would not surprise us.  However, if somebody claims to obtain
          (III)                  00000000000000000000 
          or
          (IV)                   01010101010101010101,
          we start to doubt that the experiment was really performed in a proper way.  But 
          why?
             1The same terminology was  approved  by  Kolmogorov and  used  in  the  opening  talk  “Al­
          gorithms  and  randomness”  at  the  First  World  Congress  of the  Bernoulli  Society  (written  by 
          Kolmogorov and Uspensky, delivered by Uspensky), and in [84,  208,  194,  139]
