                                 •  A minimal complexity of a program that, given n, computes xq - • ■ xn-i. 
                                    We can also consider a program that computes xv for input n, which gives 
                                    the same (up to 0(1)) complexity.  We denote this complexity by C(x).
                                 •  A minimal complexity of a program that, given n, computes xq ■ ■ ■ xn for 
                                    all sufficiently large n.  For other n (finitely many of them) this program 
                                    may provide a wrong answer or never terminate.  Complexity defined in 
                                    this way is denoted by C00(x).
                                 •  max{0(x'o • • -x’n_i |n) | n — 0,1,...}, denoted by M(x).
                                 •  limsup,,^^ C(x0 ■ ■ ■ xn_i I n), denoted by Moc(x).
                           There are evident relations between the notions
                                                                      iliooty) ^ M(x) < C(x)
                     (up to 0(1) additive term) and
                                                                     Moo{x) ^ О00(.т) < C(x)
                     (with the same precision).
                             50  Prove that there exists a computable bit sequence x such that Оoc{x) is
                    much less than M(x) (and, therefore, much less than C(x)).  More precisely, there 
                    exists a sequence xm of computable sequences such that C00(xm) — О (login) and 
                    M(xm) ^ m.
                            (Hint:  Consider the sequence xm  = ym000 • ■ •, where ym  is the lexicograph­
                    ically  first  string of length m that  has conditional complexity  (given m)  at  least
                             51  Prove that for some computable sequence x the value of M(x)  is much
                    less than C(x).  More precisely, there exist a sequence xm of computable sequences 
                    such that M(xm) = O(logm) and C(xm) ^ m.
                           (Hint :  Consider the sequence xm — (lßß(m^000 • • • ), where the number of ones 
                    before trailing zeros equals BB(m), defined on p. 24.)
                             52  Prove that Coo(x) ^ 2M00(x) + 0(1).
                           (Hint:  Use the same argument as in Problem 48.)
                           In fact, the constant 2 in the preceding problem is optimal, as shown in [52].
                             53 Consider strings of length n that have complexity at least n (incompressible 
                    strings).
                           (a) Prove that the number of incompressible strings of length n is between 2n~c 
                    and 2n — 2n~c (for some c and for all n).
                           (b)  Prove that the cardinality of the set of incompressible strings of length n 
                    has complexity n — 0(1) (note that this implies the statement (a)).
                           (c)  Prove that  if a string x of length 2n is incompressible,  then its halves xq 
                    and xq  (of length n) have complexity n — 0(1).
                           (d)  Prove  that  if  a  string  x  of length  n  is  incompressible,  then  each  of its 
                    substrings of length к has complexity at least к — О (log n).
                           (e)  Prove that for any constant c <  1 all incompressible strings of sufficiently 
                    large length n contain a substring of \clog2 n\  zeros.
                           (Hints:  (a) There is at most 2n — 1 descriptions of length less than n, and part 
                    of them is used for shorter strings:  Any string of length n — d  (for some d)  has 
                    complexity less than n.  This gives a lower bound for the number of incompressible
