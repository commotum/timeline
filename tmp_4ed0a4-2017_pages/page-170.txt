                                            5.  MONOTONE COMPLEXITY
              156
              of smaller lengths increases cardinality only by an 0(l)-factor.  This implies the 
             statement of Theorem 99.                                                                 □
                   151  Give another proof of this result using the following simple observation:
             the A;-bit prefix of a given sequence can be considered as a binary notation of some 
              integer N (we add 1 at the beginning of the prefix not to lose leading zeros), and 
              N bits following this prefix are enough to reconstruct all к + N bits.
                   152  Prove that the statement of Theorem 99 is true not only for some c but
             for every c (including the negative ones).
                  (Hint:  If the series             diverges,  we  can  increase  a bit  the  function  /
             keeping this property:  there exists a function g such that g(n) — f(n)  —>  oo and 
             £ 2~s(n) = oo.)
                   153 Show that the statement of Theorem 99 (the conditional complexity ver­
             sion) remains true if we replace the logarithm by an arbitrary computable function 
             /  such that the series             diverges.
                  Martin-Löf claims in [117] that the same generalization is possible for uncon­
             ditional complexity (and refers to an unpublished paper for the proof).  The same 
             statement (attributed to Martin-Löf) can be found also in [225].  (We do not know 
             how to prove it.)
                  Let us mention also that the statement of Theorem 95 has a slightly different 
             form in [117]:
                   154 Prove that if a sequence ш is ML-random with respect to the uniform
             measure and / : N —> N is a computable total function such that the series ^  2“^ n* 
             computably converges, then С((ш)п \ n) ^ n — f(n) for all sufficiently large n.
                  (Hint:  If a series computably converges,  and the inequality is false infinitely 
             many times, the tails of the series can be used to get covers that have small mea­
             sure.)
                  Another natural question follows:  What happens if we require high complexity 
             not for all (sufficiently long) prefixes but for infinitely many of them?  In the same 
             Martin-Löf paper [117] the following results are stated:
                   155  Prove  that  for  almost  all  (with  respect  to  the  uniform  measure)  se­
             quences и; € Cl there exists c such that C((cv)n \ n) ^ n — c for infinitely many n.
                  (Hint:  If it is not the case, then for every c there exists N such that an n-bit 
             prefix of u> has complexity less than n — c for every n > N.  For given c and N the 
             set  of all u) with this property has measure at most 2~c.  As N increases, this set 
             increases, and the union over all N has measure at most 2~c by continuity.)
                   156  If for a given sequence u> there exists c such that С((ш)п \ n) ^ n — c for 
             infinitely many n, then u> is ML-random with respect to the uniform measure.
                  (Hint:  If u)  is covered by some interval in a family of total measure less than 
             2~c, then every sufficiently long prefix of ш can be described (when length is given) 
             by its ordinal number in the set of all strings of this length covered by some interval, 
             and this requires 2 log c + n — c bits.)
                  1157 I Prove  that  the  statement  of the  previous  problem  remains  true  if we 
             replace conditional complexity С((ш)п\п) by unconditional complexity С((ш)п). 
                  (Hint:  Use Problem 6 or, better, Problem 55.)
