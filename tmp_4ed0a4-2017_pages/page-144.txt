               130                               5.  MONOTONE COMPLEXITY
                     133          Prove that the monotone complexity of an infinite sequence (defined in 
               a natural way) is the limit of the increasing sequence of monotone complexities of 
               its prefixes.
                    Theorem 84.  There exists an optimal decompressor,  i.e.,  a computable map­
               ping D \  E  —>  E  such  that KM p  is  minimal up  to  an  additive  constant:  for any 
               computable D' : E —> E  there exists a constant c such that
                                                  KMd{%) ^ KMd'(x) -+■ c
               for every string x.
                    Proof.  Let U be the set of triples whose sections are the lower graphs of all 
               computable mappings (constructed in Theorem 83, p. 129).  Let Dn be a computable 
               mapping that has lower graph Un.  Then let us define a mapping D as
                                                        D(nz) = Dn(z),
               where n is the prefix-free encoding of the number n (say, its binary representation 
               with doubled digits followed by 01)  and 2 is an arbitrary element of E.  In terms 
               of the  lower  graph,  consider  the set  of all  pairs  (nu,v)  such  that  (n,u,v)  €  U. 
               It  is  easy  to  check  that  we  indeed  get  a  computable  mapping.  If some  (mono­
               tone) decompressor D' has number n (i.e., its lower graph coincides with Un), then 
               КМр(х) < KMd'(x) + l(n) for every x.                                                               □
                    As usual, we fix some optimal monotone decompressor (description mode), i.e., 
               some computable mapping D that satisfies the statement of this theorem, and define 
               monotone complexity of a string x as KMd(x).  We use the notation KM(x) (the 
               subscript D is omitted).
                    (Warning:  Sometimes the notation KM{x) is used for the a priori complexity. 
               Usually in this case the monotone complexity is denoted by Km,  as in  [103],  or
               K m .)
                    Theorem 85.  (a) Monotone complexity is a monotone function, i.e.,
                                                 KM(x) ^ KM(y) if x^y\
                    (b)  the function KM is upper semicomputable\
                    (c)  KM{x) <J(x) + 0(l);
                    (d)  KM(x) ^ K(x) + 0(1);
                    (e)  К A (x) ^ KM(x) + 0( 1);
                    (f)  an infinite sequence of zeros and ones is computable if and only if the mono­
               tone complexity of its prefixes is bounded;
                    (g)  if f  ■  T,  -ï  Y,  is  a  computable  mapping,  then KM(f(x))  < KM(x) + 0(1) 
               (the constant hidden in 0 (1)  may depend on f  but not on æ);
                    (h)  if f  :  E  —>  Nj_  is  a  computable  mapping,  then K(f(x))  ^  KM(x) + 0(1) 
               (the constant hidden in 0 (1)  may depend on f  but not on x).
                    It is instructive to compare these statements with the properties of the a priori 
               complexity given in Theorem 79 (p. 122).  Since monotone complexity is not smaller 
               than the a priori complexity (statement  (e)), some properties of the a priori com­
               plexity are automatically valid for monotone complexity.  In particular, we conclude 
               immediately that K(x \ l(x)) ^ KM(x)+0(l) and K(x) ^ KM(x)+K(l(x))+0( 1). 
               Note also that for computable sequences of incomparable strings (none is a prefix
