               308             9.  FREQUENCY AND GAME APPROACHES TO RANDOMNESS
                    (c)  There exists a Mises-Kolmogorov-Loveland random sequence with frequency 
               1/2 such that some Kolmogorov-Loveland admissible (and even Church admissible) 
               rule selects from it a subsequence that is not Mises-Kolmogorov-Loveland random.
                    (d)  There  exists  a  Mises-Church-Daley random sequence  with frequency 1/2 
               that becomes not Mises-Church random after a computable permutation of its terms.
                    P r o o f,  (a)  Consider  a  computable  sequence  of rational  numbers  that  con­
               verges to 1/2 very slowly, for example,
                                                              1        1
                                                       Pi    ~ 2 ”   JT+ Î
               (here 5 is added to make all pi positive).  Consider the computable measure p that 
               corresponds to independent trials with success probabilities p*.
                    Since the series XXp* — 1/2)2 diverges, no ML-random sequence (with respect 
               to ft)  is ML-random with respect to the uniform measure (Theorem 197).  On the 
               other hand, all these sequences are Mises-Kolmogorov-Loveland random with limit 
               frequency 1/2 (Theorem 202).
                    (b) This statement can be proved in a similar way, but one should consider the 
               sequence pi that converges to 1/2 even more slowly.  For example, let
                                                        _  1          1
                                                     Рг       2 log(i + 5) '
               What is the probability (according to ft) of the event  “n-bit prefix contains fewer 
               zeros than ones”  (the frequency of ones exceeds 1/2)?  Theorem 198 says that this 
               probability (let us denote it by 6n) is bounded by e“n/°(log                  (the threshold d is 
               about n/0(logn), and d2/4n = n/O(log2n)).  The series                           converges, so the
               probability of the event  “all prefixes of length at least N contain at least as many 
               zeros as ones”  is positive.  The set of positive measure  (obviously)  contains some 
               ML-random (with respect to ft) sequence.  Now we know that there exists an ML- 
               random sequence (with respect to ft) where all prefixes of length at least N have at 
               least as many zeros as ones.  This sequence is Mises-Kolmogorov-Loveland random 
               (Theorem 202).  Adding jV+1 zeros before it, we get a Mises-Kolmogorov-Loveland 
               sequence with the required property.
                    (c)  As W.  Merkle has noted,  here we can use the same trick to generate the 
               required sequence.  However, the sequence Pi should be chosen in a more compli­
               cated way.  Let  us split  the  sequence into  blocks:  the  kth  block  consists  of one 
               term,  where probability  (to be  1)  equals  1/2,  and two  parts  of equal  (and  large 
               enough) length Пк.  In the first part the probabilities of 1 are the same and exceed 
               1/2 slightly, while in the second part they are slightly less than 1/2 (and again the 
               same);  see Figure  28.  Here Ek  is strictly positive and converges to 0 as  к  —>  oo,
                                                   Пк                              Пк
