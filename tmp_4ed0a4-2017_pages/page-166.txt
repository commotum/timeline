               {i.e.,  there  exists c such that for every n  the inequality C((uj)n \ ri)  ^ n — f(n) — c 
               holds).
                    P r o o f.  Assume  that  the  claim  is  false.  This  means  that  for  every  c  there 
               exists an n such that
                                                C((uj)n\n) < n - f(n) -  c.
               In other words, for every c the sequence uj is covered by some interval Qx such that
                                                  C(x I n)  < n — f(n) — c,
               where n is the length of x.  For each n there are at most 2n~^n^~c intervals with 
               this  property and their total measure is at most  2~^n^2~c  (for a given n).  The 
               total measure of all such intervals (for all n) is
               and the sequence uj forms an effectively null set:  choosing an appropriate c, we get 
               a cover for uj  that has small measure.  Therefore, uj  is not ML-random.  (Note that 
               the sum of the series         2"^n)  may be a non-computable real number;  this does 
               not matter since we may use any upper bound for it.)                                             □
                    Remark.  In the proof we used only that / is upper semicomputable, so the 
               statement remains true for f(n) = K(n):  for every ML-random sequence uj  (with 
               respect to the uniform measure) we have
                                              C((cj)n \n)  ^  n -  K{n) -  0(1).
               As we will see in Theorem 98, this is a necessary and sufficient condition.
                    Theorem  95  implies,  for  example,  that  for  any  ML-random  sequence  (with 
               respect to the uniform measure) the plain complexity of its prefix of length n is at 
               least n — 2 log n — О ( 1 ) and even n — log n — 2 log log n — О ( 1 ), since the corresponding 
              series converge.
                    Making function / smaller, we make the claim of the theorem stronger.  It turns 
               out that for some / we get a randomness criterion in this way:
                    Theorem  96.  There  exists  a  total  computable function f:  N —» N  such  that 
               ^2n          <  oo  and having the following property:  if for some sequence uj  and for
               some c the inequality
                                                 C((uj)n\n)  ^  n -  f{n) -  c 
               holds for all n,  then uj  is ML-random with respect to the uniform measure.
                    PROOF.  We need to prove that every non-random sequence (i.e., every sequence 
              that belongs to the largest effectively null set) has simple prefixes.  Note that we 
              also need to choose the function /.
                   To explain how to do this, let us assume that we are given a family of intervals 
              with total measure at most e.  Let F be the set of strings that define these intervals 
               (i.e.,  the  family  consists  of intervals  flx  for  all  x  £  F).   Let  us  sort  strings  in 
              F  according to their length and for each length n  consider the total measure of 
              intervals that correspond to n-bit strings in F.  Let it be approximately equal to 
                       (we assume that / has integer values, so this cannot be done exactly, but 
              can be done up to factor 2 in both directions; for simplicity we ignore this bounded 
              factor in the sequel).  Then we have                        ^  £■  On the other hand,  the set
