                2.  COMPLEXITY OF  PAIRS  AND  CONDITIONAL COMPLEXITY
        36
           [Hint:  Let us enumerate all programs of complexity less than n defined on all 
        n-bit strings, and maintain two n-bit strings x and y with the following property: 
        none of the  programs  found  maps  y  to  x.  When  a new program  is  found  that 
        maps y to x, we choose a fresh value of y and then choose an appropriate x.  This 
        process is effective if n (=length of y) is given, it defines a partial function у н-» x, 
        so C(x\y) = 0(1) for every pair selected.)
           31 Let x and у be bit strings such that  CT(x\y)  ^  n and  CT(y\x)  < n. 
        Prove that there exists a program of a computable permutation of the set of bit 
        strings that maps x to у and has complexity at most 2n + 0(1).
           (Hint:  It  is  easy  to  construct  a string v  of length 2n + 0(1)  that  encodes  a 
        pair  of total  programs  /   that  maps  x  to  у  and  g  that  maps  y  to  x.  We  may 
        assume without loss of generality that x and y have 0 as their first bits.  Consider 
        a binary relation R on the set of strings that have first bit 0, defined as R(u, v)  : 
        ( f(u) — v) and (g(v) = и)). This is a decidable one-to-one correspondence between 
        decidable sets of strings with infinite complements, and it can be easily extended 
        to a computable permutation.)
           32  Show that the upper bound in the preceding problem cannot be improved 
        significantly:  for  every к there are two strings x  and у  of length n — 2k + 0(1) 
        such that C(x),C(y) ^ к + 0(1)  (and therefore  CT(x\y), CT(y\x)  ^ к + 0(1)), 
        but every permutation of n-bit strings that maps x to у has complexity at least 2k.
          (Hint:  Let  us first  select  (arbitrarily)  2k  strings  у  and  pair  them with some 
        string x.  Let  us  enumerate  computable  permutations  of n-bit  strings  that  have 
        complexity less than 2k.  If and when all selected pairs are served by some of these 
        permutations,  choose a new string x that is connected (by existing permutation) 
        with at most half of the selected y-strings.  After that Q,(2k) new permutations are 
        needed to connect new x to all y-strings.  Therefore at most  22k/Q(2k) — 0(2k) 
        x-strings will be used, so the final x and у have complexity at most к + 0(1).  The 
        selection of x connected with at most half of selected y-strings is always possible, 
        since each of the у-strings is connected with a small fraction of x-strings,  and we 
        can change the order of summation in the double sum.  Note that this argument 
        may be used to guarantee that one of the strings x and у belongs to a given set of 
        2k strings.)
          See [136] for the detailed proofs of these results about total conditional com­
        plexity.
          Many properties  of unconditional  complexity  have  conditional  counterparts 
        with essentially the same proofs.  Here are some of these counterparts.
            •  Function C(-1 •) is upper semicomputable (this means that the set of triples 
              (x,y,n) such that C(x\y) < n is enumerable).
            •  For any у and n the set of all strings x such that C(x \y) < n has cardi­
              nality less then 2n.
            •  For any у and n there exists a string x of length n such that C(x \y) ^ n.
           33  Prove that for any strings у and 2 and for any number n there exists a 
        string x of length n such that C(x \ y) ^ n — 1 and C(x \z) ^ n — 1.
          (Hint:  Both requirements are violated by a minority of strings.)
