                            13.5.  PROOF  OF  A  SIMILAR RESULT  VIA  KRIPKE  MODELS            413
                 Theorem  245.  Let Ф(£ь..., tm) be a propositional formula with connectives 
             Л, V, —» that is not provable in IPC.  Then there exists a number k,  propositional 
             formulas Ti,..., Tm using new variables si,..., s^  with connectives A  and V,  and 
             a critical implication J(s\,..., Sk) such that the formula
                                              *{Tu ...,Tm) ^ J
             is provable in IPC.
                 Note that formulas Ti do not use implication.
                 This result  (due to Yu. T. Medvedev) belongs to logic and proof theory, so we 
             do not include its proof in our book.  Interested readers may refer to the paper [42] 
             where the proof is given.  This statement will be used in the proof of Theorem 238.
                 P r o o f.  Let  Ф(t\,... ,tm)  be  a formula which  is  not  provable  in  IPC.  The­
             orem  245  guarantees  that  there  exist  a number  к  and  formulas T\,..., Tm  with 
             variables s\,..., Sk and a critical implication J(si,..., st) such that the formula
                                              Ф(ТЬ ..., Tm) —> J
             is provable in IPC.
                 Let us take к independent random strings щ,..., Uk of length n/c (the constant 
             c will be chosen later).  Let us substitute corresponding к singletons for variables 
             in T\...., Tm and denote the resulting non-empty sets by Xi,..., Xm.  Those sets 
             are finite,  since  formulas Ti  in Theorem  245  do not  contain  implication.  As the 
             implication Ф(Ть ... ,Tm) —> J is provable in IPC, the complexity of the problem
                                       Ф(ХЬ..., Xm) —> JK ,..., Uk)
             is  0(1).  By Theorem 244 the complexity of the problem J(wi,... ,Uk) is at least 
             n/c — 0(1).  Therefore,  the complexity of the problem Ф(Хь..., Xm)  is at least 
             n/c — 0(1), too.  This bound exceeds n/(2c) for all sufficiently large n.
                 Now we need to choose c in such a way that all the elements in Xi,..., Xm are 
            strings of length at most n.  Recall that every element of Xi,... ,ХШ is obtained 
             from singletons щ,..., ut by a fixed number of conjunctions and disjunctions.  This 
             means that we use pairing operations 0(1) times (starting from variables and tags 
             0,  1).  If we choose a pairing function in a natural way, it does not increase the size 
            of strings more than linearly,  so  an 0(l)-iteration of pairing operations will give 
            only a linear increase in size,  and for suitable  c we get  strings of length at most
             n.  It remains to note that the statement of the theorem is invariant and does not 
            depend on the choice of the pairing function.                                       □
                 Historical remark.  Theorem 242 is taken from [182].  Theorem 244 is due to 
            A. Chernov [38].
               13.5.  Proof of a result similar to Theorem 238 using Kripke models
                 In the proof of Theorem 238, we used the statement of Theorem 245 (without 
            proof).  Muchnik showed that a similar statement can be proved directly using only 
            the completeness theorem for Kripke models and IPC.
                 Theorem  246.  Let Ф(ti,...,tk)  be a propositional formula with connectives 
             Л, V, —>  not provable in IPC.  Then for every n  there exist problems X ”, ..., X£ 
             of complexity 0(n) such that the complexity of Ф(Х”,..., X£) is at least n for all 
             sufficiently large n.
