                    4.7.  CONDITIONAL  PREFIX  COMPLEXITY  AND  COMPLEXITY  OF PAIRS     113
            since the difference between complexities of two numbers is bounded by the prefix 
            complexity of the difference between numbers.  On the other hand,  we can write 
            the formula for K(x) — C(x) for K(x) in place of x; in this way we get the equation
                                   K{K{x)) - C(K(x)) = 0{K^(x)).
            So all four versions of complexity of x (combinations of plain and prefix complexity) 
            differ at most by 0(K^3\x)).  In particular,
                                   K(K(x)) - C(C(x)) = 0(K{3\x)).
            It  remains to  show that  0{K^3\x))  and 0(C^3\x))  is the same precision.  Note 
            that \u — v\ = 0(K(u)) implies |K(u) — K(v)\ — 0(\ogK(u)), so K(K(K(x))) and 
            K(C(C(x))) are “logarithmically close”  (we say that a is logarithmically close to b 
            if \a — b\ — O(loga)).  This  “closeness”  relation is symmetric and transitive (if we 
            allow the constant to increase in О-notation).  Now note that C(v)  and K(v)  are 
            logarithmically close for every v, in particular, for v = C(C(x)), and the transitivity 
            shows that K(K(K(x))) and C(C(C(x))) are also logarithmically close, so indeed 
            0(K(3\x)) and 0(C^(x)) is the same precision.
                In this way we obtained another result of Solovay from [188]:
                Theorem 74.
                                 K(x) = C(x) + C(C(x)) + 0(C(3)(x)).
                In other words, the inequality from Theorem 65 (p. 102) is almost an equality.
                 117 Give a direct proof of the inequality
                               C(x) < K(x) - K(K(x)) + K(3)(x) + 0(1)
            by estimating the number of x that make the right-hand side of the inequality small.
                (Hint:  We have seen in Theorem 64 (p. 101) that the logarithm of the number 
            of strings  such that  K(x)  <  n  is  bounded by n — K(n) + c for some  c and  for 
            all n.  Given n, we can enumerate these strings, and each string x of this type can 
            be reconstructed from n and the ordinal number of x in this enumeration.  This 
            ordinal number can be represented by a string и of length exactly n — K(n) + c 
            (add leading zeros to its binary representation).  Knowing this representation, we 
            know n — K(n) (the constant c is fixed), and to reconstruct n it is enough to encode 
            K(n)  by a self-delimiting description of length  K(K(n)).  Now concatenate this 
            self-delimiting description  and the string и:  we get  a  (plain)  description of x of 
            length  K(K(n)) + n — K(n) + c.  This can be done for arbitrary string x with 
            K(x) < n, in particular for all strings of prefix complexity exactly n.)
