            •  the number of strings x such that k(x) < n is 0 (2n) (plain complexity C, 
              Theorem 8, p. 19);
            •  the series Ylx 2~k^  converges (prefix complexity AT, Theorem 62, p. 100);
            •  every prefix-free set of strings x such that k(x)  < n has 0 (2") elements 
              (decision complexity KR, Theorem 127, p. 194);
            •  Y^xex 2~k^   <  1  for every prefix-free set  X  of binary strings  (a priori 
              complexity KA, Theorem 80, p. 126).
          This scheme gives the same four complexities with one important exception: 
        we get a priori complexity instead of monotone complexity.  (There is no problem 
        with prefix complexity, since it coincides with the negative logarithm of the discrete 
        a priori probability, the largest lower semicomputable semimeasure on N.)
          Combining these two quadrilaterals, we get a pentagon (Figure 19).

                        Figure 19.  Five complexities
          Let us recall the basic results that relate complexities in this pentagon.  First, 
        all  five  complexities  differ  at  most  by  O(logn)  for  strings  of length  n.  Indeed, 
        Theorem 65, p. 102 says that K{x) < C(x) + 0{\ogC{x)).  On the other hand,
                  C(x) < C(x\l(x)) + C(l(x)) < KR (x) + O(logn).
        So the two most distant complexities in the pentagon (the upper one and the lower 
        one) differ at most by O(logn) for strings of length n.
          A more complicated picture arises if we want to bound the difference between 
        two complexities in terms of the complexities, not their length (note that a com­
        plexity can be much less than length).  This is indeed possible for two lines that go 
        in the north-east directions:
                         K(x) ^ C(x) + 0(\ogC(x))
        (see Theorem 65) and
                       KM(x) < KR (x) + О (log KR (x))
        (Theorem 127).  (A similar inequality with KA  instead of KM follows, as we have 
        already mentioned in Problem 140, p.  144.)  For  “north-west”  lines the situation 
        is different:  KM and KR  are bounded for prefixes of a computable sequence (e.g., 
        for strings that contain only zeros) while C and К are not  (the string of n zeros 
        has the same complexity as the integer n, and this complexity is of order log n for 
        some n).  We have already discussed this question in Theorem 86 and noted that 
        the  difference  between  К  and  KM  can be of order  logn  in  both directions  (for 
        infinitely many n and for some x of length n).  Theorem 87 says that the difference
