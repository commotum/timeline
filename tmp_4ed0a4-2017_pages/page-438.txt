             Ignoring additive error terms of order O(logn)  (here and also further) we will as­
             sume that the complexity of the list is less than a.
                  Remove from the list all sets of cardinality more than 2a+l3.  The Kolmogorov 
             complexity of the resulting list is also less than a.  By construction it has at most 
             2a sets and each of them has at most 2a+@ elements.  Thus the union of all sets in 
             the list has less than 22a+l3 < 2n strings.  Hence there is a string of length n that 
             does not appear in any set from the list.  Let t be the lexicographically first such 
             string.  Its complexity is at most a, as it can be found given n and the list.
                  Let us show that this string (denoted by t in the sequel) is not (a, /3)-stochastic. 
             Indeed,  assume that it is contained in some set A of complexity at most a.  The 
             cardinality  of A  exceeds  2Q+/3  since  all  smaller  sets  were  taken  into  account  by 
             construction.  Therefore
                       d(t I A) — log #A -  C(t I A) > (a + ß) — C{t) > (a + ß) — a ^ ß
             (one should also add a reserve of size clogn to compensate for logarithmic terms 
             that we ignore).                                                                      □
                 In the other direction we have the following trivial bound:
                  Theorem 249.  If a + ß > n + O(logn),  all the strings of length n are (a,ß)- 
             stochastic.
                 P roof.  Indeed, we can split all n-bit strings into 2a sets of size 2^.          □
                 As we will see later, the reality is closer to this bound than to the bound of the 
             previous theorem.  See Problem 365 on p. 449.
                 It is natural to ask how often non-stochastic objects appear.  For example, what 
             is the fraction of non-stochastic objects among all n-bit strings?  It is immediately 
             clear that this fraction does not exceed 2"^:  Let A be the set of all n-bit strings, 
             and note that strings with deficiency ß or more form only a 2“^-fraction of A.
                 On the other hand, if 2a + ß       n, we can extend the reasoning used to prove 
             Theorem 248.  Namely,  for some h we consider all sets of complexity at most a 
             and cardinality at most 2a+@+h.  Then we take the first 2h elements not covered 
             by these sets; it is possible if 2a + ß + h < n.  The complexity of those elements is 
             bounded by a + /i, so its deficiency in any set of size greater than 2a+@+h exceeds ß. 
             These arguments (with 0(logn)-corrections needed) prove the following statement:
                 Theorem 250.  If2a + ß < n — O(logn),  then the fraction of n-bit strings that 
             are not (a, ß)-stochastic is at least 2 ~2a~P~°^ogn\
                 Instead of a fraction of non-stochastic strings (i.e., the probability of obtaining 
             such a string by tossing a fair coin), one can ask about their total a priori prob­
             ability  (i.e.,  the probability of obtaining such a string by a universal randomized 
             algorithm).  More formally, let m(x) be the discrete a priori probability of x as de­
             fined in Chapter 4:  m(:r) = 2~K(xï+°(1h  Then we consider the sum of m(:r) over 
             all x  of length n that  are not  (a, /5)-stochastic.  The following theorem estimates 
             this sum:
                 Theorem 251.  If2a + ß<n — O(logn)  and a < ß — O(logn),  then this sum 
             equals 2 ~a+° ^ n\
                 P roof.  We need to prove both lower and upper bounds for this sum.  The lower 
             bound easily follows from the proof of Theorem 248.  Indeed, a non-stochastic string
