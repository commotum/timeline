              possible without them.
                   The authors express their gratitude to all the people who helped them to pre­
              pare the Russian edition, especially Marina Feigelman who made a drawing for its 
              cover,  Olga Lehtonen who performed the cover design,  and Victor Shuvalov who 
              helped a lot with typesetting.
                   The authors were supported by the International Science Foundation  (Soros 
              foundation),  STINT  (Sweden),  Russian  Fund  for  Basic  Research  (01-01-00493-

                   The book was made possible by the generous support  of our colleagues,  in­
              cluding Bruno Bauwens, Laurent Bienvenu, Harry Buhrman,  Cris Calude, Bruno 
              Durand,  Péter  Gåcs,  Denis  Hirschfeldt,  Rupert  Hölzl,  Mathieu  Hoyrup,  Michal

                   We are thankful to American Mathematical Society (in particular, Sergei Gel- 
              fand) for the suggestion to submit the book for publication in their book program 
              and for the kind permission to keep the book available freely in electronic form at 
              our homepages.  We thank the (anonymous) referees for their attention and sugges­
              tions,  and Jennifer Wright Sharp for correcting our (numerous)  English language 
              errors.
                   For many years the authors had the privilege to work in a close professional and 
              personal contact with Andrej Muchnik (1958-2007), an outstanding mathematician, 
              a  deep  thinker,  and  an  admirable  person,  who  participated  in  the  work  of the 
              Kolmogorov seminar and inspired a lot of work done in this seminar.  We devote 
              this book to his memory.
