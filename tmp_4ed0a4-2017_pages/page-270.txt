                                                            8.6.    A  PROOF  OF  AN  INEQUALITY                                                   257
                    clog N in the right-hand side.  Then (as before) we add three inequalities of this 
                    type and apply the inequality for complexities.  Then we get
                    A"((x\, ■ • •             (î/i) • • • )Un)) (^i? ■ • ■ ) )
                                  < ]T (-log/(^,2/z)) + ^{-\ogg{yi,zi)) + Y^(-^h(xi,Zi)) + clog AT
                                        i                                  i                                i
                   for some constant c and for all N,  aq,..., x^, г/i,..., ум, z\,..., zpj.  (Note that 
                   the total length  of all  the strings Xi,yi,Zi  for г  =  1,..., N  is  O(N),  so  all  loga­
                   rithmic terms are absorbed by clogN.)  Combining this bound with the inequality 
                          2~K(U) ^ 1, we conclude that for every N the sum
                                                             ЕП f(xi,yi)g(yi, Zi)h(xi, Zi)
                    (over all tuples aq,... ,xn, г/i,... ,yw, z 1,... ,zpj) does not exceed 2°(logiV), i.e., it 
                   is bounded by a polynomial in N.  But this sum is the Nth power of the sum
                                                                  Z  f(x,y)g(y,z)h(x,z),
                                                          {x,y,z)(zXxY X Z
                   so  polynomial growth is possible only if the latter sum does not exceed  1.  This 
                   ends the proof.                                                                                                                  □
                           252               Show that this inequality implies the bound for the volume of a three- 
                   dimensional body in terms of its two-dimensional projections mentioned on p.  12.
                          (Hint:  We can let /, g, h be the characteristic functions of the projections.  This 
                   works for the discrete case; for the continuous case we should either approximate 
                   the body using a cubic grid or approximate the integral by finite sums.)
                          For comparison let us give two other proofs of the same inequality.  Here is the 
                   first one (rather simple) using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (u,v)2 < ||u,||2 • ||v||2, 
                   or, in coordinates,  Ç^UiVi)2 < (Y^ui)(J2vi )•  We can argue as follows:
                             Y  f(x,y)g(y,z)h{x,z)) ^ ( Y f 2(x'yï) ( Y ( Y 9^y'z^ x'z^) )
                            x,y,z                                 J          \x,y                /  \x,y  \  z                           J  /
                                                = (z/2(^))                                          fz^’^V
                                                     \ x,y               J  \y,z                J  \x,z                 J
                          Another proof uses Shannon entropy (and can be considered as a translation of 
                   the Kolmogorov complexity argument into probabilistic language).  Let us assume 
                   that        f 2 =        g2 =         h2 — 1.  We want to prove the inequality                               y z p(x> Viz) ^ 
                   1, where p(x, y, z) = f(x, y)g(y, z)h(x, z).  Assume that is not the case and this sum 
                   equals c > 1.  Then we can multiply it by 1/c and get a probability distribution p' 
                   on X X Y X Z\
                                                         P'{x,y,z) = \f(x,y)g(y,z)h(x,z).
                   The corresponding random variable (whose range is X x Y x Z) is denoted by £.  It 
                   can be considered as a triple of (dependent) random variables £x, £y, £z.  One can
