         154                5.  MONOTONE COMPLEXITY
            Finally,  there is a (trivial)  technical problem:  the statement requires /  to be 
         integer valued, so some rounding is needed.            □
            The two last theorems together provide a randomness criterion that uses plain 
         complexity  (and  not  monotone  or  prefix  complexity).  This  criterion  is  robust: 
         one can replace the conditional complexity C((oo)n\n)  by the unconditional one, 
         C((co)n), or by a conditional prefix complexity, K((co)n \n).
            Indeed,  each  of these  replacements  only  increases complexity,  therefore only 
         Theorem 96 needs to be verified.  For the prefix complexity version, we use that for 
         each element x G A the inequality K(x\A)  ^ log |>4| + 0(1) holds (we consider a 
         prefix-free encoding by strings of length log |A|).
           The case of unconditional plain complexity is a bit more difficult.  As we do 
         not know n, we need to describe a string x € Fc,n (here FCyTl is the set of all strings 
         x E Fc that have length n) by its ordinal number in the entire set Fc  (and not by 
         its ordinal number in FCjTl  as before).  Enumerating Fc in increasing length order, 
         we need
                          log(|FC)o| + |-Fc,i| + • • • + |Fc,n|) 
         bits for that,  and this bound is enough if the last term  |FCjTl|  is greater than the 
         sum of all preceding terms (in this case the increase is at most twofold).  We can 
         achieve this using the same trick as before:  we replace a string by all its extensions 
         of some bigger length.  Note that this is done separately for each c, so the condition 
         c remains, but this does not matter since it gives only O (loge) additional bits.
           So we get the following result:
           Theorem 97.  A sequence u)  is ML-random if and only if for any computable 
         total function f: N —>■ N such that ^ 2~^n) < oo the inequality
                            0 ((w)n) ^ n -  f(n) -  0 (1)
         holds.
           This criterion uses only plain unconditional complexity and is the most popular 
         version of the Miller-Yu theorem.
           This criterion has a drawback:  there is a quantifier over /.  It can be placed 
         differently (there exists some /  that rejects all the non-random sequences, as The­
         orem 96 says),  but still it  would be nice to get  rid of /   completely.  It  is indeed 
         possible, but the price is that we have to reinsert prefix complexity into the state­
         ment:
           Theorem 98.  A sequence cj is ML-random with respect to the uniform measure 
         if and only if
                           C({cv)n) ^ n -  K(n) -  0(1).
           Proof.  If J2n 2“^ n) converges for a computable /, then K(n) ^ f(n) + 0(1). 
        Therefore the condition with prefix complexity is stronger than that in Theorem 97, 
        and thus we need to prove only the converse implication:  if for every c there exists 
        an n such that
                            C((w)n) < n -  K(n) -  c,
        then u) is not ML-random.  This can be done in the same way as in Theorem 95. 
        We need only note that the set of all strings x such that
                            C{x) < l(x) -  K{l{x)) -  c
