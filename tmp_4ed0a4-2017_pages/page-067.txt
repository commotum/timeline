       52      2.  COMPLEXITY  OF PAIRS AND  CONDITIONAL  COMPLEXITY
          (.Hint:  Since I((x,y) :t\z)  = I(y:t\z) + I(x:t |y, z),  the left-hand side in this 
       equality is zero if and only if both terms in the right-hand side are zero;  and the 
       second term in the right-hand side does not change when the order of x, y, z, t is 
       reversed.)
