                                      6.3.  CONDITIONAL COMPLEXITIES                        201
                 200  Give a detailed proof of this theorem  (it follows the same scheme as in
            the case of plain or prefix conditional complexity).
                 In each of eight classes let us fix some optimal (a, ß) | 7-decompressor and denote 
            the  corresponding complexity by  K(Q,/3)|7.  In  this  notation  K(x\y)  (as  defined 
            earlier) is K ^ =) \ =  and C(x\y) is K(=,=) | = -
                 201  Show that by replacing = by x in place of 7 we may only increase the 
            complexity.
                 (Hint:  This replacement adds more restrictions for a decompressor, so we get 
            fewer decompressors.  For the same reasons the plain complexity does not exceed 
            the prefix one.)
                It would be interesting to studj' how large this increase could be (and establish 
            other properties of these conditional complexities).
                Let us give an example of a statement that involves conditional complexities 
            as they are defined above:
                 202 Prove that
                             C(x) < K(=.=) i *(* I y) + KR (у) + О (log KR (»)).
                Let  us  now  describe  one  more  approach  to  the  definition  of the  conditional 
            complexity that goes back to Kolmogorov’s interpretation of logical connectives as 
            operations on problems [76].  The conditional complexity of x when у is known can 
            be described as the complexity of the problem “transform у into ж” ; moreover, this 
            problem can be considered as a set of all functions that map у into x (each function 
            that maps у to ж is a “solution”  of this problem).
                More formally, let us consider the space F whose elements are all partial func­
            tions whose arguments and values are natural numbers.  Let us introduce the fol­
            lowing partial order on this set:  Д  ^ /2  if /2 is an extension of /1  (i.e., /i(y) = x 
            implies /г(у) = x).  By finite elements of F we mean functions with finite domain. 
            For each finite element  /   G  F consider its cone,  i.e.,  the set  of all its extensions 
            {y  I  /   ^  I/}  (both finite and infinite).  We call a continuous mapping T: Nx  —> F 
            computable if the set of pairs  (a, f)  such that  a  G  Nx,  /  is a finite element  of F 
            and /  ^ T(a), is enumerable.  Continuous computable mappings Nx —> F are used 
            as decompressors for functions.  For each function /  G F. we define the complexity 
            of /   (with respect  to  decompressor T)  as the minimal length of a string  (or the 
            logarithm of the number—recall that we identify strings with natural numbers) a 
            such that /  ^ T(a).
                 203  Prove that there exists an optimal decompressor (in this sense) and that 
            the complexity of the function y    x (whose domain is a singleton {y} and whose 
            value is x) is C(x\y) + 0(1).
                We can give a similar interpretation of all eight conditional complexities defined 
            above:  for  every  two  spaces  Y, X  G  {Nx, £},  we  define  the  space  of functions 
            (У  —> X)  and  then  consider  computable  mappings  of the space  of descriptions 
            P  G  {Nx,£}  into  the function space  (Y  —> X).  The definition  of the function 
            space is given in the spirit of Scott domain theory  (or the theory of /о-spaces in 
            the sense of Ershov, see [176] for details).
                A slightly different interpretation of (plain) conditional complexity as the com­
            plexity of the problem “transform y to ж”  is considered in Chapter 13; it does not 
            use computability notions for function spaces.
