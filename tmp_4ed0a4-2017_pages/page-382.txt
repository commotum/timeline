        elements, the set E(T)  of all neighbors of all elements in T has more elements than 
        T itself.
          PROOF.  Let  us  prove  that  a random  graph  has  this  property  with  positive 
        probability.  Speaking about random graph, we mean that for every left vertex we 
        randomly select a+m+2 neighbors on the right.  This choice is made independently 
        (for different points and for different neighbors, so some neighbors of a given vertex 
        may coincide, and we actually get fewer than a + m + 2 neighbors).
          What does it mean that the property stated in the lemma is false?  In this case 
        we have some non-empty subset T of the left part and some subset U of the right 
        part, such that \U\ — |T|, but all neighbors of T-elements belong to U.  We compute 
        the probability of this event for fixed T and U and then show that the sum of these 
        probabilities over all T and U is less than 1.
          Assume that T and U are fixed, and let t be their cardinality.  By assumption, 
        t  <  2rn~1, so the probability for a random right vertex to get inside U is at most 
        1/ 2.  The probability that this happens t(a + m + 2) times for t elements of T (we 
        make a + m + 2 trials for each vertex in T) is at most 2~t('a+Tn+2K
          Let us sum these probabilities first over all pairs of T and U of given size t.  The 
        number of different T is at most  (2°)*  (we select one of 2° elements t times,  and 
        the possible coincidence and permutations make the number of sets even smaller); 
        the number of different U is at most (2Tn)t.  So the sum over sets of size t does not 
        exceed
                        turrit  _ 2 at . 2-*(ш+а+2)  __(1/ 4)*
        It remains to note the the sum XX1/4)*  (over all t ^  1) is less than 1  (it is equal 
        to 1/3).  The lemma is proven.
          Denote by ЕШ)а the first  (in some natural order)  graph that satisfies the re­
        quirements of this lemma.  Its complexity is at most 2 log а + 0(1)  (it is enough to 
        specify a and m using two halves of a 2 log а-bit string).
          For a given string В and for given m and a, consider the set Sb of а-bit strings 
        that have complexity at most m with condition B.  Consider the restriction of the 
        graph Em,a to Sb-  We get a graph with at most 2m+1 • (a + m + 2 ) < а2ш+3 edges 
        (each of at most 2m+1  left vertices has at most a + m + 2 neighbors).  Call a right 
        vertex bad if it has at least a4 neighbors.  Then the number of bad right vertices is 
        at most к = 2ш+3/а3.
          A left vertex (a string in Sb) is now called bad if all its right neighbors are bad. 
        The properties of Em^a guarantee that number of bad left vertices also is bounded 
        by к — 2171+3/a3.  Indeed, we may assume that a is large enough and к < 2Tn~1.  If 
        there are k + 1 bad left vertices, then the expander property of the graph guarantees 
        that the number of their neighbors is at least к + 1.  All they are bad (due to the 
        definition of bad left vertex).
          The bad left  vertices  can be enumerated  (given m,  a  and  B),  so  every bad 
        string can be specified by giving its ordinal number in the enumeration,  i.e.,  by 
        m — 31oga + 0 (1) bits, so
                      C(P | B, m, a) < m — 3 log a + 0(1)
        for every bad string P.  We see that the gap is larger than 2 log a needed to specify 
        m and a, so all the bad strings have conditional complexity (relative to B) less than 
        m, and A cannot appear among them.
