         is  valid for some c  and all x  in the domain of A  (the axiom guarantees that com­
         plexity does not increase);
            (c)  the  number of strings x  such that k(x)  <  n  is  in  the  range  [2n~Cl ; 2n+c'2] 
        for som.e c\, C2  and for any n  (calibration axiom).
            Then k(x) = C(x) + 0(1), that is,  the difference |k(x) — C{x)|  is bounded by a 
         constant.
           Proof.  Theorem 8 implies that C(x) ^ k(x) + 0(1).  So we need to prove that
                              k(x) ^ C(x) + 0(1).
           Lemma  1.  There is  a  constant c  and a  computable sequence  of finite  sets  of 
         binary strings
                             M0 C Mi  C M2 C • • • 
         with the following properties:  the set Mi  has exactly 2г strings and k(x) ^ i + c for 
         all x € Mi and all i.
           Computability of Mo, Mi, М2, ■ ■ ■ means that there is an algorithm that given 
         any i computes the list of elements of M*.
           PROOF.  By axiom (c) there exists a constant c such that for all i the set
                             Ai — {x I k(x) < i + c}
        has at least  2г  elements.  By item  (a)  the family Ai  is enumerable.  Remove from 
        Ai  all the elements except 2*  strings generated first.  Let  Bi  denote the resulting 
        set.  The list of the elements of Bi can be found given i:  we wait until the first 2г 
        strings are generated.  The set Bi is not necessarily included in Bi+\.  To fix this 
        we define Mi inductively.  We let Mo = Bo, and we let Mi+1  be equal to Mi plus 
        any 2г elements of Bi+i that are outside Mi.  Lemma 1 is proven.
           Lemma 2.  There is a constant c such that k(x) ^ l(x) + c for all x (recall that 
        l(x)  denotes the length of x).
           Proof.  Let Mo, Mi, М2,...  be the sequence of sets from the previous lemma. 
        There is a computable one-to-one function A defined on the union of all Mi that 
        maps Mj+i \ Mi  onto the set of binary strings of length i.  (Recall that  the set 
        Mj+1 \ Mi  has exactly 2г  strings.)  By item  (b)  we have k(A(y))  <  k(y) + c'  for 
        some c' and all x.  For all x of length i there is y € M*+1 \ Mi such that A(y) — x, 
        hence k(x) ^ k(y) + c' ^ i + c for some c and all i.  Lemma 2 is proven.
           Let us finish the proof of the theorem.  Let D be the optimal description mode, 
        and let p be a shortest description of x with respect to D.  Then
                k(x) = k(D(p)) < k(p) + 0(1) ^ l(p) + 0(1) = C(x) + 0(1).
        Note that  we  have  used  property  (b)  twice:  in  the  proof of Lemma  2  and just 
        now.                                                    □
           |~4~[ Assume that strings over the alphabet  {0,1,2,3} are used as descriptions. 
        Prove that in this case the Kolmogorov complexity,  defined  as the length of the 
        shortest description (with respect to an optimal description mode), is equal to half 
        of the regular complexity (up to an additive constant).
