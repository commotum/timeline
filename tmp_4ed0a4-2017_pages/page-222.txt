                                     6.4.  COMPLEXITIES  AND  ORACLES                      209
                On the other hand, we may consider probabilistic enumeration algorithms, i.e., 
            the non-terminating algorithms without  input  equipped with a fair random bits 
            generator and producing output elements as explained above.  The output set of 
            a probabilistic enumeration algorithm A is a random variable, and for a given set 
            S we consider the probability of the event  “A enumerates 5”.  This probability is 
            denoted by rriA(S).  Again it  is easy to  see that  there  exists  an optimal A  that 
            makes тд maximal up to an 0(l)-factor;  we fix some A and omit the subscript 
            A,  calling m(S)  the  enumeration  a priori probability  of S.  It  was shown by de 
            Leeuw, Moore, Shannon, and Shapiro [91] that m(S) is positive if and only if S is 
            enumerable.
                 209  Prove the statement above.
                (Hint:  If a subset of Г2 has positive probability, there is an interval where the 
            fraction of this subset exceeds 1/2.)
                It is easy to see that CE(S) ^ — logm(5) + 0(1).  The reverse inequality, even 
            with logarithmic precision, i.e., the inequality — logm(5) ^CE(S) + 0(\ogCE(S)), 
            is unknown.  There are some partial results.  It is true with factor 3:
                                 -logm(S) ^ 3-CE(S) + 0(\ogCE(S)), 
            as shown in [189], and for finite sets the constant 3 can be replaced by 2 (see [197]).
                6.4.3.  Limit  frequencies  and  O'-relativized  a  priori  probability.  We
            conclude this section by a result from [133]; it relates the frequencies in computable 
            sequences to the O'-relativized prefix complexity.  (See also the simplified exposition 
            in  [16].)
                Let /(0), /(1),... be a computable sequence of natural numbers.  For a given n 
            and    let us count the appearances of к among /(0),..., /(n — 1) and divide the 
            result by n.  The ratio can be called the frequency of к  among the first n terms of 
            the sequence.
                Now for a fixed к consider the liminf of this frequency as n —)■ oo;  we call it 
            the lower frequency of element к in the sequence /.
                Let pk be a lower frequency of к in a given sequence.  It is easy to check that 
            YlkPk ^ 1-  Indeed, if some partial sum of this series exceeds 1, then a finite sum 
            of lim inf’s exceeds 1, and for sufficiently large n the sum of the frequencies among 
            the first n terms of the sequence exceeds 1, which is impossible.
                The following statement is true for any computable sequence /:
                Theorem 135.  The function к i-+ pk  is 0'-lower-semicomputable.
                (Here pk is the lower frequency of к; the definition of the lower semicomputable 
            function is given in  Section 4.1;  now we consider a O'-relativized version of this 
            definition.)
                PROOF.  Indeed,  the statement r  <   pk  (where r  is some rational  number)  is 
            equivalent to the following one:
                     there exist a rational number p > r and an integer N such that 
                     the frequency of к among the first n terms of f exceeds p for all 
                     n > N.
                The property printed in italics is со-enumerable (has an enumerable negation): 
            if it is not true, we can establish it by showing a number n that violates it.  Therefore
