                             14.5.  OPTIMALITY  AND  RANDOMNESS  DEFICIENCY              449
                 362  Let  X  be  an n-bit  string of complexity  k.  Show that  the set  Px  (see
            Theorem 253) determines for which a and ß the string x is (a, /3)-stochastic:  this 
            happens iff the pair  (a, C(x) — a + ß)  is  in  Px  or  a  >  C(x)  (with  logarithmic 
            accuracy).
                 363  Prove the claim from p. 429:  the first inequality of Theorem 249 can be 
            replaced by a weaker inequality a + ß < n — O(logn).
                [Hint:  Consider the first string of length n that has no a*(n~ a) descriptions 
            (to be precise we need to subtract O(logn) from the parameters).  Its complexity 
            is close to a.  The previous problem implies that x is not (a, /3)-stochastic.)
                 364 Prove that  if a + ß  <  n — O(logn),  then  the  fraction  of non~(a, ß)- 
            stochastic strings is at least 2 ~a~^~°^ogn\
                (Hint:  Consider the first  2n~a~13 strings of length n  (in lexicographic order) 
            that do not have [a * (n — a))-descriptions (we omit logarithmic corrections in the 
            parameters).  Each of them has complexity at least a and at most a + n — a — ß = 
            n — ß.  The latter implies that for every x in this set the point  (a, C(x) — a + ß) 
            does not belong to Px.)
                 365  Prove that the first inequality of Theorem 251 can be replaced by the
            weaker inequality a + ß < n — O(logn).
                (Hint:  The proof of the upper bound remains almost the same:  the a priori 
            probability of a string provided by Problem 363 is at least 2~a.  The proof of the 
            lower bound used only the inequality a < ß — O(logn).)
                 366 For every x consider the set Qx of all pairs (a,ß) such that x is (a,ß)- 
            stochastic.  Characterize possible behaviors of Qx.
                [Hint:  Let x be an n-bit string of complexity k.  Then the set  Qx  is upward 
            closed (i.e.,  (a,ß)  G  Qx  implies  (a', ft)  G  Qx  for all a'  ^ a, ß'  ^ ß)  and contains 
            pairs (0, n — k) and (к, 0) with logarithmic precision (this means that Qx contains 
            some pairs (0(logn),n — к + O(logn)) and (k + 0(1), 0)).  On the other hand, let 
            к and n be some numbers, к ^ n, and let so,..., s& be a sequence of integers such 
            that n — к ^ so ^ si  ^    ^     = 0.  Let m be the complexity of this sequence.
            Then there exists a string x of length n and complexity к + O(logn) + 0(m) such 
            that Qx is O(logn) + O(m) close to the set S = {(a, ß) | (a ^ k) => (ß ^ sa)}.)
                367  Assume that for a string x and some a there exists a hypothesis that
            achieves minimal randomness deficiency among hypotheses of complexity at most 
            a, and its optimality deficiency exceeds its randomness deficiency by 7.  Then the 
            boundary of Px contains a segment of slope —1 that covers the interval (a — 7, a) 
            on the horizontal axis.
                (Hint:  Use the stronger statement of Theorem 256.)
                368 Let A be a family of finite sets that satisfies conditions (l)-(3) on p. 439. 
            Prove that for any x and any a ^ C(x) the following are equivalent with logarithmic 
            precision:
                   •  there exists a set A G A of complexity at most a with d(x | A) ^ ß;
                   •  there exists a set A G A of complexity at most a with S(x | A) ^ ß\
                   •  the point  (a, C(x) — a + ß) belongs to P^.
                369 Let A be an arbitrary family of finite sets enumerated by program p. 
            Prove that for every x of length at most n the following statements are equivalent
