            inequality holds:
                                C(z) ^ 2C(z\x) + 2C(z\y) + O(logn).
                Proof.  As before, we need to prove that
                                          8n ^ 3a + 2ß + 2j
            for  all  (a,ß,j)  G  C(x,y).  It  is  enough to  check  this inequality for  all  points  in 
            S П Cm-  We may assume without  loss of generality that ß  <  7.  If ß exceeds 
            7/2,  then the required inequality is obtained as follows.  Multiply the inequality 
            <2 + 7/2 + /? ^ 3n (from the definition of S) by 2 and add the inequality <2 + 7 ^ 2n 
            (from the definition of Cm)-  Otherwise (if ß ^ 7/2), we sum up the inequalities 
            <2 + 7 > 3n (definition of 5), <2 + ß ^ 2n, and <2 + ß + 7 ^ 3n (both taken from the 
            definition of См)-                                                          □
                So  now  we  have  two  constructions  of a pair  without  (extractable)  common 
            information.  The first  construction  gives  better  bounds  for the  set  C(x<y).  So 
            what are the advantages of the second one?  The most important (though informal) 
            advantage is that we have found a combinatorial reason (a graph that is difficult to 
            cover by rectangles) and a simple sufficient condition for this (no cycles of length 4).
                A more formal advantage is that in the second construction we get a stochastic 
            example—our pair is an element of maximal complexity in a simple set.  Probably 
            the first construction does not give us a stochastic example.  However, we may prove 
            the existence of stochastic pairs with minimal C(x,y):  A probabilistic method can 
            be  used  to  prove  the  existence  of a  graph  that  is  maximally  hard  to  cover  by 
            combinatorial rectangles (see [151]).
               Another advantage of the second construction is that it can be used to prove 
            a  bit  stronger  statement  using  oracle  complexity.  In  fact  we  have  shown  that 
            for every oracle A there exist two strings x and y of complexity (without oracle) 
            2n  and  mutual  information  (also  without  oracle)  n  such  that  there  is  no  string 
            2  with  CA(z)  <  l.ln,  CA(x\z)  <  1.1?г,  and  CA(y\z)  <  l.ln.  Indeed,  even  a 
            very powerful oracle still defines some combinatorial rectangles, they cover only a 
            negligible fraction of the edges,  and it  remains to select  an uncovered  (and non­
            simple) edge.  (Of course, the resulting pair depends on the oracle, since every pair 
            is simple relative to some oracle.)
                313  State and prove a similar result with additional condition и (a string of 
            unlimited complexity) instead of the oracle.
               What happens with common  (extractable)  information  in  two  strings  if we 
            add some oracle?  Some results in this direction are obtained in [138]; it is assumed 
            there that the oracle is independent with a pair x, у (so the complexities and mutual 
            information remain unchanged).  Evidently, if some 2 is the common information, 
           then adding the oracle does not  destroy this.  It  can  be shown that  the reverse 
           statement  is  true  (however,  the existing proof does not  give our  usual  O(logn)- 
            precision but a much weaker result).
               We can apply similar combinatorial techniques to other algebraic constructions. 
            For example, we may consider a pair of orthogonal one-dimensional subspaces in a 
           four-dimensional space or,  almost equivalently  (if we ignore infinitely far points), 
            a random pair (a point in a three-dimensional space and a two-dimensional affine 
           plane that goes through this point).  One cannot apply the lemma about 4-cycles 
            any more (there are 4-cycles—for any two one-dimensional subspaces one can find
