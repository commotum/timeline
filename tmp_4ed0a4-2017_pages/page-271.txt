              258                                 8.  SOME APPLICATIONS
              also consider the joint distributions £xy —  (£е,£у), etc.  For example, the random 
              variable £xy takes the value (x,y) with probability                       z).
                   Recall that by definition the Shannon entropy of the distribution  (pi,... ,py) 
              equals Y^Pi{~ logp,;);  it does not exceed                 logg,;)  for any other distribution
               (<7i,..., Çfc).  Therefore the entropy H(£xy) can be bounded (from above) by using 
              f2(x,y) as the “other”  distribution,
                                   Hitxy) ^ Y  \Y p \x,y,z)\ (-2log f(x,y)).
                                                x,y  \   z           /
              Then we write similar bounds for two other projections and apply the inequality
                                Я«) =                   < \(Н(Ь,) + Я (^ ) + Я «„))
              (Problem 230, р. 225).  We conclude that
                           я (£) ^  Y P'(x^y^z)(-lo&f{x,y) -  logg(y,z) -  logh{x,z))
                                    X,y,z
                                  = Y p,(x'y’z^~logp(x'y'z^-
                                    x,y,z
              By definition H(£) =             z p'(x, y, z)(— \ogp'(x, y, z)),  so we get a contradiction, 
              since p' is c times smaller than p (and therefore — log;/ exceeds — logp by loge).
                              8.7.  Lipschitz transformations are not transitive
                   In this section we apply Kolmogorov complexity to analyze the properties of 
              infinite sequences.  Let us start with the following definition related to the Cantor 
              (metric) space Q of infinite binary sequences.
                   A mapping / : Q —>         is a Lipschitz one if
                                              d(f(wi),/(w2)) ^ cd(ui,w2)
              for some constant c and for all u>i,u>2  £          Here d is the standard distance in the 
              Cantor space defined as 2~k where к is the first place where two sequences differ.
                   Informally speaking, Lipschitz property means that the first n digits of the se­
              quence f(co) are determined by n + 0(l) first digits of to.  In particular, all mappings 
              defined by local rules (each bit in f(co) is determined by some its neighborhood in со) 
              have Lipschitz property.
                   We are interested  in the following property of a mapping  /:  For  every  two 
              sequences co\, cü2  and  for every e  >  0,  there exist  a number N and sequences 
              and cd2 such that
                                     u'2 = /(/(/(■•• /(^i) • • ■ )))    (N iterations)
              and
                                             d(u)i,U)[) < e,    d(co2,co'2)  < £.
              (In other terms, for any two open neighborhoods there exists an orbit that starts in 
              the first one and gets inside the second one.)  We call this property the transitivity 
              of /   (in this section).
                   It  is  easy  to  check  that  left  shift  (that  deletes  the  first  bit  of the  sequence) 
              is  transitive:  If we  need  a sequence that starts with x\  and is transformed  (after 
              several shifts) into a sequence that starts with X2 , just take a sequence that starts 
              with X1X2 .
