             •  there is no admissible triple (p, q, r) for which two things happen:  (1) there 
               exists sonie B' of length q that was declared r-simple given В by (p, q, r)- 
               player of the adversary’s team, and (2) at the same time A was declared 
               p-simple given B' by the same player.2
           Why is this possible?  At every step of the game there is at least 22n-1 strings 
        not declared bad.  If we select one of them, we may declare every string as n-simple 
        given В unless we exhausted the quota, i.e., we have already declared 2n strings to 
        be n-simple given this B.  But if this happens for all non-bad B,  this means that 
        we have already made 22n_1 • 2n = 23n_1  moves.  Recall that we make one move 
        after each move of the adversary, and we will see that the adversary cannot make 
        so many moves.  So we can choose some B.
           After В is chosen in such a way that we have not exhausted the quota for n- 
        simple strings given B, we start to select A.  Let us consider some admissible triple 
         (p, q, r)  and count the strings A that do not make the position winning because of 
        this triple.  There is at most 2T strings B' of length q declared as r-simple given B. 
        For each of these B' there is at most 2P strings of length 2n declared as p-simple 
        given B'  (for the same triple = by the same team member).  So we have to avoid 
        2p+r strings for each triple  (p, q, r)  from the set M of admissible triples.  In total 
        we have to avoid 2p+r • |M| strings.  Also we have to avoid strings that are declared 
        bad,  at most 22n_1,  as well as strings declared bad for В,  at most 2n ~ 2  of them. 
        So we can make the move we want, assuming that
        (*)              2p+r ■ \M\ + 22n~ 1 + 2n' 2 < 22"'.
           Now we need to count how many moves the adversary can make.  Each of M 
        players of his team takes care of one admissible triple  (p, q, r)  and makes at most 
        22n+r moves, declaring r-simple strings, and 2qJtp moves, declaring p-simple strings. 
        So the total number of moves for all players is bounded by
                          \M\ • (2max(2n+r) + 2max(<?+P))
        (maximal values of 2n + r an q+p are taken over all elements in M).  We should also 
        add 22n~1 moves that the adversary can make declaring bad strings and 2 2n -2n ~ 2 = 
        23n—2 moves he can make declaring bad strings for 22n strings of length 2n.  So we 
        can ensure the required upper bound for the number of the adversary’s moves if
                 \M\ • (2max(2n+r) -\- 2max(<?+p)) _|_ 22n_1 -\- 23n~2  < 23n_1
        Taking into  account  that  2k + 2/  is  close to  2max{fc,/},  it  is  easy  to  see  that  the 
        conditions  (*)  and  (**)  are guaranteed  to  be true if all the  triples  (p,q,r)  G  M 
        satisfy the inequalities
                           p + r < 2n — 3logn — 0 (1),
                          2n + r < 3n — 31ogn — 0(1), 
                           p + q < 3n — 31ogn — 0(1).
        Note that there are 0(n3) triples satisfying these inequalities, and to compensate 
        for the factor  |M|, we subtracted 31ogn + 0(1), the upper bound for log|M|.  In 
        these  inequalities we write  0(1),  but some small  value,  like  10,  will  work.  Now
           2 Note that  according to our  agreement  different  players on  the  adversary team  may  make 
        different declarations,  so the term  “r-simple”  has a different  meaning for the  {p, q, r)-player and
        (p1, q', r)-player  even  when  r  is  the  same  for  both.  (In  fact,  this  freedom  is  not  used  by  the 
        adversary, with whom we really play to prove the theorem.)
