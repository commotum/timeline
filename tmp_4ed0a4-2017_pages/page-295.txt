        282     9.  FREQUENCY AND  GAME APPROACHES TO RANDOMNESS
           268 Prove the following stronger  version  of the  statement  (b)  in  the  last 
        theorem:  Let  /   be  a total  computable  noil-decreasing  unbounded  function with 
        natural arguments and values.  There exists a computably random sequence u> such 
        that C(u)q • • -oJn-i |n) ^ /(n) + 0(1) for all n.
           (Hint:  Adding a new martingale costs us one bit of advice—it should be done 
        only when the value of / increases.)
          Moreover, there exists a computably random sequence u> such that the state­
        ment  of the  last  problem  is  true  for  every  total  computable  non-decreasing  un­
        bounded function / [120].
           269 Show that for a computable measure P on fî x О and for every sequence
        a that  is  computably random with respect  to the first  projection of P,  one can 
        define the conditional probability along the second coordinate with condition  “the 
        first coordinate equals a”, using a computable version of Doob’s theorem (p. 275).
          Let us stress again that all the results about computable martingales can be 
        translated into  the  language of computable gambling strategies  (algorithms that 
        look  on  the  known  bits  and  compute  in  which  (rational)  proportion  the current 
        capital should be split between two bets.  (Recall that the underlying measure P, 
        which determines the rules of the game, is assumed to be computable and strictly 
        positive for all intervals.  When performing the rational approximations,  we may 
        assume that martingale values are separated from zero, e.g., by taking the average 
        with a martingale that equals 1 everywhere.)
                  9.9.  Martingales and Schnorr randomness
          The notion of computable randomness is closely related to Schnorr randomness 
        (see Section 3.4).  Both these notions were introduces in C.  Schnorr’s book  [166] 
        The following statement was also proved there:
          Theorem  183.  Let tt  be a computable measure,  and let all intervals £lx  have 
        positive tt-measure.  A  sequence u>  is not Schnorr random if and only if there  ex­
        ists  a  computable it-martingale m  and computable total non-decreasing unbounded 
        function g : N —> N such that
                          m(u!0u!i ■ ■ -u!n-i) > g{n)
        for infinitely many n.
          This theorem says that sequences that are not Schnorr random are not com­
        putably random, and, moreover, there is a martingale that is not only unbounded, 
        but  unbounded in a strong sense  (exceeds infinitely often some computable non­
        decreasing unbounded function).
          P r o o f.  Assume that u> is not Schnorr random.  As we have seen in Section 3.4 
        (Problem 90, p.  70), there exists a sequence of strings xo,x\,X2 , ■ ■ ■ such that the 
        series X^7r(:r0 computably converges and infinitely many of Xi are prefixes of u>.
          Let us split the series 7г(жо) + 7r(æi) + 7г(а:2) + • • ■ + тт(х{) + ■ • •  into groups (each 
        contains finitely many consecutive terms) in such a way that the sum of kth group 
        is  at  most 4~k  (discard some initial segment of the series if necessary).  Since the 
        series converges computably, this splitting can be performed in a computable way. 
        We may also assume without loss of generality that the groups can be separated 
        by string lengths:  there exists a computable sequence no  <  n\  < щ  <  • • • ,  and
