             318           10.  INEQUALITIES  FOR ENTROPY,  COMPLEXITY  AND  SIZE
                  284  Prove that for prefix complexity the inequalities from the previous the­
             orem are true with 0 (l)-precision (better than 0 (logn)-precision that we usually 
             have for strings of length n).
                 (Hint:  The argument above shows that this inequality is a linear combination of 
             basic inequalities, and the latter are true with 0 (Imprecision for prefix complexity 
             (Theorem 70,  p.  110).  Indeed,  if we  (temporarily)  redefine prefix complexity as 
             K(u\v) = K(u,v) — K(v),  then the inequalities of type  K(z\x,y)  ^  K(z)  are 
            reduced to basic inequalities.)
                 However, we want to understand the combinatorial meaning of arbitrary linear 
            inequalities (and not only those with one term in the left-hand side).  To understand 
            the problem, let us consider an example:  the basic inequality
                         C(xi) + C(xi,x2,x3) < C(xl,x2) + C(xi,x3) + 0(\ogN).
            The naive idea is to write a combinatorial inequality in the same way as before and 
            hope that for every A C X\ x X2 x X3 the following inequality holds:
                                    m(l) • m(l, 2,3) ^ m(l, 2) • m(l, 3).
            This is not the case.  This inequality is indeed true for every parallelepiped axbxc 
            where m(l) = a, m( 1, 2,3) = abc, m( 1, 2)  -  ab, and m(l, 3) — ac.  But if we add to 
            this parallelepiped another one, a' x lxl, where a'     a, then the values of m(l, 2), 
            m(l,3), and m(l,2,3) remain almost unchanged while m(l) increases significantly, 
            so the inequality may become false.
                 Another example is to consider the reverse inequality for the complexity of a
            pair
                                   C(xi) + C(x2 \x\) < C(x\,x2) + 0(1).
            What statement is its combinatorial translation?  Again,  the naive attempt is to 
            consider the inequality
                                          m(l) • m(211) < m(l, 2),
            but it does not work—the ratio m(l,2)/m(l) is an average size of a (non-empty) 
            section, and this average size can be much smaller than the maximal size m(2| 1).
                 So we now see the problem.  What can be done? There are several possibilities. 
            First,  one  may  consider  not  arbitrary  sets  but  some  special  (uniform  or  almost 
            uniform) sets, where this problem does not appear.  The other approach is to find a 
            better combinatorial translation of the inequalities.  Both approaches are considered 
            below; we start with the first one (uniform sets).
                                           10.2.  Uniform sets
                Let us recall the notation used.  Let A C X\ x • ■ ■ x Xn be a non-empty subset 
            of a Cartesian product of n finite sets X\,..., Xn.  For every set I C {1,...,n} of 
            indices, we consider the projection of A onto corresponding coordinates, which is a 
            subset of Пiei Xi-  The size of this projection is denoted by ша(1).  We consider 
            not  only projections,  but  also their sections.  Let  I and  J be two disjoint sets of 
            indices.  Let us fix /-coordinates in some way (by selection of a point in       -^"0 
            and consider the set of all /-coordinates of points in A with given /-coordinates. 
            So for every point in ПieI X{ we get some subset of YljejXj-  The maximal size 
            of these subsets is denoted by m^(J \ /)•  (If the set A is clear from the context, we 
            omit the subscript A in this notation.)
