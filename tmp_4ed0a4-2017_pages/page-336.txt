               324              10.  INEQUALITIES  FOR  ENTROPY,  COMPLEXITY  AND  SIZE
                    For example, the inequality m(l, 2) ^ m(l) -m(2) gives the following inequality 
               that is valid for arbitrary subgroups Hi and H2 of an arbitrary finite group G:
                                                        |G|          |G|    JG|_
                                                    \HlC\H2\ "  |H,|        \H2\
               or |H1n F 2|^ |H 1|-|H 2|/|G|.
                    A more interesting inequality m(l,2,3)2 < m(l, 2)m(l, 3)m(2,3) gives the in­
               equality
                                |Я, П H2 П Я3|2 > \Hi n Я2| • |Я, П Я3| • |Я2 П Я3|/|С|
               for an arbitrary finite group G and its subgroups Hi, H2, H3.
                    The  proof of Theorem  207  shows  that  the  reverse  statement  is  true:  every 
               inequality for the size of a group and its subgroups  (that  contains the products 
               of them with some exponents)  can be translated into an inequality for arbitrary 
               random variables, since we may approximate a random variable by the action of 
               the permutation group.  We get the following surprising result [37]:
                    Theorem 209  (Chan and Yeung).  Every linear equality for the entropies of 
               random variables translates into an inequality for the sizes of the group and its 
               subgroups,  and vice versa.
                                               10.5.  Almost uniform sets
                    Recall that a set A C Xi x • • • x Xn is uniform if the inequality
                    m(ki,... ,kn) ^ m(ki) • m(k2 \ h) ■ m(k3 \ ki, k2) • ... • m(kn \ ki,..., kn-i)
               (that is true for all sets) turns out to be an equality for every permutation k\,..., kn 
               of {1,2,..., n}.  Now consider a weaker requirement and say that A is c-uniform if 
               the ratio between two sides of this inequality is bounded by c (for every permuta­
               tion).  So 1-uniform sets are uniform sets as defined above.
                    Many properties of uniform sets  are still  true  (up  to  some  error  factor)  for 
               almost uniform sets.
                    Theorem 210.  Let A be a c-uniform set.
                    (a)  Let I, J, К be disjoint sets of indices.  The right-hand side in the inequality
                                           m(JuK\I) < m(J\I) -m(K\IUJ)
               (it is true for every set A) exceeds the left-hand side at most by a factor c.
                    (b)  The projection of A onto an arbitrary set of coordinates is a c-uniform set.
                    (c)  Let A'  be a subset of A that contains at least an e-fraction of elements of 
               A.  Then A' is cje-uniform.
                    (d)  Let £ be a random variable uniformly distributed in A, and let I be a set of 
               coordinates.  Then its projection £/  on I-coordinates has entropy between log m(I) — 
               loge and logm(I).
                    (e)  Let I  and J  be  disjoint sets  of coordinates.  Then  i7(£j|£/)  is  between 
               log m(J 11) — log c and log m(J\I).
                    Proof,  (a) We can group the factors in the right-hand side of the inequality 
                    m(ki,...,kn) < m(ki) • m(k2 \ h) ■ m(k3 \ ki, k2) ■ ... • m(kn \ kx,..., kn-i) 
               using the inequality
                                           m(J\I) -m(K\IUJ) ^ m(JUK\I)
