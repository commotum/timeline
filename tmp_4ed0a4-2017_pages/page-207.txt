         compleodty so we use KR  for decision compleodty to avoid confusion).  This notion 
        of complexity was first considered by D. Loveland [108].
           Let us give a definition of decision complexity using some class of machines. 
        Consider  a machine that gets a binary string as input  (and some end-marker is 
        written on the tape, so the machine knows where the input ends) and prints bits 
        on the output tape  (one by one).  The machine is not obliged to stop, so for any 
        input string X  we obtain a finite or infinite bit sequence as machine’s output.  (If 
        the output sequence is infinite, it obviously is computable.)
           Any machine of the type described defines a mapping of the set of all binary 
        strings  (that  can be  identified with the  natural  numbers  in Nj_)  into  a set  E  of 
        all  finite  and  infinite  sequences.  If M  is  a machine  of this type,  the  complexity 
        KR m(x) of a string x (with respect to decompressor M) is defined as the minimal 
        length of a string у such that M(y) (the output sequence for input y) starts with x.
            192    Check that  there  exists  an optimal  decompressor  M  in  the  described 
        class of decompressors  (i.e.,  the decompressor M that leads to smallest  KRm  up 
        to an 0 (l)-additive term).
            193    Give the definition of computable continuous mappings Nj_ —> E.  What 
        is  the  difference  between  this  definition  and  the  class  of the  machines  described 
        above, and why it is not important for the definition of complexity?
           (Hint:  A continuous mapping can map _L into some non-empty string.)
           Therefore we can fill the empty cell in our table (Figure 16).
           The following theorem lists the main properties of decision complexity:
           Theorem 127.  (a) If a string x is a prefix of a string y,  then KR (x) < KR (y).
           (b)  The  complexities  of prefixes  of a  sequence ui  €  fl form  a  non-decreasing 
        sequence that is bounded if and only if the sequence uj is computable.  ( The limit of 
        the  complexity of prefixes may be called the decision complexity of the sequence uj. 
         This complexity is finite for computable sequences and infinite for non-computable 
        ones.)
           (c)  KR (x) < C(x) + 0(1) for every string x.
           (d)  KR (x) < KM(x) + 0(1) for every string x.
           (e)  KM(x) ^ KR(x) + 0(logKR(x)) for every string x.
           (f)  C(x\l(x)) < KR(x) + 0(1) for every string x.
           (g)  // /  :  S -> E  is  a computable  continuous mapping,  then
        KR (f{x)) < KR (x) + 0(1)  (the constant in 0(1)  may depend on f  but not on x).
           (h)  If f  :  E —> Nx  is a computable continuous mapping,  then
        C(/(x)) ^ KR(x)) + 0(1)  (the constant in 0(1)  may depend on f  but not on x).
