                 Let  us identify partial mappings from E  into N with total mappings from E 
             into Nj_; the value _L replaces all undefined values.  The next theorem characterizes 
             continuous mappings (recall that a mapping is continuous if the preimage of every 
             open set is open).
                 Theorem 53.  A (total) mapping F : E —> Nj_  is continuous if and only if the 
             following are true:
                 (1)  F is increasing, i.e., x ф y implies F(x)  ф F(y) (the sign ф refers to the 
             pre-ordering relations on Nj_  and E  introduced above);
                 (2)  if x is an infinite binary sequence and F(x) ф _L,  then x has a finite prefix 
             x' such that F(x') ф _L.
                 PROOF.  Let  F  be  a  continuous  mapping.  To  verify  condition  (1),  assume 
             that  x ф y but  F(x) ф F(y).  Then F(x)  is a natural number  (and not  _L)  and 
             F(x) Ф F(y).  The preimage of the open set {F(x)} contains x and does not contain 
             y, hence it is not open.
                 Let us verify condition (2).  Assume that x is an infinite sequence and F(x) ф _L. 
             The preimage of the set {F(x)} is open and contains x.  Thus it contains some finite 
             prefix of x.
                 It  remains to verify that  any function F satisfying conditions  (1)  and  (2)  is 
             continuous.  We need to verify only that the preimage of every natural number is 
             open  (indeed,  the preimage of the entire space is open,  and other open sets are 
             unions of singletons formed by natural numbers).  It is enough to verify that the 
             preimage  of every  natural  number  satisfies  the  conditions  (1)  and  (2)  from  the 
             previous theorem.  This is a straightforward corollary of our assumptions.  (Note 
             that if 
                    x' is a prefix of x and F(x') ф _L, then F(x') — F(x), as F is increasing.)   □
                 For any given continuous mapping F : E —> Nj_, consider the set Гр of all pairs 
             (x,n) eSxN such that F(x) = n. Note that the set Г p is only a part of the graph 
             of the mapping F (we consider only finite strings x and require that n ф _L).
                 Theorem 54.  The mapping                  is a bijection between continuous map­
             pings E —> Nj_  and sets AcSxN satisfying the following conditions:
                 (1)  (x,n) e A,  x фу  =>  (y,n) в A;
                 (2)  (x,n)  G A,  (x, m) E A  =>  m — n.
                 PROOF.  Assume that the mapping F is continuous.  If F(x) = n €  N,  then 
             condition (1) of the previous theorem guarantees that F(y) = n for every y ^ x. 
             This proves that the set  Гр  satisfies  condition  (1).  As F(x)  cannot be equal to 
             two different numbers,  condition  (2)  is also satisfied.  Thus,  for every continuous 
             mapping F the set Гp has properties (1) and (2).
                 It  is easy to see that the set Гp  uniquely determines F:  if x is a finite string, 
             then F(x) is the second component of the (unique) pair (x,n) € Г^.  If there is no
