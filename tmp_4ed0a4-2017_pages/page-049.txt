              23  Prove that C(x, C(x)) = C(x) + 0(1).
             {Hint:  C(x,C(.x)) ^ C(x) + 0(1) for evident reasons.  On the other hand, the 
          shortest description of x determines both x and C{x).)
              24  Prove that if C(x) ^ n and C{y) ^ n, then C(x, y) ^2n + 0(1).
                              2.2.  Conditional complexity
             When transmitting  a file,  one  could  try  to  save  communication  charges  by 
          compressing that file.  The transmission could be made even more effective if an old 
          version of the same file already exists at the other side.  In this case we need only 
          describe the changes made.  This could be considered as a kind of motivation for 
          the definition of conditional complexity of a given string x relative to a (known) 
          string y.
             A  conditional  decompressor  is  a  computable  function  D  of two  arguments, 
          the  description and the condition (both arguments and the value of D are binary 
          strings).  If D{y, z) — x, we say that y is a (conditional)  description of x when z is 
          known (or relative to z).  The complexity Cd{x\z) is then defined as the length of 
          the shortest conditional description:
                            CD(x\z) = min{l{y) I D(y, z) = x}.
          We say that (conditional) decompressor D\  is not worse than D2 if
                                CDl(x\z) ^ Cd2(x\z) + c
          for some constant c and for all x and г.  A conditional decompressor is  optimal if 
          it is not worse than any other conditional decompressor.
             Theorem 17.  There exist optimal conditional decompressors.
             Proof.  This conditional version of the Solomonoff- Kolmogorov theorem can 
          be proved in the same way as the unconditional one (Theorem 1, p. 3).
             Fix some programming language where one can write programs for computable 
          functions of two arguments, and let
                                   D(py, z) =p{y,z),
          where p{y, z) is the output of program p on inputs у and г, and p is the prefix-free 
          encoding of p.
             It is easy to see now that if D' is a conditional decompressor and p is a program 
          for D', then
                               CD{x\z) ^ CD'(x\z) + l(p).
          The theorem is proved.                                          □
             Again, we fix some optimal conditional decompressor D and omit index D in 
          the notation.
             Let us start with some simple properties of conditional complexity.
             Theorem 18.
                                 C(x I y) ^ C{x) + 0(1); 
                                 C{x\x) = 0(1);
                             C{f{x,y)\y) < C(x\y) -f 0(1); 
                                 C{x\y) < C{x\g{y)) + 0(1).
