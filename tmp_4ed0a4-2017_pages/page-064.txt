                                               2.3.    COMPLEXITY AS THE AMOUNT OF  INFORMATION                                                              49
                     C(z\x,y) and C(y\x,z), we get the inequality
                                                      C(z\x,y) + C(y\x,z) < C(y,z) + O(logn).
                    It remains to rewrite the right-hand side of this inequality as C(y) + C(z\y), and 
                    note that C(z\x,y) < C{z\y) and C(y\x,z) < C(y).                                                                                         □
                           Instead we could just add two inequalities (the basic one and the inequality for 
                    the complexity of a pair):
                                                 C(x, y, z) + C(y) < C(x, y) + C(y, z) + O(logn),
                                                              C(x, y, z) < C(y) + C(x, z) + O(logn),
                    and then cancel C(y) in both sides.  (This proof, as well as the previous one, has 
                    an important aesthetic problem:  both treat x, y,z in a non-symmetric way while 
                    the statement of the theorem is symmetric.)
                           We return to the inequality of Theorem 26 and refer to its geometric conse­
                    quences in Chapter 10.
                           We can provide a more systematic treatment of the different complexity quan­
                    tities  related to  three strings  as  follows.  There  are seven basic  quantities:  three 
                    of them are complexities of individual strings,  another three are complexities  of 
                    pairs, and one more is the complexity of the entire triple.  Other quantities such as 
                    conditional complexity and mutual information can be expressed in terms of these 
                    seven complexities.  To understand better what requirements these seven quanti­
                    ties  should  satisfy,  let  us  make  a linear  transformation  in the seven-dimensional 
                    space and switch to new coordinates.  Consider seven variables ai,û2,... ,а? that 
                    correspond to the seven regions shown in Figure 5.

                           Formally,  the coordinate transformation is given by the following equations: 
                                                           C(x) = ûi + Û2 T a4 T a5?
                                                           C(y)  =  Û2  +  a 3 +  a 5  +  a 6?
                                                           C(z) =04 + 05 + 06 + a75 
                                                       C(x, y) = ai  + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + a6,
                                                       C(x, z) = ai  + a2 +< 24 + a5 + a6 + a7,
                                                        C(y, z) = a2  + a3 + a4 + a5 + a6 + a7,
