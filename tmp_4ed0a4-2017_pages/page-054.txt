                                       2.2.  CONDITIONAL  COMPLEXITY                          39
             number of x in the enumeration of B. and О (log 77,) is used to specify a and m.  So 
             we get,
                                        C(x) < (a -  m) + О (log 72), 
             and it remains to add this inequality and the preceding one.                     □
                 This theorem can be considered as the complexity counterpart of the following 
             combinatorial statement.  Let dbea finite set of pairs.  Its cardinality is (obviously) 
            bounded by the product of the cardinality of A's projection onto the first coordinate 
            and the maximal cardinality of the sections Ax.  This corresponds to the inequality 
             C(x,y)  ^ C(x) + C(y I x) + О (log 72).  The reverse inequality needs a more subtle 
            interpretation.  Let  A  be  a set  of pairs,  and  let p  and  q  be some  numbers  such 
            that  the cardinality of A does not  exceed pq.  Then we can split  A into parts P 
            and Q with the following properties:  the projection of P onto the first coordinate 
            has at most p elements, while all the sections Qx of Q (for element in Qx the first 
            coordinate equals x)  have at most q elements.  (Indeed,  let P be the union of all 
            sections that have more than q elements.  The number of such sections do not exceed 
            p.  The remaining elements form Q.)  We return to this combinatorial translation 
            in Chapter 10.
                 Note that in fact we have not used the lengths of x and y, only their complex­
            ities.  So we have proved the following statement:
                 Theorem 22 (Kolmogorov-Levin, complexity version).
                                 C{x, у) = C(x) + C(y I x) + О (log C(x, y)) 
            for all strings x  and y.
                 35  Give a more detailed analysis of the additive terms in the proof, and show
            that
                       C{x) + C{y\x) < C(x,y) + 31ogC(x,y) + 0(loglogO(x,7/)).
                 36  Show that if C(x,y\k, I) < k+l, then C(x \kj) < k+0( 1) or C(y \ x, k, I) <
            I + O(l).
                 (Hint:  This is what we actually proved in the proof of Theorem 22.}
                 37  Show that О (log 77.) terms are unavoidable in the Kolmogorov-Levin the­
            orem in both directions:  for each n there exist strings x and у of length at most n 
            such that
                                  C(x,y) > C(x) + C(y\x) + logn -  0(1) 
            as well as strings x and у of length at most n such that
                                 C(x,y) ^ C(x) + C(y\x) - log72 + 0(1).
                 (Hint:  For the first  inequality we can refer to the remark after  Theorem  16 
            (p.  31).  For the second note that C(x,l(x))  = C(x)  for every x, while C(x\l(x)) 
            can be equal to l(x) + 0(1) and C(x) + 0(1).  Then we can take a random length 
            between n/2 and n and a random string of this length.)
                 38  Prove that changing one bit in a string of length n changes its complexity
            at  most  by  log 72 + О (log log 77.).  Prove  the  same  for  the  conditional  complexity 
            0(х|тг).
                As we have seen in  Problem  7  (p.  21),  for  every  72-bit  string x  there  exists 
            another string x' of the same length that differs from x in one position only such 
            that  C(x')  <  72 — log72 + 0(1)  (and  therefore  C(x'\n)  < n — logn + 0(1)).  In
