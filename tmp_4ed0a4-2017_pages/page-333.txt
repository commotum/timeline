                                   10.3.  CONSTRUCTION  OF  A  UNIFORM  SET                   321
                 Theorem 205.  A set A is uniform if and only if for every I — {«i,..., г^}  the 
             random variable £/ = (£^,... , £ifc)  has uniform distribution on its range.
                 P r o o f.  Let I be some set of indices, and let J be its complement (the difference 
             between {1,2,... ,n} and I).  Then the equality
                                       m(l, 2,... ,n) = m(I) • m(J\I)
             means that that  the average size of a (non-empty)  section obtained by fixing I- 
             coordinates,  i.e.,  m(l, 2,...,n)/m{I),  is equal to its maximal size m(J\I), so all 
             the  sections  have  the  same  size.  And  this  means  that  all  the  values  of £/  are 
             équiprobable.
                 On the other hand, assume that for some set A for every set I of indices all the 
             values of £/ are équiprobable.  In particular, for I = {1,..., n — 1} we get that all 
             (non-empty) sections obtained by fixing the first n — 1 coordinates have the same 
             size, so
             (*)          m(l, 2 ,... ,n) = m(n | 1, 2,..., n — 1) • m(l, 2 ,... ,n — I).
             Moreover, since the random variable  (£i,£2, • • • 5£n-i)  is uniformly distributed in 
             the projection of the set A to coordinates 1,2,..., n — 1, we get the same picture 
             for this projection:  £1, ... ,£n-i  are random variables obtained by projection of a 
             point uniformly distributed in this set.  Using induction, we may assume that this 
            set is uniform.  Then the equation (*) can be continued:
            m(l,2, ...,n)
                = m(n 11, 2,..., n — 1) • m(n — 111,2,..., n — 2) • ... • m(3 [1,2) • m(211) • m(l).
            The same argument can be applied for every ordering of coordinates, so we conclude 
            that A is uniform according to our definition.                                     □
                 C o r o lla r y .  For the random variables £1, • • • ,£n  constructed in this way, the 
             entropy of the tuple £/  equals log m(I)  (for every I C {1,2,..., n}).
                 So we conclude that the following statement is true:
                 Theorem  206.  Every linear inequality that is true for entropies is also true 
            for the log-sizes of projections for uniform sets.
                 For example, if А С X\ x X2 x A3 is uniform, then the inequality
                                     m(l) ■ m(l, 2,3) ^ m(l, 2) ■ m(l, 3)
            holds, since it corresponds to the basic inequalities for complexities and entropies 
             (Theorem 24).  Note that  (as we have discussed)  this inequality is false for some 
            non-uniform sets.
                 In  the  next  section,  following  [37],  we  prove  a  reverse  statement.  Starting 
            from a tuple of random variables, we find a uniform set for which the log-sizes of 
            projections are (almost) proportional to the entropies of the corresponding groups 
            of variables.
                                  10.3.  Construction of a uniform set
                 Assume that we have some tuple of (dependent) random variables 771,..., rjn\ all 
            of them have finite range.  We want to construct a uniform set A whose projection
