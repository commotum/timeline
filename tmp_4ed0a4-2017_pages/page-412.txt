                          13.2.  PROBLEM  COMPLEXITY AND  INTUITIONISTIC  LOGIC          403
                 335  Find the complexity of a A (b —» c)  (with logarithmic precision).
                (Answer:  C(a) + C(c\a, b).  Hint4.  Given a and a program that maps  [a. b]  to 
            c,  we  can convert  b to c.  In the opposite direction,  let  us add to the  (supposed) 
            answer the value of C(b\a).  Then we get C(a,b,c).  So it is enough to show that 
            the triple a, b, c can be reconstructed from the set of the following objects:  a, the 
            program that converts a to 6, and the program that converts b to c.)
                 336 Prove that the complexity of (x V y)     (zVy) is 0(1), but the reverse 
            implication (x\/y) —> (x V y) has the same complexity as x V y, up to an O(logn) 
            additive term, if x and y are strings of length at most n.
                (Hint:  Let p be a solution to  (xVy)  —>  (x V y).  We say that a pair  (u, v)  is 
            compatible with p if и and v are strings of length at most n and for all strings w of 
            length at most n both values [p]([w, w\) and [p]([tu, u]) are solutions touV r.  Then 
            for every pair (w, v) compatible with p, we have either и = x or v = y.)
                 337 Show that the problem
                                       ((zVy)    (x V y)) -> (xVy)
            has complexity O(logn) if x and у are strings of length at most n.
                The last  two  problems show  the difference  between disjunction  and  pseudo­
            disjunction.  They show, in particular, that problems xVx and x V x differ substan­
            tially (although their complexities are close).  The latter problem xVx is equivalent 
            to x.  On the other hand, the problem x\/x is not equivalent to x, as the complexity 
            of the problem  (x\/x)  —> x is close to the complexity of x itself and thus can be 
            arbitrarily large.  (In the next section, we will define formally what it means that 
            the two problems are equivalent.)
                Historical remarks.  The study of operations  Л, V, —>  on problems goes back 
            to Kolmogorov [76]  and Kleene [75].  The complexity of problems obtained from 
            singletons by these operations was studied in  [182]  and  [142].  The formula con­
            sidered in Problem 335 is from [142].  Problem 336, although inspired by [182], is 
            presumably new.
                        13.2.  Problem complexity and intuitionistic logic
                The problem X  —>  Y  has  the  following property:  If both  problems  X  and 
            X —»• Y are simple, then Y is simple, too.  Moreover,
                                      C{Y) < C(X) + C{X -+У).
            This  inequality  is  true  with  precision  0(logC(X))  (or  0(\ogC{X  —>  Y))).  It 
            generalizes the inequality
                                         C(y) < C(x) + C(yjx)
            (which is true for all strings x  and y,  with logarithmic precision).  Moreover,  we 
            can add Y in the left-hand side:
                                    C(X A Y)^ C{X) + C(X ^  Y).
            Note, however, that the reverse inequality is not true anymore (recall that reverse 
            inequality holds for singleton sets X, Y, i.e., for strings).
                 338  Find problems (sets) X and Y such that C(X A Y) is significantly less
            than C(X) + C(X      Y).
