                 Several times we have used the upper bound 2n  for the number of strings x 
             with C(x) < n.  Note that, in contrast to other bounds,  it involves no constants. 
             Nevertheless  this  bound  has  a  hidden  dependence  on  the  choice  of the  optimal 
             description mode:  if we switch  to  another optimal  description  mode,  the set  of 
             strings x such that C(x) < n can change!
                 |~2~| Show that the number of strings of complexity less than n is in the range 
             [2n-c; 2n]  for some constant c for all n.
                 (Hint:  The upper bound 2n is proved in the introduction, the lower bound is 
             implied by the inequality C(x) ^ l(x) + c:  the complexity of all the strings of length 
             less than n — c is less than n.)
                 Show that the number of strings of complexity  exactly n does not exceed 2n 
             but can be much less:  e.g., it is possible that this set is empty for infinitely many n.
                 (Hint:  Change an optimal description mode by adding 0 or 11 to each descrip­
            tion so that all descriptions have even length.)
                 [~3~| Prove that the average complexity of strings of length n is equal to n + 0(l).
                 (Hint:  Let ak denote the fraction of strings of complexity n — k among strings of 
            length n.  Then the average complexity is by     kak less than n.  Use the inequality
            ctfc  ^ 2~k and the convergence of the series Y^k/2k.)
                 In the next statement we establish a formal relation between upper bounds of 
            complexity and upper bounds of cardinality.
                 Theorem 7.  (a)  The family of sets Sn =   {x \ C(x)  <  n}  is enumerable,  and 
             |S„|  < 2n for all n.  Here |Sn|  denotes the cardinality of Sn.
                 (b)      IfVn  (n — 0,1,... )  is an enumerable family of sets of strings and \ Vn\ < 2n 
            for all n,  then there exists c such that C(x) < n + c for all n  and all x € Vn.
                 In this theorem we use the notion of an enumerable family of sets.  It is de­
            fined  as follows.  A set  of strings  (or natural numbers,  or other finite objects)  is 
             enumerable (= computably enumerable — recursively enumerable) if there is an al­
            gorithm generating all elements of this set in some order.  This means that there 
            is  a program that never terminates and prints all the elements of the set in some 
            order.  The intervals between printing elements can be arbitrarily large; if the set is 
            finite,  the program can print nothing after some time (unknown to the observer). 
            Repetitions are allowed, but this does not matter since we can filter the output and 
            delete the elements that have already been printed.
                 For example, the set of all n such that the decimal expansion of \p2 has exactly 
            n consecutive nines is enumerable.  The following algorithm generates the set:  com­
            pute decimal digits of \pl starting with the most significant ones.  Once a sequence 
            of consecutive n nines surrounded by non-nines is found, print n and continue.
                 A family of sets Vn  is called enumerable if the set of pairs  {(n, x)  \  x  €  Vn} 
            is  enumerable.  This implies  that  each of the  sets  Vn  is  enumerable.  Indeed,  to 
            generate elements of the set Vn for a fixed n, we run the algorithm enumerating the 
            set  {(n, x)  I  x € Vn}  and print the second components of all the pairs that have n 
            as the first component.  However, the converse statement is not true.  For instance, 
            assume that Vn is finite for every n.  Then every Vn is enumerable, but at the same 
            time it may happen that the set {(n,x) \ x € Vn} is not enumerable (say Vn — {0} 
            if n  6  S and  Vn  =  0 otherwise,  where S is any non-enumerable set of integers). 
            One can verify that a family is enumerable if and only if there is an algorithm that
