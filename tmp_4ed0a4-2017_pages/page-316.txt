                                                                                      9.13.           CHANGE IN THE MEASURE AND RANDOMNESS                                                                                                                                      303
                                    of 1  and 0 in the old measure and in the changed measure.  In logarithmic scale, 
                                    the logarithm of the ratio in question is equal to the sum of
                                                                                    ln(p7p) = ln(l + eq) ^ eq -  (eq)2 ^ e(l -  p) -  e2
                                    or
                                                                                        \n(q'/q) = ln(l — ep) ^ —ep — (ep)2 ^ —ep — e2
                                    for  all  bits  in  x  (with corresponding probabilities p  and q).  The first expression 
                                    is  used  for  ones  in  x  and  the  second  is  used  for  zeros.  (We  used  the  inequality 
                                   ln(l + h) ^ h — h2 that is true for all h with \h\ ^ 1/2.)
                                                What happens when we add all these inequalities?  We get a lower bound for 
                                   the logarithm of the ratio p'(x)/p(x) of two measures for x; this lower bound has 
                                   a common factor e.  Then we have m ones (each term (1 — p) contributes one, and 
                                   there are m of terms of this type) minus the sum of all p*, where pi is the conditional 
                                   probability of 1 at zth place, and minus ns2,
                                                                                                                  i      P'W ^  (                                     V-           a                 2 
                                                                                                                  m —                      > £{m -  l^pi) -  пе  . 
                                                                                                                          p{x)
                                   We are interested in x where the excess m — ^P i exceeds d.  For them we have
                                                                                                              ,      P'{x)                         ,                                                     ч
                                                                                                              In           .    .      > Ed — ПЕ  = E{d — пе). 
                                                                                                                      p(x)
                                   This is true for all e  G  (0,1/2), so let us choose e  to get the strongest statement. 
                                   The right-hand side  achieves  maximal value when  e  =  d/2n  (note  that  d  ^  n, 
                                   because the number of ones in x does not exceed n, so £ = d/2n < 1/2).
                                               Therefore
                                                                                                                                     In V'(x) > d2/An
                                                                                                                                             p{x)
                                   for x where the excess is greater than d, and
                                                                                                                                       P'(x)  .                    d2/4n
                                                                                                                                        p(x)
                                   as we claimed.  This finishes the proof.                                                                                                                                                                                                       □
                                               It is instructive to look at the special case where zeros and ones are équiproba­
                                   ble.  The probability that the number of ones exceeds its expectation (n/2) by 2^/n 
                                   is bounded by 1/e, and expectation exceeds 2кл/п with probability at most l/efc 
                                   Comparing this with the  classical  de  Moivre-Laplace  theorem,  we  see  that  our 
                                   bound is not optimal, but the difference is only in the coefficient (in the exponent).
                                               Now we can repeat the proof of the SLLN with this bound and get the following 
                                   result that is true for arbitrary measure p on the space fh
