                 Theorem 69.
                                            K(K(x)\x,y,K(x,y)) = 0(l), 
                                   K(K(y IX, K(x)) IX. y,K(x,y)) = 0( 1). 
                 (Of course the same is true for K(y) and K(x\y, K(y)).) 
                  113 Give a direct proof of Theorem 69.
                 (Hint:  Knowing x, y and K(x,y), we may look for an upper bound d for K(x) 
             such  that  K(y\x,d) + d  becomes equal  to  K(x,y).  The  coincidence  (up  0(1)) 
             implies that d — K(x) + 0(1); indeed, if d — К(x) + m for some m, the complexity 
             K(y\x,d)  can  decrease  (because  of this  m)  at  most  by  O(logm),  and  the  sum 
             becomes bigger.)
                 Using Theorem 67 we can easily show that the basic inequality of Theorem 24 
             (p.  47)  is true with 0(Imprecision for prefix complexity (recall that we have loga­
             rithmic error term for plain complexity):
                 Theorem 70.
                                K(x, y,z) + K(x) ^ K(x,y) + K(x, z) + 0(1) 
             for arbitrary strings x,y,z.
                 Proof.  Indeed, the right-hand side can be rewritten as
                               K{x) + K(y I x, K(x)) + K(x) + K{z I x, K{x)), 
             and the left-hand side equals
                                       K{x) + K(y, z\x, K(x)) + K(x).
             It remains to prove that
                              K(y,z\x,K(x)) ^ K(y\x,K(x)) + K(z\x,K(x)), 
             and this inequality is a relativized version of Theorem 60 (p. 97).                 □
                 Let us provide also a direct proof of Theorem 70 using semimeasures.  We have 
             to show that (up to O(l)-factors)
                                      m(x, y, z)m(x) ^ m(x, y)m(x, z),
             where m is the maximal lower semicomputable semimeasure.  Dividing by m(x), 
             we get an inequality
                                         m(x, y)m(x, z < m(x,y,z).
                                              m(x)
             Let  us  check that  the left-hand  side  of this  inequality has  a finite sum  (over  all 
             triples x, y, z).  Indeed,
                                              m(x,y)m(x,z)
                                         E--------г--------  ^ m(x)
                                                  mix)
             (since J2ym(x^y) ^ тп(х) and J2zm(x^z) ^ тп(х)\ we omit the 0(1) factors).
                 This is not enough:  since we have m(x) in the denominator, the fraction
                                                m(x, y)m(x, z) 
                                                     m(x)
             is not (necessarily) lower semicomputable, and we cannot use the maximality prop­
             erty.  So we need to use the following trick (similar to the trick used in the proof of 
             Theorem 67) to construct a lower semicomputable upper bound for this fraction.
