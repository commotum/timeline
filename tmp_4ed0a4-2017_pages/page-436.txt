                               14.1.  THE  FRAMEWORK  AND  RANDOMNESS  DEFICIENCY                        427
                    346         Assume that a function 5(x\A)  is given,  where x  is a string and  A is 
              a  set  containing  that  string  and  5  has  the  following  properties:  (a)  5  is  lower 
              semicomputable;  (b)  for  every  finite  set  A  and  for  every  natural  number  к  the 
              fraction of strings in A with S(x \ A) > к is less than 2~k.  Then S(x \ A) < d(x \ A) + 
              0(1).
                   This statement is a direct corollary of a similar statement for conditional Kol­
              mogorov complexity (see Theorem 19 on p. 36).  Its meaning is the following.  There 
              are different opinions about which elements of a given set are typical and which are 
              not.  That is, there exist different methods to measure non-typicality.  Assume that 
              we normalize each method so that, after normalization, in each set the fraction of 
              /с-non-typical  element  is  less  than  2 ~k.   Assume  also  that  we  can  reveal  non­
              typicality of a given string in a given set provided we have enough time for that 
              (that time can be quite long and not bounded by any total computable function). 
              Then there is the best such method in the sense that the deficiency it reveals is not 
              less than the deficiency revealed by any other method (up to an additive constant).
                   Randomness deficiency in a finite set is similar to randomness deficiency of an 
              infinite  sequence  with  respect  to  a probability  measure  (see  Section  3.5).  More 
              specifically, it is similar to the maximal probability bounded randomness test.  One 
              can also define an analogue of an expectationally bounded randomness test.
                    347         Let the prefix randomness deficiency of a string x in a finite set A be 
              defined as dp(x\ A) = log2 \A\ — K(x\ A).  Show that dp(x\ A) is a maximal lower 
              semicomputable function S of x and A such that (1/|A|) J2xeA2<5(z|A) is at most 1
              for all finite sets A.
                   (Hint:  Recall that prefix complexity coincides with the negative logarithm of 
              the a priori probability.)
                   Thus a finite set A is considered a good explanation for x if it is simple and 
              the randomness deficiency d(x\ A) of x in A is small.  Those strings having such an 
              explanation are called stochastic.  Are there non-stochastic strings?  This question 
              will be answered in the next section.
                   Notice that we consider only statistical hypotheses that are uniform distribu­
              tions over finite sets.  In a more general framework one can consider also arbitrary 
              probability distributions over strings (say, with finite supports and rational values 
              to avoid technical problems).  For such distributions the randomness deficiency of 
              a string x with respect to a distribution P is defined as — log2 P(x) — C(x \ P)  (if 
              P(x)  =  0,  then the deficiency  is  infinite:  for such strings  x  the hypothesis  P  is 
              completely unsatisfactory).
                  For uniform distributions (all elements of a finite set A have probability 1/|A|), 
              the generalized definition of randomness deficiency coincides with the previous one. 
              Notice that the general case is not very different from the case of uniform distribu­
              tions:
                   348         Assume that x is a string of length n and P is a probability distribution 
              (not necessarily uniform)  of complexity к such that the randomness deficiency of 
              x with respect to P is at most I.  Then there is a set A of complexity at most к + 
              0(log(/ + n))  containing x  such  that  the  randomness  deficiency  of x  in  A  is  at 
              most I + 0(log(/ + n)).
                   (Hint:  Let  A  =  {y  \  P(y)  ^ p]  where p is the probability of x with respect 
              to P rounded to the nearest integer power of 2.)
