                           14.3.  TWO-PART  DESCRIPTIONS        431
         objects is due to Muchnik  [139, Theorem 10.10], who established it for all  (a,/3) 
         with  3a + ß  <  n.  Both  papers  [210]  and  [139]  used  the  Kolmogorov  formula 
         log \A\ — C(x) for randomness deficiency.
           Theorem 251 appears to be new.  Note that this theorem and Muchnik’s re­
         sult use incomparable assumptions on the parameters a, ß.  Besides, Theorem 251 
         estimates the a priori measure of a larger set than Muchnik’s result.
                          14.3.  Two-part descriptions
           There is another natural way to estimate the quality of statistical hypotheses. 
         Let us start with the following remark.  If a string x belongs to some finite set A, 
         we can specify x in two steps:
              •  first, we specify A;
              •  then we specify the ordinal number of x in A (in some natural ordering, 
               say, the lexicographic one).
         Therefore, we get C(x) ^ C(A) + log фА for every element x of an arbitrary finite 
         set A (again with logarithmic precision).
           There can be many two-part descriptions of the same string x (with different 
         sets A).  Which of them are better?  Naturally, we would like to make both parts 
         smaller  (by  finding  a simpler  and  smaller set  A):  if we  can  decrease  one of the 
         parameters while not increasing the other one, this is an improvement.  But which 
         is better:  simple A or small complex A?  We can compare the lengths of the resulting 
         two-part descriptions and choose a set A which gives the shorter one.  This approach 
         is often called the Minimum Description Length principle (MDL).
           The following simple observation shows that we can move the information from 
         the first part of the description into its second part (leaving the total length almost 
         unchanged).  In this way we make the set  smaller  (the price we pay is that  its 
         complexity increases).
           Theorem 252.  Let x be a string, and let A be a finite set that contains x.  Let 
         i  be a non-negative integer such that i < log фА.  Then there exists a finite set A' 
         containing x such that # A! < фА/2г andC(A') < C(A) +i + 0(logmin{i, C(A)}).
           Proof.  List all the elements of A in some  (say,  lexicographic)  order.  Then 
         split the list into 2* parts (first фА/2г elements, next фА/2г elements etc.; we omit 
         evident precautions for the case when фА is not a multiple of 2г).  Then let A' be 
         the part with x.  To specify A',  it  is enough to specify A and the part  number, 
         which requires at most i bits.  (The logarithmic term at the end is needed to form 
         a pair of these two descriptions;  it is enough to specify the length of the shorter 
         description.)                                          □
           We will use the following convenient (though non-standard) terminology:  a set 
         A is called а (к * I)-description  (of every its element) if C(A) ^ к and log фА ^ I. 
         Theorem 252 can now be formulated as follows:  if some x has a (k* ^-description, 
         then for every i 6 [0,1] it also has ((k + i + 0(logmin(i, к))) * (I — i))-description.
           For  a  given  string  x  let  us  consider  the  set  Px  of all  pairs  (k,l)  such  that  x 
         has а  (к * ^-description,  i.e.,  there exists a set  A containing x with C(A) ^ к  and 
         log фА ^ 1.  Obviously,  this set  is  closed  upwnrds  and  contains W4th each point  all 
         points  on  the  right  (with  the  bigger  к)  and  on  the  top  (with  bigger  I).  The  last 
         theorem says  that  we  can  also  move  down-right  adding  (г, —i)  (with  logarithmic 
         precision).
