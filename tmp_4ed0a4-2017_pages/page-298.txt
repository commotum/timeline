                              9.10.  MARTINGALES  AND  EFFECTIVE  DIMENSION               285
                Theorem  184.  A  set A  c  Q,  is  an а-null  set  if and  only  if there  exists  a 
            martingale m such that for every со € A the ratio
                                                  m(x)
            is  not bounded on prefixes of uj.
                (For a = 1, we get Theorem 177.)
                This result can be reformulated as follows.  Assume that the gambler is taxed. 
            After each game she pays a tax proportional to her capital, so the capital is multi­
            plied by some constant factor 2a_1 < 1.  Then the capital m(x)  (as a function of a 
            history X of the game) is no more a martingale, but satisfies the condition
                                     2a~1m(x)     m(x 0)    m(x 1)
                                                     2   +    2
            and this can be rewritten as
                                       2  am(x) = m(x 0) + m(x 1).
            Functions that satisfy this condition are called (following [110]) a-gales.  They also 
            can be defined equivalently in terms of measures:  An a-gale is a function
                                               p(x) 2al<x\
            where p(x) = ir(Qx) and 7r is a measure on Q (we do not require here that 7r(f7) = 1 
            or m(A) = 1).  Similarly we can define a-supergales, where an additional decrease 
            in capital is allowed after each game.  The condition is
                                       2am(x) ^ m(x0) + m(x 1).
            In this language the statement of Theorem 184 says that for every a-gale the set 
            of sequences,  for whose prefixes this a-gale is unbounded,  is an cc-null set;  every 
            a-null set is contained in a set of this kind (for some a-gale).
                P r o o f.  The  proof is just  a slightly modified argument  used to prove Theo­
            rem 177.  We use the language of cc-gales (see above).  Let m be an arbitrary a-gale. 
            We need to show that the set of sequences, where m is unbounded, is an а-null set. 
            It is enough to show that strings x, where m achieves к (or more) for the first time, 
            have the sum of а-powers of measures at most 1/k.  Writing m(x) as p(x)2al(x\  we 
            see that for these strings we have p(x) > k2~al^x\   All the strings are incompatible 
            (none of them is a prefix of any other).  So the sum of p-measures is at most 1, and 
            so the sum of 2~al№ for all these x (=the sum of а-sizes of corresponding intervals) 
            does not exceed 1/k.
                In the other direction, let A be an а-null set.  We need to construct an a-gale 
            that is unbounded on prefixes of uj for every wed.  For each k, consider a cover 
            of A by intervals with sum of а-sizes at most 1/k.  We will construct an a-gale m*, 
            that reaches к on these intervals.  (Then we compute the sum of all a-gales mAk 
            with coefficients 2k, since the sum of a-gales is an a-gale.)
                How do we construct m^?  For each x we consider an a-gale that equals 1 on x 
            and equals 0 on all other strings of the same length; the values for shorter strings 
            are determined uniquely by the definition of a-gale, and for longer strings we choose 
            some extension.  On the root (empty string) the value of this a-gale is 2~al(x\  i.e., 
            the а-size of x.  So the sum of values of this a-gale (over all x in the cover)  is at 
            most 1/k in the root, and multiplying it by k, we get m*,.                    □
