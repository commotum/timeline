                    13.6.  COMPLEXITY  NOT REDUCIBLE TO COMPLEXITIES  OF TUPLES      417
            be below щ.  Therefore, either vi  is incomparable with v  (and we have a pair of 
           random strings from incomparable worlds) or is strictly above v.  In the latter case 
           either Ф —> 0 is true in v\, or we can repeat our arguments for tq  and so on.  This 
           process cannot  be infinite  since  model К is finite  and cannot contain an infinite 
           increasing sequence of worlds.
               We have finished our induction argument showing that the set Ф(^1,..., Xk) is 
           algorithmically equivalent to Хф.  By assumption, Ф is false in the root world, so all 
           strings in Х Ф have length much bigger than n, and the complexity of Ф(Ах,..., Xk) 
           exceeds n.  However, we need to guarantee also that complexities of all Xi are 0(n). 
           To achieve this, we need to adjust our argument:  We may assume without loss of 
           generality that К has maximal element where all variables are true (this does not 
           change the truth values in other worlds).  Also we may assume that length 2n is 
           assigned to this maximal world.  Then every random string of length 2n belongs to 
           all Xi.                                                                    □
               Historical remark.  The  proof of Theorem  246  (due  to  An.  A.  Muchnik)  is 
           published here for the first time.
                     13.6.  A problem whose complexity is not expressible 
                              in terms of the complexities of tuples
               We have found (with logarithmic accuracy)  complexities of several problems 
           that  can  be  obtained  from  singletons  using  the  operations  Л, V, —>.  The  reader 
           can  wrongly deduce  that  complexity of every problem obtained from  singletons 
           {x},{y},...  using  these  three  operations  can  be  expressed  through  complexities 
           of x,y,..., their pairs,  triples,  etc.  (with some decent, say logarithmic,  accuracy). 
           This is not  the case.  The problem  (x —> z) A (y —> z)  (whose complexity equals 
           the maximum of C(z\x) and C(z\y), with logarithmic accuracy) is already close 
           to the border of the area where this is possible.  It turns out that the complexity 
           of a slightly general problem  (a —> c) A (b —> d)  cannot be expressed through the 
           complexities  of a, b, c, d,  their  pairs,  triples,  etc.  This  is  stated  in  Theorem  247 
           below.
               We start with several simple observations on the complexity of this problem.
                342  Prove that for all strings a, b,c, d the following inequalities  hold  (with
           logarithmic accuracy) :
                           C({a —► c) A (6 —► d)) ^ C(c\a) + C(d\b),
                           C((a —> c) A (6 —> d)) ^ C(d\b, c) + C(c),
                           C((a —>■ c) A (& —>• d)) ^ C(c\a, d) + C(d),
                           C((a —> c) A (b —>• d)) ^ C(b,c,d\a) — C(b\a,c), 
                           C((a —> c) A (6 —d)) > C(a, c,d\b) -  C(a \b,d).
                343  Problem 342 establishes three upper bounds and two lower bounds for 
           the complexity of the problem (a —> c)A (b —> d).  Prove that there exists a sequence 
           of quadruples (an, &n, cn, dn)  of strings of lengths 0 (n) such that for all n each of 
           the upper bounds is larger than each of the above lower bounds by n — 0(1).
               (Hint:  Let  a  —  d  and  b  =  c where  a,b  are  independent  random  strings  of 
           length n.)
