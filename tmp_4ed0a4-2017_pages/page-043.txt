            first remaining string (since T ^ BB(n — c) according to our assumption).  As the 
            complexity of 7n is at least n, we have n ^ C(7n) < (n — c — d) + 2 log(c + d) + 0 (1), 
            hence (c + d) = 0 (1).
                We have thus proven the equivalence of objects  (a)-(h).  It remains to prove 
            that the complexity of each of them is n + 0 (1).
                Let Xn be one of objects (a)-(h).  We have just proven that Xn can be obtained 
            from 7n+c  and n  (actually,  we do  not  need n,  as  n  =  /(7n+c) — c).  Therefore, 
            C(Xn) ^ C(ln+c) + 0(1) < n + 0(1).
                To prove the lower bound of C(Xn), let n — d be the complexity of Xn.  For 
            some constant c the string 7n_c can be obtained from the shortest description of 
            Xn of length n — d and from d (note that n can be retrieved from the length of 
            the shortest description and d).  Thus, n — c ^ C(^n-c) ^ (n — d) + 21ogd + 0(1). 
            Therefore, d ^ 2 logd + c + 0(1) and, hence, d = 0(1).                          □
                [~8~| The objects in Theorem 15 depend on the choice of the optimal decompres­
            sor.  In the proof we assumed that the same optimal decompressor is used in all the 
            items  (a)-(h).  Prove that  the statement of the theorem remains true if different 
            decompressors are used.
                [~9~| Prove that the complexity of all the objects in Theorem 15 becomes O(logn) 
            if we relativize the definition of Kolmogorov complexity by (F, that is, if we allow 
            the decompressor to query the oracle for the halting problem.
                We have seen that there exist a constant c and an algorithm A that, given the 
            string 7n,  solves  the halting problem  for  the  optimal  decompressor  on inputs of 
            length at most n — c.  This means that given an  “oracle”  that finds 7n  for every 
            given n, we can solve the halting problem.  The same can be done given an oracle 
            deciding whether a given string x is incompressible, that is, C(x) ^ l(x).  Indeed, 
            using that oracle, we can find 7n by probing all strings of length n.
                Using the terminology of computability theory,  we can say  that  the halting 
            problem is  Turing reducible to the set of incompressible strings (or its complement, 
            the  set  of compressible  strings).  This  implies  that  the  halting  problem  is  also 
            reducible to the  “upper graph”  of C, that is, to the set {(x,k)  | C(x) < к}.  Using 
            the terminology of computability theory, we say that the set of compressible strings 
            (as well as the upper graph of C) is  Turing complete in the class of enumerable sets 
            (this means that it is enumerable and that the halting problem is Turing reducible 
            to it).

            needed to solve the halting problem for a fixed machine M and for all strings of 
            length at most n.
                1111 Let  /  be a computable partial function from N to N.  Prove that there 
            is  a  constant  c such  that  for  all  n,  such  that  f(B(n))  is  defined,  the  inequality 
            B(n + c) ^ f(B(n)) is true.
                (Hint:  The complexity of f(B(n)) is at most n + 0(1).)
                 12  Call a set U r-separable  [137]  if every enumerable set V disjoint with U 
            can be separated from U by a decidable set, that is, there is a decidable set R that 
            includes V and is disjoint with U.
