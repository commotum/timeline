              208                      6.  GENERAL SCHEME FOR COMPLEXITIES
                   We can also define the prefix complexity with set  condition using prefix-free 
              functions instead of prefix-stable ones.  Again, in the class of computable prefix-free 
              functions there exists an optimal one (that gives the smallest complexity function 
              Kf(x\\A)).  In this way we get the definition of some function K'(x\\A) that re­
              sembles the conditional complexity K'(k\n) and coincides with it  (up to 0(1)) if 
              A = {n).
                   Finally  one  can  define  a  priori  probability  m(x\\A).  For  that  we  consider 
              some  probabilistic  machine  that  has  input  y  and  the  measure  of the  set  of all 
              sequences uj G  0 that  (being used as random bits)  makes the machine transform 
              every input y G A into x.  Again, there exists an optimal machine that maximizes 
              this probability  (up to an 0(l)-constant factor), and for singletons this definition 
              coincides with our definition of the conditional a priori probability.
                   The inequalities
                               -  log m(k K A) < K(k II A) + 0(1) < K'(k || A) + 0(1),
              can be proved in the same way as for conditional prefix complexity, but the argu­
              ment that showed that all three expressions coincide does not work as before.  As 
              Elena Kalinina [71] has shown, the second inequality is not an equality; we do now 
              know what happens with the first inequality.  But it is easy to see that all three 
              expressions are not less than
                                           — log inf m(k I x) — sup K{x | a),
                                                  xEA             xEA
              so each of them can be used in the theorem similar to Theorem 131.  In particular, 
              for K(x II A) (which seems to be most natural among all three) we get the following 
              result:
                   Theorem 134.
                                           lim  K(x II  ^ n) = K° (x) + 0(1).
                    208 Prove that all three quantities K(k || A), K'(k || A), and C(k || A) differ at 
              most by 0(the logarithm of the smallest one), i.e., by 0(\ogC(k || A)).
                   We do not know whether 0(x|| A) can be bounded by a linear (or even com­
              putable) function of — log m(k || A) (at least for finite A, or even for A that contains 
              only two elements).
                   Let us mention here that there is another type of problem in which the natural 
              notions of complexity and a priori probability differ significantly:  the enumeration 
              problems considered by R.  Solovay  [189].  Let us consider non-terminating algo­
              rithms whose input is a binary string.  Such an algorithm enumerates some (finite 
              or infinite) set by printing its elements one by one.  (If an algorithm starts to print 
              some output element, it is obliged to print it completely, and then it may resume 
              the computation.)  If A is an algorithm of this type and S is some enumerable set, 
              we define the complexity of S with respect to A as the minimal length of the input 
              for which A enumerates S:
                                     CEa(S) = min{l(p) I M(p) enumerates S'}.
              As usual,  it  is  easy  to  see  that  there  exists  an  optimal  algorithm  A  that  makes 
              CEa  minimal up to 0(1).  We fix an optimal A and call CEa(S) an enumeration 
              compleodty of S.  It is denoted by CE(S) and is finite if and only if S is enumerable.
