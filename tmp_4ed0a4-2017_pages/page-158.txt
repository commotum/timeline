                                          5.  MONOTONE COMPLEXITY
             144
             are bounded by 6 kck+i/2 ■  The same is true for all other even levels (with a smaller 
             value of k).
                 Therefore, the ^-strategy wins on the tree with branching factor
                       max{a/£. 0 (k2), 6 (k — 1/2)с&} = тах{а/г, 0 (k2), 2 ° ^  (    }};
             here the second term (for large к) is dominated by the third one, and we can ignore 
             it.
                 Now we can finish the proof of the Gacs-Day result.  Let d be a power of 2. 
             We need to construct  a strategy with parameters a = 1 fd and some ß  >  1 that 
             wins on some tree T with a bounded depth and branching factor.  For that,  we 
             call the strategy constructed above (sequentially for each of the sons of the root) 
             with parameters к — 2d and a = l/(4d) until the request for the root reaches the 
             dangerous level Ifd — l/(4d).  In this way we request at most 1 fd, and the grayed 
             area is  at  least  2 d(l/d — 1/(4d)) >  1.  After each  call the root  request  increases 
             at least by (3/4)(l/4d)(l/к), so the number of requests is bounded by 0(d3), and 
             0(d3) sons of the root are enough.  The subtree rooted there should be suitable for
             a 2d-strategy with parameters a = l/(4d) and £ = (1/(4d))/c^d К  This requires 
             trees of height 0 (d) and the branching factor
                                     max{C^ 3\2°W 4(fc-1,} = 2°(d)0(d\
             This finishes the proof of the Gåcs-Day result.                                     □
                  139 Prove that the height of the tree in the Gacs-Day theorem cannot be 
             less that df4:  if it is smaller, Server has a winning strategy (instead of Client).
                 Returning to the gap between KM and KA, we observe that the upper and 
             lower bounds are still significantly different:  the only upper bound known says that 
             the gap is at most O(logn) for n-bit strings (and this is true even for К instead of 
             KM).  One small improvement is that we can replace n by К A (x), as the following 
             problem shows.
                  140 Prove that KM(x) < KA (x) + 0(log KA (x)).
                 (Hint:  In fact KM(x | KA (x)) < KA (x) + 0(1).  Indeed, if KA (x) = к, then x 
             at some point appears in the growing subtree of strings whose a priori complexity 
             is  less  than  к + 1.  This  tree  at  all  times  has  width  (the  cardinality  of maximal 
             antichain) at most 2k+1, so looking at the maximal elements of this tree, we cover 
             it  by 2k+ 1  growing branches.  For details see Theorem 127, p.  194.)
                                       5.6.  Levin—Schnorr theorem
                 The definition of the a priori complexity guarantees that for any lower semi- 
             computable semimeasure p the inequality К A (x) < — logp(x) + c holds for some c 
             and for every x.  It turns out that if p is a (computable) measure, then this inequal­
             ity  is  true  not  only  for  a priori  complexity  KA  but also for a  (larger)  monotone 
             complexity KM.
                 Theorem  89.  Let p  be  a computable probability distribution on O,  and let p 
             be the corresponding function on binary strings: p(x) = p(Q.x).  Then there exists a 
             constant c such that
                                           KM(x) < — logp(:r) + c
            for every string x.
