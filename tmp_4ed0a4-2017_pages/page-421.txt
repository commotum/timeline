              the value of v.in at all.  In case (2) we do use um, but we have two reasons to believe 
              that the answer is correct (since the output of s coincides with [t. vt}), and one of 
              these two reasons still works.                                                             □
                   To prove Theorem 238, we need to make one more step and consider slightly 
              more general formulas.  Again let iq,..., Uk be a tuple of strings.  Consider several 
              (N) pairs of disjoint set of indices:
                                  h n jt = 0 ,                           1=1,...,N.
              For each I we define problems Xi and Yi as before, i.e., let Xi be the conjunction of 
              singletons щ for t G //, while Yi is the disjunction of singletons yt for t € J).  Finally, 
              let Z be the disjunction of all singletons Ui,... ,Uk-  Now consider the problem
                              ((№  —» n ) -» у,) л • • • л ((xN -> yn) -> yn)) -4 2 .
                   Theorem  244.  The complexity of this problem is not less than the minimal 
              conditional complexity of some ut relative to the tuple of all other iq,..., Uk  (with 
              0(1) -precision).
                   P r o o f.  The proof mainly repeats the previous argument.  For each I, for each 
              natural number г, and for each tuple v = (vi,... ,Vk) that coincides with щ,... ,Uk 
              except for one component, we construct a program qu(v) that solves the problem
                                                    {X^Yi)^Yh
              if d(i)  is defined and is equal to the coordinate where и and v differ, or if v = и (in 
              the latter case it is not important whether d(i)  is defined or not and what is the 
              value of d(i)).
                  For every m we consider the following algorithm that tries to reconstruct um 
              given any solution p to the problem
                              ((№  -4 U) -> П) Л • • • Л (№ v -4 Yn) -4 ВД)  -4 z
              and given all the other components of u.  We apply p to tuples (qu(v), ..., qNi(v)) 
              for all the tuples v that differ from и only in mth coordinate and all the i such that 
              d(i) = m.  If we are lucky and for some v,i the program p terminates and outputs 
              a pair [m, *] with the first component m, then the second component is um  (as we 
              wanted).
                  As  before,  the  diagonal  property  of d  is  needed  to  show  that  such  a  lucky 
              coincidence will indeed happen for some m.  More specifically, it will happen for v = 
              и and for i such that d(i) coincides with the first component of \p](qu(v), ■ ■ ■ > qNi(v)) 
              (by the diagonal property such an i does exist).                                           □
                  The propositional formulas used in this theorem are called critical implications. 
              Namely, a critical implication is a formula of the type
                             (((Pi —> Q\) —>■ Qi) Л • ■ • A ((P/v —> Q n ) —> Q n ))     P?
              where R is the disjunction of certain variables s\.... ,Sk, for each I formula Pi is a 
              conjunction of some of these variables and Qi is a disjunction of some other variables 
              (Pi and Qi have no common variables and are not empty).  Critical implications are 
              not provable in IPC; this can be easily shown using Kripke models and also follows 
              from  the  previous  theorem  (recall  that  provable  formulas  have  low  complexity). 
              It  turns out  that  critical  implications  are  universal non-provable  formulas.  More 
              precisely, the following statement is true:
