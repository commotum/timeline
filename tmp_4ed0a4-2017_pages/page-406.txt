            and
                                       Wp,q,r : Ш4 X Bp -+ B2n 
            are given.  Moreover, assume that a mapping
                                          S: B2n-2 -a B2”
            and another mapping
                                      T: B2n X Bn-21ogn   E2n 
            are given.  (The mappings Vp^q^r and Wp^q,r correspond to the moves of the (p, q, r)- 
            player on the adversary team.  Namely, strings Vp<q^T(B, X) for all possible X are 
            y-simple for В;  strings  Wp^q^T{B',X)  for all possible X  are p-simple for B'.  The 
            mappings  S' and T correspond to the moves of two additional players.  Namely, 
            S(X) are bad strings (there are 22n“2 of them), and T(B,X) are bad for В (there 
            are 2n-21ogn of them).  The bounds for the number of bad strings are now more 
           strict than in the game argument; this is needed to obtain the bounds below.)
               We say that a mapping U is covered by a quadruple V, W, S, T (which consists 
           of two families of mappings and two mappings) if for every string B G B2n and for 
           every string A that is equal to U(B,X) for some X G Bn  (for every string В and 
           for every string A that is declared by us as n-simple for В), the pair (A, В) satisfies 
           one of four conditions:
                (1)  В belongs to the range of S (i.e.,  В — S(Y) for some Y G B2n~2).  (The 
                    string В is declared bad by the adversary.)
                (2)  A belongs to the range of S (i.e., A = S(Y) for some Y G B2n~2).  (The 
                    string A is declared bad by the adversary.)
                (3)  A equals T(B,Y) for some Y G Bn-21ogn.  (The string A is declared bad 
                    for В by the adversary.)
                (4)  There exists a triple (p, q, r) G  M and some ç-bit string B' such that the 
                    following two conditions (a) and (b) are both true:
                     (a)  B' = Vp^q,r(B,Y) for some Y G Br ((p, ç, r)-player declared B' to be 
                        y-simple given B)\
                     (b)  A = Wp^ r(B', Z) for some Z G Bp ((p, ç, y)-player declared A to be 
                        p-simple given В').
               We will prove (under some conditions on the set M, see below) that there exists 
           some mapping U that is not covered by any quadruple V, W, S, T.  This proof will 
           use a probabilistic  argument:  For each quadruple we count how many mappings 
           are covered  by it  (i.e.,  we  compute the probability  for  a random mapping to be 
           covered by a given quadruple), then we multiply this probability by the number of 
           quadruples and show that the product is less than 1.
               The counting for one quadruple goes as follows.  Assume that  V. W, S, T are 
           fixed.  There are at  least  22n_1  strings В of length 2n that violate condition  (1). 
           For the set  U to be covered,  it is needed that for each of these В each of the 2n 
           values A = U(B,X)  (for all n-bit X) is covered by one of the conditions  (2)-(4). 
           We will show that for a given В  and X the probability of this event  is at  most 
           1/ 2.  Then, by independence, we conclude that for a random U the probability to 
           be covered is at most     (1/2)22"-1*2'1 = (1/2)23""1 
           Let us check the estimate for given В and X.  Unsuitable A include the following:
                  •  strings covered by (2), at most 22n-2 of them;
                  •  strings covered by (3), at most 2n-21ogn of them;
