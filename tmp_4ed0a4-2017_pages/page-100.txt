                         4.4.  A  DIGRESSION:  MACHINES  WITH  SELF-DELIMITING  INPUT          85
                    •  Like plain complexity, prefix complexity does not increase when algorith­
                      mic transformation is applied:
                                         A'(A(x))^ A'(x) + 0(1).
                      The constant  0(1)  depends on A but does not depend on x.  Indeed,  if 
                      О is a prefix-free decompressor, then so is the composition x    A(D(x)). 
                      This is true for prefix-stable decompressors as well, so we obtain a similar 
                      statement for К in place of K'.  Using this property, we can define prefix 
                      complexity of other constructive objects, such as pairs of strings, natural 
                      numbers, finite sets of strings etc., without specifying how to encode them 
                      by binary strings.
                    •  For prefix complexity, the inequality comparing the complexity of a pair 
                      of strings with their separate complexities is true up to a constant additive 
                      error term rather than a logarithmic one:
                                       K(x,y)tZK(x) + K(y) + 0( 1)
                      (see below Theorem 60 in Section 4.6, p. 97).
                    •  Let D be an optimal decompressor (from the definition of plain complex­
                      ity).  Since the the transformation р и  D{p) does not increase complexity, 
                      we have
                             К(D{p))  <   K(p) + 0(1) «  l(p) + 2 log Z(p) +  0(1).
                      Let p be a shortest description of x with respect to D, that is, D(p) = x 
                      and l(p) = C(x).  Then we have
                                 K(x) = K(D(p)) < l(p) + 21ogl(p) + 0(1)
                                       = C(x) + 21og C(x) + 0(1).
                      Using stronger bounds in place of the bound K(p) < l(p)+2 log l(p)+0(1), 
                      we obtain the inequality
                              К(x) ^ C(x) + log C(x) + 2 log log C(x) + 0(1)
                      and other similar inequalities.
                      4.4.  A digression:  Machines with self-delimiting input
                This  section  is  not  used  in  the  sequel;  here  we  analyze  the  meaning  of the 
            words “self-delimited input” and show that a different interpretation of them leads 
            to  prefix-free  and  prefix-stable  functions  (thus  providing  a  motivation  for  these 
            notions).
                Usually the input is given to a machine in such a way that the machine knows 
            where the input string starts and ends.  For example, for Turing machines we usually 
            assume that initially the head is located at the first symbol of the input string and 
            that its last symbol is followed be a special marker, say, a blank.
                Informally speaking,  a machine with a self-delimited input receives the input 
            bits one by one and has no indication which of them is the last one.  At a certain 
            time it should print a result and halt.
