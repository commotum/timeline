                                        5.6.  LEVIN-SCHNORR THEOREM                             151
             that are equal to a and are placed in incompatible vertices.  Every lower semicom- 
             putable function can be represented up to a 0 (l)-factor as the sum t(oj) —    tk{u>),
             where tj.c(w) = 2k if t(ui) > 2k and tk(oo) = 0 otherwise.  If all tk are represented as 
             explained above, all the summands in the formula for the deficiency are powers of 
             two.  Then the sum equals the supremum up to a 0(l)-factor.  See [13] for details.)
                 The statement of the last problem was proved in an old paper by Gåcs [56].  The 
             proof gives as a byproduct the statement of Problem 146 rediscovered independently 
             in a more recent paper by J. Miller and L. Yu [123] under the name of “ample excess 
             lemma”.
                  148  (a)  Let  w  be  an  ML-random  sequence  with  respect  to  a  computable 
             measure p,,  and let p(x)  = p(£lx).  Prove that the difference — logp(x) — K(x)  is 
             not only bounded from above for prefixes of ш but also tends to —oo as the length 
             of the prefix increases.  In other words, if K(x) ^ — logp(æ) + c for some c and for 
             infinitely many prefixes x of cu, the cu is not ML-random.
                 (b) Prove that if K(x) < — logp(æ) + log/(x) + c for some c and for all prefixes 
             X  of oj,  then w  is not ML-random.
                 (Hint:  In both cases use the ample excess lemma, Problem 146.)
                 The case of uniform measure is rather important; let us write down all that we 
             have proven for this case:
                 Theorem 94.  (a)  Upper bound:
                                   KA (x) < KM(x) + 0(1) ^ l(x) + 0(1)
             for any string x.
                 (b)  Randomness  criterion:  the sequence ш  is  ML-random with respect to  the 
             uniform measure if and only if these inequalities become equalities for prefixes ofuj,
                                 KA ((w)n) = KM((w)n) + 0(1) = n + 0(1).
                 (c)  If и  is not ML-random with respect to uniform measure, then the difference 
             n — КМ((ш)п)  (and therefore n — KA ((w)n)  tends to infinity as n —>■ oo.
                 (d)  The sequence oo  is ML-random with respect to the uniform measure if and 
             only if К((ш)п) ^ n — c for some c and for all n.
                 (e)  The sequence oo  is ML-random with respect to the uniform measure if and 
             only if К (F,uj(F)) ^ IF I — c for some c and for all finite sets F.
                 Another version of the statement (d) is that a sequence ш is ML-random if and 
             only if the sum     2n_A'((a;)0  is finite (Problem 146).
                 For the case of uniform measure there exists one more criterion of Martin-Löf 
             randomness.  It is interesting since it uses only plain complexity (and not the prefix 
             or monotone versions).  It is a bit strange that this criterion was discovered only 
             recently (see [123]) since similar suggestions were considered at the end of the 1960s 
             (see  [225,  117]),  and the proof of this criterion uses only ideas and methods that 
             were well known at that time.
                 Theorem 95.  Assume that f: N —> N is a computable total function and the 
             series           converges.  Let ш  be  an ML-random sequence with respect to  the
             uniform measure.  Then
                                        C((w)n\n) ^ n -  f(n) -  0(1)
