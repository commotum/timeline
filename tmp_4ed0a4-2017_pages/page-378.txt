                 Figure 38.  The simplest information transmission request
            We are interested in the conditions that make a request (actually, a sequence 
         of requests) fulfillable.
            Consider a network that has two nodes and one edge (Figure 38).  Let us agree 
         that all edges are directed top-down, so the direction arrows are omitted.  The top 
         node is an input node and has input string A; the bottom node is an output node 
         and has output string B.  The channel has capacity k.
            In other words, for given strings A and В we are looking for a string X (trans­
         mitted message) such that
                        C(X\A)^0,  C(B |X)«0,  l(X)^k.
         Obviously, it is possible only if C(B \ A) ~ 0 and C(B) ^ к (the latter inequality is 
         understood also with logarithmic precision).  On the other hand, these conditions 
         are also sufficient because we may use the shortest description for B as X.
            To express this evident idea formally, we (unfortunately) need a rather obscure 
         statement.  Let An  and Bn  be sequences of strings,  and let kn  be  a sequence of 
         integers.  Assume  that  the  lengths  of An  and  Bn  as  well  as  the  integer  kn  are 
         bounded by a polynomial in n.  Then the following two properties are equivalent:
            (1)  there  exists  a  sequence  of strings  Xn  such  that  l(Xn)  ^  kn + O(logn), 
         C(Xn\An) = O(logn), and C(Bn\Xn) = O(logn);
            (2)  C(Bn I An) = O(logn) and C(Bn) O n  + O(logn).
            This equivalence follows from two (rather trivial) remarks.  First,
                    C(B I A) ^ C(B IX) + C(X I A) + О (log C(A, B,X)),
                       C(B) ^ l(X) + C(B IX) + О (log C(B IX)) 
         for all strings A,B,X (so (1) implies (2)).  Second,
                for every A, В and к there exists a string X such that 
                     l(X) ^ C(B),C(X\A) ^ C(B\A) + 0(\ogC(B)), 
                and C(B\X) = 0(1)
         (let X be the shortest program for B) and therefore (1) follows from (2).
            For the case A = B, the statement has clear intuitive meaning:  a string A can 
         be transmitted through a communication channel if and only if its complexity does 
         not exceed the capacity of the channel.
            Let us now switch to more interesting examples.
                            12.2.  Conditional encoding
            In the following request we want to transmit some string A assuming that both 
         the sender and the receiver know some string В  (Figure 39).  We need to encode 
         A by a k-bit string, send this string down, and then decode A back; both encoder
