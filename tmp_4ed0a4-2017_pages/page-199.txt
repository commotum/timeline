                      5.9.  RANDOMNESS WITH  RESPECT TO  DIFFERENT MEASURES         185
                186 Give a direct proof of Theorem 123(b) using the definition of an effectively
           null set.
               (Hint:  For a given e consider the family of intervals Z£ that covers the largest 
           effectively //-null set and has total /u-measure less than e\ let F be the (closed) set 
           of non-covered sequences.  All sequences in F are random,  so  /  is defined  (=has 
           infinite sequences  as images)  and continuous on F.  The image of a compact set 
           F is a compact set and therefore is closed.  It has measure at least 1 — e, since its 
           preimage contains F.  Its complement is an open set that has measure at most s 
           and covers all the points that do not have preimages in F.  The only problem is 
           that one should prove an effective version of the theorem that says that the image 
           of a compact set under a continuous mapping is compact,  and conclude that the 
           complement to /-image of F is not only an open set, but a uniformly effectively 
           open set.)
               A similar argument allows us to prove a quantitative version of the statement 
           Theorem 123(b) saying that the bound provided by Problem 185 is tight:  the expec­
           tation-bounded /'-deficiency of uj equals (up to an 0 (1) additive term) the infimum 
           of expectation-bounded //-deficiencies of all /-preimages of uj.  See  [15]  for more 
           detail.
               I  187 I  Prove  a statement  that  can  be  considered  as  a finitary version  of the 
           statement (a) of Theorem 123:  if и and w are binary strings such that и ^ f(w), 
           then
                                dv{u) ^ dß{w) + 21ogdß{w) + 0 (1).
               (Hint:  The set  of sequences having large  /'-deficiencies  can be covered  by  a 
           set of small /'-measure, therefore their preimages can be covered by a set of small 
           //-measure and have large //-deficiency.  Note that this statement is a generalization 
           of Theorem 124.)
               Theorem 123 has some (rather surprising) applications.  Here is an example:
                188      Let со be an ML-random sequence with respect to the Bernoulli distri­
           bution  (independent  coin tosses)  where  1  has probability  1/3.  Prove that  there 
           exists a sequence uj'  that is random with respect to the uniform distribution (1 has 
           probability 1/2) and can be obtained from со by replacing some zeros by ones.
               (Hint:  Consider  an  ML-random sequence of independent  random reals uni­
           formly distributed in  [0,1],  or,  better to say,  the random sequence of bits placed 
           in  a two-dimensional table where  (infinite)  rows are considered as infinite binary 
           fractions.  Then  convert  this  sequence  into  a  bit  sequence  using  threshold  2/3. 
           Theorem 123 guarantees that we get an ML-random sequence with respect to the 
           1/3-Bernoulli distribution and that any ML-random sequence with respect to this 
           distribution can be obtained in this way.  Then we can change the threshold to 1/2.)
               Another corollary of Theorem 123 and its generalizations are discussed in the 
           next section.
               5.9.4.  Michiel  van  Lambalgen’s  theorem.  Consider  a probabilistic  ma­
           chine that tosses a fair coin to get a sequence ujquj\uj2 ■ • ■  and then outputs every 
           other bit,  i.e.,  the sequence ujquj2UJ^ • ■ ■ ;  the output distribution of this machine is 
           uniform.  Theorem 123 for this machine therefore implies the following:
               (a) if ujquj\uj2 ■ • •  is ML-random with respect to the uniform Bernoulli measure, 
           then ujquj2UJ$ • ■ ■  is ML-random with respect to the same measure;
