                              GENERALIZATION  FOR ARBITRARY COMPUTABLE DISTRIBUTIONS                                       485

                                                                      11

                Then a set  is  considered  effectively  large  with  respect  to  p  if its  complement  is 
                effectively small.
                      For every computable measure p the following Martin-Löf theorem holds:  the 
                union of all effectively small sets is effectively small, and therefore the intersection 
                of all  effectively  large  sets  is  effectively  large.  This  result  provides  the  smallest 
                effectively  large  set  which  is  called  the  constructive  support  of measure  p.  The 
                elements of this constructive support are called typical with respect to p, so the set 
                T(p) is defined as the constructive support of the distribution p.
                      Unpredictability.  Let us explain how the definition of unpredictability (given 
                above for the uniform distribution) should be changed for the case of arbitrary dis­
                tributions.  Two changes are necessary for that:  some auxiliary factor (that equals 
                1 for the uniform distribution and was therefore omitted), and some additional rule 
                that tells us when to stop the game (for the uniform distribution it is not needed 
                since the corresponding situation cannot happen).
                      The payoff for bets depends on the probability distribution.  If Player makes a 
                wrong guess, her bet is lost, i.e., the capital decreases by the size of the bet.  But if 
                she makes a correct guess, the increase is proportional to the bet, and the coefficient 
                depends on the probability of the correctly predicted outcome.  The coefficient is 
                large if this outcome has small probability, and is small if it has large probability. 
                For uniform distribution the probability is always 1/2 and the coefficient is always 1. 
                The exact  value of the  coefficient  for  an  arbitrary  distribution  is  determined  as 
                follows.
                      Recall that ад-  denotes the kth. term of a sequence a; similarly,  alk  is the kth 
                term of a', etc.  Player’s j th move is a triple (n(j), i(j), v(j)).
                     Let a be the sequence used by Casino for the game.  Let
                                A(k — 1) = ja' G Г2: a'n^  = an^  for all j — 1,2 ..., к - 1}
                (so A(0) = Г2) and
                                        Ai{k) = ja' G A(k — 1) : a'n^  = i} for i = 0,1.
                This notation makes sense if all the numbers n{l) appearing in it are defined.  Note 
                that
                (1)                               Г2 = A(0) D A{ 1) D A(2) D • • •  ,
                ( 2)                        1 = p{A{0)) ÿ д(Л(1)) ÿ ß(A(2)) > • • • .
                If Player’s fcth guess was correct, then
                (3)                               i(k)     dn(fc))    -^i(fc)(^0 — ^(^)i
                otherwise
                (4)                             i(k) ф an{k),       Ai_i^(k) = A(k).
