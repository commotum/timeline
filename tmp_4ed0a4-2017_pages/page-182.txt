                      Figure  14.  Two series with the same sum can be obtained by a 
                      different  grouping from the same third series.
             have cAi  ^ m{i) for all sufficiently large i, so a,ij/rh(i, j)  ^  1 jc for all sufficiently 
             large i  (and only finitely many pairs  (i,j)  violate this requirement,  because each 
             Ai has only finitely many non-zero terms).  So for each c we have constructed some 
             semimeasure mc such that aij/mc{i,j) ^ 1/c for almost all pairs (i,j), and the sum 
             Ylij^cihj) is at most ^2m(i) ^ 1.  It remains to perform this construction for all 
             c = 22n and combine the resulting m22n with coefficients 2~n.                         □
                  As a corollary of Theorem 112 we see (in an alternative way) that the Solovay 
             property depends only on the sum of the series.  Indeed,  if                   bj,  these
             two series could be obtained by a different grouping of terms in some third series
                 Cfc.  To construct Cfc, we draw intervals of lengths a\, a,2, ■ ■ ■ starting from zero 
             point, as well as the intervals of lengths bi, 62,...; combined endpoints split the line 
             into intervals of lengths ci, C2,...  (see Figure 14).
                 In  this  way  we  get  not  only  the  alternative  invariance  proof,  but  also  can 
             strengthen Theorem 111, which dealt with computable series of rational numbers. 
             Now we still consider series of rational numbers, but the summands are presented 
             as  lower  semicomputable numbers  and each has only finitely  many different  ap­
             proximations.  (So  ri  —  \imnr(i,n),  where  r  is  a computable  function  of i  and 
             n with rational values which is non-decreasing as a function of n and for every i 
             there are only finitely many different values r(i,n).)  Then the number           *s n°t
             ML-random if and only if Ti/m(i) —> 0.  Indeed, each         is  a sum of a computable 
             series of non-negative rational numbers with only finitely many non-zero terms.  So 
             we can split        into  a double series not  changing the sum  (evidently)  and the 
             Solovay property (due to Theorem 112).
                 Recall that an upper semicomputable function n 1—> f(n) with integer values is 
             an upper bound for K(n)  (up to an 0 (1) additive term)  if and only if          2“-^n) 
             is finite (Theorem 62, p.  100).  Now we can extend this statement:
                 Theorem 113.  This bound is tight for infinitely many n (i.eK (n) ^ f(n) — c 
             for some c and for infinitely many n)  if and only if the sum                  random.
                 P roof.  Indeed,  decreasing integer upper bounds for f(n)  provide increasing 
             lower  bounds  for  2“^"^  (with  finitely  many  changes),  so  we  use  the  preceding 
             result.                                                                               □
                 We end this section with an alternative proof that all complete reals have the 
             Solovay property.  First we observe that the Solovay property is upward closed with 
             respect to Solovay reducibility.  Indeed, if    ai  and    bi  are computable series of 
             non-negative rational numbers and ai converges slowly, then Yl(ai + ^) converges 
             slowly also (its terms are bigger).  So it remains to prove directly that at least one 
             slowly converging series (or, in other words, a computable Solovay function) exists. 
             It can be done as shown in Problem 164.  Another way to explain this construction 
             is  that  we watch how the values of a priori probability increase  (it  is convenient
