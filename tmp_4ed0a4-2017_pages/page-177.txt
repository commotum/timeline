                                                                   5.7.   THE  RANDOM  NUMBER П                                                             163
                     h and for ß we expect increase k, then for a + ß we predict increase h + к.)  But 
                     this simple argument does not work.  The problem is that the same prediction for a 
                     can be combined with many predictions for ß and therefore will be counted many 
                     times in the sum.
                            The solution is to make predictions for a and ß of the same size.  Let ai  and 
                     bi  be computable increasing sequences that converge to a and ß.  Since a and ß 
                     are non-random,  they are covered by sequences of intervals that have small total 
                     measure.  To make a prediction for the sequence ai + bi (after the previous prediction 
                    became invalid), we wait until the current approximations cq and bi become covered 
                    by the intervals of those sequences.  We take then the maximal h and к such that 
                     (ai, ai + h)  and  (bi,bi + к)  are entirely covered  (by the unions of already known 
                    intervals).  The prediction interval is declared to be  (a* + bi, ai + bi + 28)  where 
                    8 = min(h, k).
                           Let us show that one of the predictions will remain valid forever.  Indeed, the 
                    limit  values  a  and  ß  are  covered  by  some  intervals.  These  intervals  appear  in 
                    the sequences at some point and cover a and ß with some neighborhoods, say, o- 
                    neighborhoods.  If the prediction is made after a* and bi enter these neighborhoods, 
                    8 is greater than a and the prediction is final:  a* + bi  never increases more than 
                    by 28.
                           It remains to bound the sum of all 8 used during the prediction.  It can be done 
                    using the following observation.  When a prediction interval (a* + £>*, a* + Ь* + 28) 
                    becomes invalid, this means that either ai or bi has increased by 8 or more, so the 
                    total measure of the covers on the right of a*  and bi  has decreased at least by 8. 
                    Here we use that (a*, a* + 8) and (bi, bi + 8) are covered completely because 8 does 
                    not exceed both h and k.  It is important here that we take the minimum.                                                                 □
                           Let us return to the criterion for randomness provided by Theorem 105.  The 
                    condition for non-randomness given there can be weakened in two aspects.  First, we 
                    can replace computable sequence by a lower semicomputable sequence, and second, 
                    we can replace hi by the entire tail hi + hi+i + • • •  of the corresponding series, as 
                    follows.
                           Theorem 108.  Let ai be an increasing computable sequence of rational numbers 
                    that converges to a.  Assume that for every rational £ > 0  one can effectively find 
                    a lower semicomputable sequence hi  of non-negative reals such that                                                       hi < e  and 
                    a ^ ai + hi + hi+i + • • •  for some i.  Then a is not random.
                           Proof.  Assume that for every i there is a painter who gets hi units of paint 
                    and instructions to paint the real line starting at ai, going to the right, and skipping 
                    the parts already painted by other painters (but making no other gaps).  (Since hi is 
                    only semicomputable, the paint is provided incrementally and is used as soon as it 
                    becomes available.)  The painted zone is a union of an enumerable family of intervals 
                    of total measure                  hi (the total amount of paints).  If a < ai + hi + hi+1 + • ■ •, then 
                    a is painted since we cannot use hi + hi+1 + • • •  units of paint, starting between 
                    ai  and a  (recall that all aк  are less than a:)  and not crossing a:  by construction, 
                    we never cover the same point by several layers of paint.  (In the condition of the 
                    theorem we have ^ instead of <, but this does not matter since we can increase all 
                         to,  say, twice their original value.  For the same reason it is not important that 
                    hi
                    we covered a by closed intervals instead of open ones.)                                                                                 □
