              166
                   PROOF.  Assume that Tijm{i) —» 0.  Then for every e we can let hi =  em{i) and 
              get a lower semicomputable sequence that satisfies the conditions of Theorem 108. 
              Therefore a is not random.
                   We can also prove that a is not complete (thus providing an alternative proof 
              of its  non-randomness).  Recall the argument used in the proof of Theorem  103: 
              if n  ^  m(i),  then  Y2ri  =$i              And if ri  ^  cm{i),  then  Yhri  ==*c
              This remains true if the inequality r* ^ cm{i) is true for all sufficiently large i.  So 
              for a fast (non-Solovay) converging series and its sum a we have a =<IC               rn(i) for 
              arbitrarily small c.  If a were complete, we would have also ^  m{i) =4.d ot for some 
              d and therefore a  =$cd  a for some d and all c >  0.  For small enough c we have 
              cd  <  1/2  and therefore a  =<h/2  a,  he.,  2a:      er,  so  the  difference  a — 2a  =  —a
              is lower semicomputable and a is computable.  (One could note also that for each 
              approximation to a from below we can find a twice better one, and we can iterate 
              this procedure.)
                   It  remains  to  show the reverse  implication.  Assuming that a  =                is  not 
              random, we need to prove that i'i/m(i) —» 0.  Consider the interval [0, a] split into 
              intervals of length ro,r\,...  (from left to right).  Given an open cover of a with 
              small measure, we consider those intervals (of length ro, r\,..., see above) that are 
              completely covered  (endpoints included).  They form an enumerable set and the 
              sum of their lengths does not exceed the measure of the cover.  If the cover has 
              measure 2~2n for some n, we may multiply the corresponding ri by 2n and their 
              sum remains at most  2~n.  Note also that for large enough i  the ith interval is 
              covered (since it is close to a and a is covered).  So for each n we get a semimeasure 
              Mn such that  Mn(i)fri  ^  2n  for  all  sufficiently  large  i  and  J2iMn(i)  ^  2~n. 
              Taking the sum of all Mn, we get a lower semicomputable semimeasure M such 
              that ri/M(i) —>■ 0.  Then ri/m(i) —> 0 also for the universal semimeasure m.                 □
                   This result provides a (third) proof that a sum of two non-random lower semi­
              computable reals is non-random (since the sum of two sequences that converge to 0 
              also converges to 0).
                   It  shows also that  Solovay functions exist  (which is not immediately obvious 
              from the definition).  Moreover, it shows that there exist computable non-decreasing 
              Solovay functions:  take a computable series of rational numbers with random sum 
              and make this series non-increasing not  changing the  sum  (by  splitting too  big 
              terms into small pieces).
                    164         Let  U be  an optimal prefix-free decompressor.  Consider the function 
              /(p, X, n) that is equal to l(p) if U produces output x on input p making exactly n 
              steps, and (say) 2Z(p) + 2l{x) + 21ogn otherwise.  Prove that /(р,т,п) is an upper 
              bound for K(p,x,n) and this bound is tight when p is the shortest description of 
              x that needs n steps to process,  and give an alternative proof of the existence of 
              Solovay functions.
                   It also implies that slow convergence (in the Solovay sense) is not a property of 
              a series itself, but only of its sum.  It looks strange:  some property of a computable 
              series  (of non-negative rational numbers), saying that infinitely many terms come 
              close to  the  upper bound provided by the  a priori probability,  depends only on the 
              sum of this series.  At first,  it seems that by splitting the terms into small parts 
              we can destroy the property not changing the sum, but it is not so.  In the next
