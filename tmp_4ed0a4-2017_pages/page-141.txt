                                        5.4.  COMPUTABLE MAPPINGS  OF TYPE E -> E                                    127
               mapping of the set  E  (of all finite and infinite sequences of zeros and ones)  into 
               itself.  Let us stress that we consider mappings that are defined everywhere on E; 
               however, some of their values can be equal to the empty string Л (that represents 
               an undefined value in some sense).
                     5.4.1.  Continuous mappings of type E —» E.  Let /: E —> E be a mapping 
               defined on the entire  E.  We say that  /  is  continuous  if it  has the following two 
               properties:
                     (1)  /  is monotone:  if x G  E is a prefix of some y G  E, then /(x)  is a prefix of
               /Ы-
                     (2)  The value f(uj)  for an infinite sequence cj is the least upper bound of the 
               values /(x) on all finite prefixes x of the sequence cj.
                    We use the notation x =4 y for the relation  “x is a prefix of y" ; here x, y G  E 
               may be finite or infinite.  We have x ^ x for any x; if x ^ y for an infinite sequence 
               x, then x — y.  Requirement (1) says that /  is monotone with respect to the partial 
               order =<! on E.  This requirement guarantees that the values /(x) for all finite prefixes 
               x of some sequence to are compatible  (extend each other);  their  “union”  (—least 
               upper bound under ^-ordering) coincides with /(oi) due to (2).
                      132          Show that the notion of continuity defined above is the standard conti­
               nuity notion with respect to the topology on E defined in Section 4.4.3 (p. 89).
                     (Hint:  A very similar notion of continuous mappings E —> Nx was studied in 
               the same section.)
                    Let /: E        E be a continuous mapping.  Consider the set Гf that consists of 
               all pairs  (x,y)  of binary strings x and у such that y =4 /(x).  (The set Гf  may be 
               called the lower graph of the mapping /.)
                    For any continuous /  : E —» E, the set Г/ has the following three properties:
                     (1)  (x, Л)  G  Г/  for every string x;
                     (2)  If (x, y)  G  Vf,  then  (x', y')  G  Г f  for every x'    x and y' ^ y.
                     (3) If (x, y\) and (x, yf) belong to Г/, then the strings y\ and г/2 are compatible 
               (one of them is a prefix of another one).
                    The first two properties are obvious.  The third one is true since any two prefixes 
               of a (finite or infinite) sequence are compatible.
                    The following theorem shows that a continuous mapping is defined uniquely by 
               its lower graph.
                    Theorem 81.  The mapping f                   Г/  is  a  one-to-one  correspondence  between 
               continuous functions of type E —> E  and sets of pairs of strings that satisfy condi­
               tions  (l)-(3).
                    Proof.  Let /  be a set of pairs satisfying conditions (l)-(3).  These conditions 
               guarantee that for any string x the set Fx of all у such that (x, y) G F is non-empty 
               and every yi,y2  £  Fx  are compatible.  Let /(x)  be the least upper bound of Fx. 
               Property (2) guarantees that x =4 x' implies /(x) ^ f(x')  (since Fx increases as x 
               increases).  Therefore we may define f(cj) as the union (least upper bound) of /(x) 
               for all strings x ^ oj.  Then the mapping /  is continuous.  It is easy to check that 
               we get a mapping which is an inverse mapping to the correspondence /  (->• Гf.  □
                    A continuous mapping / : E —» E is called computable if the corresponding set 
               Г/ is enumerable.  (By definition all computable mappings are continuous.)
