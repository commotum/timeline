                                         5.7.  THE  RANDOM  NUMBER fi                           159
                 Theorem 101.  a =^i ß if and only if ß — a is lower semicomputable  (or,  said 
             otherwise,  if and only if ß = a + p for some lower semicomputable real p).
                 Proof.  To show the equivalence, note first that for every two lower semicom­
             putable reals a and p we have a =<h  a + p.  Indeed, consider approximations (an) 
             to a,  (rn)  to p.  Now, given a rational s < a + p, we wait for a stage n such that 
             an + rn  > s.  Setting cp(s)  = an,  it is easy to check that ip is a suitable reduction 
             function witnessing a =^i a + p.
                 It remains to prove the reverse implication:  if a =<h ß,  then p = ß — a is lower 
             semicomputable.  Indeed, let (bn) be a computable approximation (from below) for 
             ß,  and  let  ip  be  the  reduction  function  that  witnesses  a  =<h  ß.  Then  all  terms 
             bn — ip(bn)  are less than or equal to ß — a and converge to ß — a.  (The sequence 
             bn — ip(bn) may not be increasing, but still its limit is lower semicomputable, since 
             all  its  terms  do  not  exceed  the  limit,  and  we  may  replace  the  nth  term  by  the 
             maximum of the first n terms.)                                                      □
                 Here  is  a  special  case:  Let  Y lui  and  Y lvi  be  computable  series  with  non­
             negative rational terms (for i > 0; terms no and no are starting points and may be 
             negative) that converge to (lower semicomputable) a and ß.  If щ ^ n* for all i > 0, 
             then a =<h ß, since ß — a = £Т(п* — щ) is lower semicomputable.
                 The reverse statement is also true:  if a     ß, one can find computable series
             J2ui  = a and Yhvi  = ß with these properties  (0  ^  щ  ^  Vi  for i  >  0).  Indeed, 
             ß  =  a + p for  lower  semicomputable  p\  take  a  =  Y lui  and  p  =      and  let
             Vi = Щ + r».
                  162 Show that a stronger statement is also true:  not only can the series щ be
             chosen arbitrarily (see the argument above), but the same is true for n*.  Namely, 
             if a =4i  ß = ^2 Vi, where V{  ^ 0, then there exists a representation a = Ylui such 
             that 0 ^ щ ^ Vi for every i > 0.  (All series are computable.)
                 (Hint:  Construct щ sequentially maintaining the following invariant relation: 
             the current approximation A = )Cj<z из      a    below a and at least as close (to a) 
             as the current approximation В = Ylj^Vj  (to ß).  Initially, we choose щ applying 
            the reduction function to Vo.  When the current approximation becomes B' — B+Vi, 
            we apply the reduction function to get A', which is at least as close to a as B' is 
            to ß.  Then there are several cases:
                 (1) If A' < A, we let щ = 0, and the next approximation is A (it is close enough 
            by assumption).
                 (2)  If A  ^  A'  ^  A + Vi,  we let  щ  =  A! — A;  the condition guarantees  that
            Щ ^ Vi.
                 (3) Finally, if A' > A + Vi, we let щ = v%  (the invariant remains valid since the 
            distances to a and ß are decreased by the same amount).)
                 Let a be a lower semicomputable but not computable real.  By the results of 
            the previous section, one has
                                            Q.    2o:   3<У     • • •
            because for all к the difference (к + 1 )a — ka = a is lower semicomputable.  The 
            reverse relations are not true, because ka — (k + 1 )a — —a is not lower semicom­
            putable (if it were, then a would be computable).
                 One may argue that this relation is therefore a bit too sharp.  For example, a 
            and 2a have essentially the same binary expansion (just shifted by one position),
