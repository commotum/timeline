                                                               3.5.   RANDOMNESS  DEFICIENCIES                                                             71
                           Theorem 38.  A set A is an effectively null set with respect to a measure p if 
                    and only if A G (~)n Un for some uniformly effectively open sets Un  with p{Un)  ^ 
                    2~n.  We may assume also that U\ D U2 D • • ■ ■
                           Speaking about uniformly effectively open sets, we mean that there exists an 
                    algorithm that, given n, enumerates a family of intervals whose union is Un.
                           Proof.  There are several differences between this definition and the one we 
                    used earlier.  The first difference (a trivial one) is that we use only e = 2~n.
                           Second, we speak here about the measure of an effectively open set, not about 
                    the sum of measures of intervals whose union it is.  This does not matter either, since 
                    we may assume without loss of generality that the intervals forming an effectively 
                    open set are disjoint.  (When a new interval appears, we subtract all the intervals 
                    that  appeared  earlier  and  split  the  rest  into  a  union  of disjoint  intervals.)  For 
                    disjoint intervals the sum of measures is equal to the measure of their union.
                           Finally,  we  require  that  Ui+1  С                               To  achieve  this,  we  can  consider  the 
                    sequence U\,U\ П [/2, U\ П U2 П [/3,...  instead of the original one.  One needs to 
                    check only that the intersection of a finite number of effectively open sets U\C\- • -C\U\ 
                    is an effectively open set (and the corresponding algorithm can be effectively found 
                    given  the  algorithms  for  Ui).  Indeed,  assume that  we  have  two  algorithms  that 
                    enumerate intervals for U\  and U2.  At every stage the current approximations for 
                    U\  and U2 are finite unions of intervals, and their intersection is also a finite union 
                    of intervals.  Let us add all the intervals of this intersection to the enumerable set 
                    of intervals for U\ П U2.  (We can also make the intervals for U\ П U2 disjoint, see 
                    above.)                                                                                                                                □
                           In fact,  Martin-Löf gave his definition of randomness in this form in  [115];  a 
                    family Un with these properties was called a randomness test.  Given such a test, 
                    we can define the randomness  deficiency of a sequence oj  as the maximal i such 
                    that ш G Ui.  The randomness deficiency of a sequence uj is infinite when uj belongs 
                    to all Ui.  In this version, the test not only says that all elements of                                               Ui are non- 
                    random,  but also says for other sequences how close they are to non-randomness 
                    (the deficiency increases as the sequence get closer).
                           We know that there exists a universal test such that the set fji Ui is maximal. 
                    Martin-Löf noted that one can construct a test that is universal even in a stronger 
                    sense:
                           Theorem 39.  There exists a randomness test that corresponds to the maximal 
                    deficiency function  {up to an additive constant).
                           Proof.  In fact  we just  need to  look more closely at  the construction given 
                    above:  randomness tests
