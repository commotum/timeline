            The internal  sum  is  a  geometric  sequence.  Our  assumptions  guarantee  that  its 
            common ratio is less than 1/2,  so the sum is bounded by 2 times the first term, 
            and this term does not depend on t.  So we get the upper bound

            and it is less than 1 according to our assumption.  The lemma is proven.
                We will use this lemma for e = 1/8.  In this case the condition can be rewritten
            as
                                           n2N+2n+i < 8n / 2
            or
                                      logn + N + 2n + 1 < 2>N/2.
            We can let N — 6n, and this guarantees that the condition of the lemma is true for 
            all sufficiently large n.
                Now we are ready to continue the proof of Theorem 235.  As before, we replace 
            C by its  shortest  (unconditional)  description,  so  we  assume  that  C  is  an  n-bit 
            string.  (The complexity of A and В is irrelevant; in particular, these complexities 
            may exceed n.)  Let us apply the lemma with N = 6n and e = 1/8; it provides 6n 
            mappings Хь • • • ,Хбп:         with specified properties.  As usual, we can take
            the first  (in some natural ordering) family with these properties (for a given value 
            of n), so we may assume that the complexity of the family x?: is O(logn).
                Assume that C(C\ A) = к and C(C\B) = I.  (The assumption only guarantees 
            the inequalities  C(C\A)  ^  к  and C{C\B)  ^  I.  But  we can decrease  к  and I  if 
            needed, and the statement becomes only stronger.)  Taking к (or I) first bits of the 
            hash values, we get N (= 6n) mappings Bn —>     (the same for I).  These families 
            define bipartite graphs in Шп x Шк and  x Ш1 where each left vertex has degree N 
            (including multiple edges).  Then we restrict these graphs on Sa and Sb, where Sa 
            consists of n-bit strings that have complexity at most к given A, and Sb  consists 
            of n-bit strings that have complexity at most I given B.  In Шк we note bad vertices 
            that have more than nc neighbors in Sa ; in Ш1 we note bad vertices that have more 
            than nc neighbors in Sb-  (The value of a sufficiently large constant c will be chosen 
            later.)
                In both cases the number of bad vertices in bounded by
                               2N ■ 2k/nc (for Efc) and 2N ■ 2l/nc(îor В4),
            since (a) the degree of a bad vertex exceeds nc; (b) the total number of edges in the 
            restricted graphs is bounded by |£/i| • N and \Sb \ • N, respectively; (c)  |£/i| < 2 • 2 k 
            and \SB\ < 2 -2l.
                Now, implementing our plan, we say that a vertex in Sa is bad if at least half 
            of its neighbors in the graph in Sa  x Шк  (multiple edges are counted several times) 
            are bad.  The lemma guarantees that the number of bad vertices in Sa is less than 
            2N • 2k/nc (we assume that c is large enough, so the bound for the number of bad
