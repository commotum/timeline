                                        2.1.  COMPLEXITY OF  PAIRS                          33
                I  17 I Prove that there is no constant c such that
                                   C(x, y) ^ C(x) + log C(x) + C(y) + c
            for all X and y.
                (Hint:  Replace C in the right-hand side by I and count the number of corre­
            sponding pairs.)
                 18 (a) Prove that
            for any prefix-free encoding i h î  (here S is the set of all binary strings).
                (b)  Prove that if a prefix-free encoding increases the length of an n-bit string 
            at most by f(n), i.e., if l(x) < l(x) + f(l(x)), then E n 2“^"' < oo.
                This problem explains why a coefficient 2 appears in Theorem 16 (p. 31):  the
            series
                           V   1     V       1        V           1
                           ^  n2 ’   ^  n(logn)2 ’    ^  n log n(log log n)
            converge, while the series
                              V 1      V  1          V          1
                                 ' n ’     n log n ’    '  n log n log log n ’
            diverge.
                The following problem describes functions that can be used for bounds similar 
            to Theorem 16.
                 19  Let /: N —>■ N be a non-decreasing total computable function.  Prove that 
            the following three properties are equivalent:
                (a)  C(x, y) < C(x) + C(y) + f(C(x)) + 0(1);
                (b)  C(x,y) < l(x) + l(y) + f(l(x)) + 0(1);
                (c)  E n 2"/(n)  < °°-
                (Hint: .(a)  obviously implies  (b);  to get  the reverse implication,  consider the 
            shortest  descriptions.  To  derive  (a)  from  (c),  one  can  count  pairs  with  l(x) + 
            f(l(x)) + l(y) < щ one can also use results about prefix complexity (see Chapter 4, 
            Problem 107).  Finally, to derive (c) from (b), note that the right-hand side in (b) 
            is at most n + 0(1) if l(x) = к and l(y) = n — к — f(k), for к + f(k) ^ n.  So the 
            number of such pairs is at least  '^/2к2п~к~^к">  = 2n^2k2~^k^  where the sum is 
            taken over all к such that к + f(k) ^ n.)
                 20  Prove that all the inequalities of Theorem 16 become false if the coefficient 
            2 is replaced by 1 but remain true with the coefficient 1 + e for any e > 0.
                (Hint:  See the preceding problem.)
                 21  Prove that
                           C(x, y) < C(x) + log C(x) + C(y) + log C(y) + 0(1).
                 22 (Continued) Prove a stronger inequality:
                            C(x,y) ^ C(x) + C(y) + log(C(z) + C(y)) + 0(1).
            (Note that C(x) + C(y) can be replaced by max(0(x), C(y)).  This gives a factor 
            at most 2, which makes 0(1) after taking logarithms.)
