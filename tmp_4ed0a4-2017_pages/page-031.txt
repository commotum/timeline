                   Plain Kolmogorov complexity
                      1.1.  Definition and main properties
           Let us recall the definition of Kolmogorov complexity from the introduction. 
        This version of complexity was defined by Kolmogorov in his seminal paper  [78]. 
        In order to distinguish it from later versions we call it the plain Kolmogorov com­
        plexity.  Later,  starting  from  Chapter  4,  we  will  also  consider  other  versions  of 
        Kolmogorov complexity, including prefix versions and monotone versions, but for 
        now by Kolmogorov complexity we always mean the plain version.
           Recall that  a  description  mode,  or  a  decompressor,  is  a partial  computable 
        function  D  from the set  of all  binary strings  H  into  E.  A partial  function  D  is 
        computable  if there  is  an  algorithm  that  terminates  and  returns  D(x)  on  every 
        input  X  in the domain of D and does not terminate on all other inputs.  We say 
        that y is a description of x with respect to D if D{y) = x.
           The complexity of a string x with respect to description mode D is defined as
                         CD(x) = min{l(y) I D(y) = x}.
        The minimum of the empty set is +oo.
           We say that a description mode D\  is not worse than a description mode D2 
        if there is a constant c such that Cdx (x)  ^ Cd2 (x) + c for all x and write this as 
        CDl(x) ^ Cd2(x) + 0(1).
           A description mode is called optimal if it is not worse than any other description 
        mode.  By the  Solomonoff-Kolmogorov  universality  theorem  (Theorem  1,  p.  3) 
        optimal  description  modes  exist.  Let  us  briefly  recall  its  proof.  Let  U  be  an 
        interpreter of a universal programming language, that is,  U(p, x) is the output of 
        the program p on input x.  We assume that programs and inputs are binary strings. 
        Let
                             D(px) — U(p, x).
        Here p  и  p stands  for  any  computable mapping having the following property: 
        given p we can effectively find p and also the place where p ends (in particular, if p 
        is a prefix of q, then p = q).  This property implies that D is well defined.  For any 
        description mode D' let p be a program of D'.  Then
                           Cd(x) ^ Cd'(x) + l{p)-
        Indeed, for every description y of x with respect to D' the string py is a description 
        of x with respect to D.
           Fix  any  optimal description  mode  D,  and  let  C(x)  (we  drop  the  subscript) 
        denote the complexity of x with respect to D.  (As we mentioned, in the first paper 
        of Kolmogorov [78] the letter К was used, while in his second paper [79] the letter 
        H was used.  We follow here the notation used by Li and Vitånyi [103].)
