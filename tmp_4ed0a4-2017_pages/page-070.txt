                                            3.2.  THE  STRONG  LAW  OF  LARGE  NUMBERS                                      55
                      Here are some simple but useful observations:
                          •  The definition does not change if we restrict ourselves to rational values 
                             of £ (or even let e = 2~k for integer k).
                          •  Any subset of a null set is a null set.
                          •  A finite or countable union of null sets is a null set.  (Indeed, to cover the 
                             union by a family of intervals of total measure less than e,  we combine 
                             the covers of its parts that have measure less than er/2, ^/4, er/8, etc.).
                          •  Assume that p is chosen in such a way that any singleton is a null set 
                             (it  is equivalent to the following property:  for any infinite sequence и =
                                       • ■ •  the  limit  of р(и>о ■ ■ -cjn)  (as  n      oo)  equals  0).  Then every 
                             finite or countable set is a null set.
                      A uniform measure on О assigns to each interval                        the number              :
                                             p(x) = 2~n for all strings x of length n.
                The uniform measure is closely related to the standard measure on E  (or,  more 
                precisely, on [0,1]).  Formally, the measure of a set А C fl is equal to the measure 
                of the set  of reals whose binary expansions are elements of A.  (In fact,  the cor­
                respondence between infinite binary fractions and reals in  [0,1]  is not a bijection, 
                since numbers of the form k/2l  for integer к and I have two representations, e.g., 
                0.01111 • • •  =  0.10000 • • •.  But  this  happens  only  for a countable  family of reals, 
                and measure theory easily ignores this.)
                      Indeed, the reals, whose binary expansions start with x, form an interval, and 
                the length of this interval is 2~n where n is the length of x.  This implies that for 
                every interval I C  [0,1]  the uniform measure of the sequences that represent reals 
                in I is equal to the length of the interval I.
                      Probability theory describes the uniform distribution as the probability distri­
                bution for the outcomes of independent fair coin tossing.  Indeed, for n independent 
                fair coin tossings, all 2n binary strings of length n appear with the same probability 
                2~n.  The set Qx is the event  “a random sequence of zeros and ones starts with ж”, 
                and this event has probability
                      Similarly, we may consider a biased coin assuming that coin tossings are still in­
                dependent.  The corresponding measure (probability distribution) is called Bernoulli 
                measure  (or Bernoulli distribution) with parameters q,p (probabilities of 0 and  1 
                respectively; we assume that p,q ^ 0, and p + q = 1).
                     With respect to this distribution,  the event  “sequence cj  starts with a string 
                x”  has probability qupv where и and v are the numbers of zeros and ones in x.  In 
                other words, we consider a function
                                                             x*->qu{x)pv{x\
                where u{x) and v{x) stand for the numbers of zeros and ones in x, respectively.  (It 
                is easy to check that this function has the additivity property.)
                                         3.2.  The Strong Law of Large Numbers
                     To see all these notions in action, let us state and prove the so-called Strong 
                Law of Large Numbers (SLLN).
                     Fix some p, q ^ 0 such that p + q — 1.  Let Ap be the set of all infinite sequences
                          • • •  of zeros and ones such that the limit frequency of ones exists and is equal
