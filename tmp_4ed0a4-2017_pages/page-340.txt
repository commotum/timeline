        328      10.  INEQUALITIES  FOR ENTROPY, COMPLEXITY AND SIZE
          The linear inequalities (of the type considered) are universal formulae of some 
        language, so a natural question arises:  Is a similar result true for more complicated 
        statements,  say,  for  V3-formulas  of the  same  language  (defined  in  some  natural 
        way)?  The answer turns out to be negative, as shown in [141].
                 10.7.  Combinatorial interpretation:  Examples
          Let us recall the main idea of the combinatorial interpretation:  The statement 
        “x has complexity at most n”  is translated as  “x belongs to the set of at most 2n 
        elements”.1  (Since the complexity is defined up to 0(1), we do not specify whether 
        we consider strict or non-strict  inequalities.)  In this way we get a combinatorial 
        translation of a binary relation C(x) < n, so all statements should be reformulated 
        in terms of this binary relation.  Here are some examples:
            •  The inequality C(x) ^ C(y) means that for every n the statement C(y) < 
              n implies C(x) < n.
            •  The inequality C(x) ^ 2C(y) can be rephrased as follows:  for every n the 
              inequality C(y) < n implies C(x) < 2n.
            •  For the inequality C(z)  ^ C(x) + C(y), the following translation can be 
              used:  for every и and v, if C(x) < и and C(y) < v, then C{z) < u + v.
        Using the last example as a guideline, let us try to invent a combinatorial translation 
        of the inequality C(x,y) ^ C(x) + C(y).  As we have said, it means that C(x) <_u 
        and C(y) < v imply C(x, y) < u + v.  So we want to say something like “if x belongs 
        to some set of size at most 2U, and у belongs to some set of size at most 2V, then 
        we can construct a set of size at most 2U+V that is guaranteed to contain  (x,y)”. 
        Indeed,  we can consider the  Cartesian product of two given sets,  and its size is 
        indeed bounded by 2U+V, so we get a true (though trivial) statement.
          To get a combinatorial version of the inequality C(x,y) ^ C(x) + C(y |x), we 
        need to translate the statement C(y |x)  < v.  This can be done as follows:  (x,y) 
        belongs to some set whose sections (for every fixed x) have size at most 2V.  In this 
        way we again get a true (but trivial) combinatorial statement.
          We get a much more interesting situation when we consider the reverse inequal­
        ity.  We can try to rewrite C(z) > C(x)+C(y) as follows:  If C(x) ^ и and C(y) > v, 
        then C(z) ^ и + v.  But our approach is asymmetric:  We know what it means in 
        combinatorial terms when C is small, not large (the reason for this asymmetry is 
        that we can enumerate strings of small complexity, but not of large complexity). 
        So we need to consider a dual reformulation:  If it is not true that C(x) < и and it 
        is not true that C(y) < v, then it is not true that C(z) < u + v.  In other words, if 
        C(z) < u + v, then C{x) < и or C{y) < v.
          Let us now try to invent a combinatorial translation of the inequality
                          C(x,y) ^ C(x) + C(y |x).
        Using the trick described, we get the following statement.  If a pair  (x, y)  belongs 
        to  a given set of size  at  most  2U+V,  then either x  belongs to some set of size at 
        most 2U or (x, y)  belongs to some set of pairs whose sections (for every fixed first 
        coordinate) are of size at most 2V.
             course this should not be understood literally:  every x belongs to a singleton.  We will 
        see how this is interpreted in the examples below.
