                      11.3.  THE  COMBINATORIAL  MEANING  OF  COMMON  INFORMATION        357
            information  z  is  simple  relative  to  x  and  y,  so  this  inequality  is  a  quantitative 
            statement that says that common information cannot be extracted.
                P r o o f.  We may assume without loss of generality that C(z)  =   0{n)  (if the 
            complexity of z is big, then C(z\x) and C(z\y) are greater than C(z)f2).
                Let  us  rewrite  the  inequality  in  terms  of the  quantities  that  appear  in  the 
            definition of C(x,y):  it may be rewritten as
                              C(z) < 2C(x, z) -  2C(x) + 2C(y, z) - 2C(y),
            and then
                     C(z) ^ 2C(z) + 2C(x I z) -  2C(x) + 2C(z) + 2C(y \ z) - 2C(y),
            i.e.,
                             2C{x) + 2C{y) ^ 3C(z) + 2C(x \ z) + 2C(y \ z).
            The left-hand side equals 8n; to check that the right-hand side cannot be less, we 
            consider each line on Figure 36 (and it is enough to consider points with a minimal 
            sum of coordinates).                                                          □
                 308  Prove that for small values of C(z) one can get a better bound 
                                       C(z) ^ C(z\x) + C(z\y), 
            but in general the constant 2 cannot be improved.
                    11.3.  The combinatorial meaning of common information
                Theorem 224 gives us an example of a pair of strings that do not have  (ex­
            tractable)  common information in the strongest possible sense.  Still it  does not 
            explain why this happens,  what properties of x  and y  make mutual information 
            non-extractable.  This is a rather informal question, and we do not know any state­
            ment that answers it completely.  Still some observations can be made.
                What does it mean that for given x  and y  there exists a string z such that 
            C{z) < o;,  C{x\z)  < ß,  and C{y\z) < 7?  Let us denote by Um(z)  the set of all 
            strings whose conditional complexity given z is less than m.  The size of this set is 
            about 2m.  Our condition means that the pair  (x,y)  is covered by one of the sets 
            Uß(z) x U*y(z)\ there are at most 0(2“) sets of this type (one for each z).
                Therefore, the condition  (o;,/?,7)  £ C(x,y)  means that the pair  (x,y)  is cov­
            ered by a union of 2“ combinatorial rectangles of size 2^ x 27.  (A combinatorial 
            rectangle is a product of two arbitrary sets.)  On the other hand, if (x, y)  is covered 
            by an enumerable family of 2“ combinatorial rectangles of size 2^  x 27,  then the 
            triple  (o;, ß, 7)  (plus the complexity of the enumeration algorithm and logarithmic 
            overhead)  belongs to C(x,y)\  Let z be the ordinal number of the rectangle that 
            covers  (x,y).  So one can say that the set C{x,y) is determined if we know which 
            (simple enumerable) families of combinatorial rectangles cover the pair (x,y).
                Now it is clear how one can construct an example of a pair without common 
            information—find a set that is difficult to cover by combinatorial rectangles,  and 
            take a random element of this set.  (This approach also was suggested by An. Much- 
            nik).
                It is convenient to identify the sets of pairs with binary relations, or bipartite 
            graphs—a pair (x, y)  is then an edge that connects vertex x  in the left part with 
            vertex y  in the right part.  The combinatorial rectangle is then the set of all edges 
            that connect some subset of the left part and some subset of the right part.
