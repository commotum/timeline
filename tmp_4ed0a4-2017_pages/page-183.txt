               and we fill a similar table with rational numbers ац in such a way that aij/m(i, j) -f> 
               0.  How do we fill this table?  For each row we compute the sum of current val­
               ues m(i, •);  if it crosses one of the thresholds  1/2,1/4,1/8 • • •, we put the crossed 
              threshold value into the а-table (filling it with zeros from left to right while waiting 
              for the next threshold crossed).  In this way we guarantee that aij is a computable 
              function of i  and j\  the sum of a-values in every row differs from the sum of re­
              values in the same row at most by factor 2  (in both directions);  this implies that 
              the new series is convergent and that in every row there exists some а-value that is 
              at least half of the corresponding m-value.  Logarithms of а-values form a Solovay 
              function (and atj itself form a slowly convergent series).
                   Note that this construction does not give a non-decreasing Solovay function di­
              rectly (it seems that we still need to use the arguments from the preceding section).
                   5.7.7.  Busy beavers and convergence moduli.  We had several definitions 
              that  formalize  the  intuitive  idea  of a  “slowly  converging  series”.  However,  the 
              following one (probably the most straightforward) was not considered yet.  If an —> 
              a, for every e > 0 there exists some N such that  |a - a n|  < e for all n > N.  The 
              minimal N with this property (considered as a function of e, denoted by e h-> N(e)) 
              is called a modulus of convergence.  A sequence (or a series) should be considered 
               “slowly converging” if this function grows fast (as e —> 0).  Let us show how the the 
              Solovay property could be equivalently characterized in these terms.
                   In Section 1.2  (p. 21) we defined B(n) as a maximal integer whose complexity 
              does not exceed n.  We used plain complexity there (since at that time no other 
              versions were defined), but a similar definition can be given for prefix complexity. 
              Let BP(n) be the maximal integer whose prefix complexity does not exceed n.
                    165         Fix an optimal prefix-free universal machine M.  Let T(m) be the maxi­
              mal time needed for termination of all terminating computations on inputs of length 
              at most m.  Then
                                           BP(m — c) ^ T(m) < BP(m, + c)
              for some c and all m.
                   (Hint:  One  can  use  the  same  argument  as  for  plain  complexity  (see  Sec­
              tion 1.2).)
                   Now we can prove the equivalence of different notions of “slow convergence” :
                   Theorem  114.  The computable series of non-negative rational numbers Yhri 
              has the Solovay property (^  has a random sum)  if and only if its modulus of con­
              vergence grows fast:  N(2“m) > BP(m — c) for some c and for all m.
                   Proof.  Let a = J2ri —                 where      = ro + • • • +     i.  Assume that a is
              random.  We have to show that \a — a;| < 2“m implies K(i) > m — 0(1); this shows 
              that N(2~m) ^ BP(m — 0(1)).  Since K(i) = K(ai) + 0(1), it is enough to show 
              that every rational 2“'^approximation to a has complexity at least m — 0(1).  This 
              is a bit stronger condition than the condition K(ao ■ ■ ■ cc,n_i) > m — 0(1) (used in 
              the prefix complexity version of the Levin-Schnorr theorem) since now we consider
