                                                                    10.2.   UNIFORM SETS                                                      319
                         We assume (as usual)  that m(0 )  =  1  and m(0 1J)  =  1  for every J.  On the 
                   other hand, we define m(I\ 0 ) as m(I).  For example, consider a set A C X\  x X2 
                   (see Figure 31).
                                                             2

                         Then 7Пл({1}) is the cardinality of the projection of A onto a horizontal axis, 
                   mA({2}) is the size of the vertical projection, mA({2} | {1}) is the maximal size of 
                   the vertical section, and mA({ 1} | {2}) is the maximal size of the horizontal section. 
                   The total number of elements in the set is mA({l,2}).
                         We can write the (obvious) inequality
                                                                m(l, 2) ^ m{ 1) ■ m{2 | 1)
                   (we omit the subscript  A  and curly brackets for brevity).  Indeed,  each of m{ 1) 
                   vertical sections contains at most m(2| 1) elements.
                         For an n-dimensional set a similar inequality says that
                              m(l, 2,... ,n) ^ m{ 1) • m(2 11) • m(311, 2) • ... ■ m(n| 1,2,..., n — 1).
                   It  is  true  for  the  same  reasons:  for  each  of m(l)  possible values  of the  first  co­
                   ordinate, there are at most m(2|l) values of the second coordinate;  for each pair 
                   there are at most m(3|l,2) values of the third coordinate;  and so on.  The same 
                   inequality is true for every permutation (k\,..., kn) of (1,2,..., n):
                         m(ki,. ..,kn)^ m(ki) ■ m(k2 \ki) ■ m(k3 \ki,k2) • ... ■ m(kn\ki,... ,fcn_i),
                   the left-hand side remains the same (the cardinality of A).
                         Now we are ready to give the definition of a uniform set.  A set A is uniform 
                   if all these inequalities (for all n! permutations of the set of indices) are equalities. 
                   The simplest example of a uniform set is a (combinatorial) parallelepiped, i.e., the 
                   set A\  x • • • x An for some Ai c Xi.
                         However,  there are other examples of uniform sets.  For example,  Figure 32 
                   shows a uniform sets of six elements (all non-zero sections have two elements and 
                   both projections have three).
                         Let J, J, К be disjoint sets of indices.  Then for arbitrary A the following in­
                   equality holds:
                                                      m(J U K\I) ^ m(J\I) ■ m(K\I U J)
