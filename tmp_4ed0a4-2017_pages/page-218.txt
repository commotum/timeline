                                       6.4.  COMPLEXITIES  AND  ORACLES                        205
             that differs from y.  The emphasized property can be checked using a O'-oracle since 
             it  has  an enumerable negation.  And our assumption guarantees that y equals x. 
             Therefore,
                                      C° (ж) <  lim  C(x К  ^ n) + 0(1).

                 On the other hand,  let  у be  a description  of x  with respect  to  a O'-optimal 
             decompressor,  and  let  к  be  the  length of y.  Consider  a following program  that 
             has additional input N:  make N steps of the enumeration of the universal set O' 
             and then  use  the  set  of enumerated  elements  as  an oracle  for  decompression  of 
             y.  This program can be constructed effectively given у,  therefore its complexity 
             does not exceed C{y) + 0(1) ^ l(y) + 0(1) — к + 0(1).  On the other hand, if N is 
             large enough, this program generates x (since only a finite number of oracle calls are 
             performed during the decompression of y, for all sufficiently large N these questions 
             get correct answers even if the oracle is replaced by its iV-approximation).       □
                 It  turns  out  that  a  similar  result  is  true  where  we  replace  C(x\\  ^  n)  by 
            supm^n C(x\m).  Note that
                                         sup C(x\m) < C(x II  ^ n),
                                         m^n
            since  the optimal  program  in the right-hand side  can be  used  for  any m in  the 
             left-hand side.  This is easy; the surprising result is that both sides have the same 
            limit as n —> oo (up to an O(l)-term):
                 Theorem 132.
                                      limsupС(жIn) — О0 (ж) + 0(1).
                                       n—>oo
                 Proof.  We have to prove that if (for some string x and integer к)
                                   C(x I n) < к for any sufficiently large n,
            then O'-complexity of x does not exceed k + 0( 1).  The difficulty here is that (unlike 
            in the previous theorem) the program of length less than к that maps n to x may 
            depend on n, and none of these programs is guaranteed to work for all sufficiently 
            large n.
                 Note that  there is  less  than  2k  strings  x  with  this  property  (for  a given  k). 
            Indeed, if we have more of them, then for sufficiently large n we run out of programs 
            of length less than k.
                 It would be enough to prove that the set of strings x that have this property is 
            a O'-enumerable set whose enumeration effectively depends on к (in other words, it 
            would be enough to prove that the function x i-> lim sup C(x \ n) is O'-enumerable 
            from above).  However, the natural description of this set,
                                         3N (Vn ^ N) [C(x\n) < k],
            shows only that  it  is  a  Ез-set  (the condition  in  brackets  is  enumerable  and two 
            quantifiers precede it), so we choose an another approach.
                 Note that we do not really need this set to be O'-enumerable.  It is enough to 
            show that it is a subset of a O'-enumerable set that contains less than 2k  elements 
            for a given k.  This can be done as follows.
                 Consider two-dimensional enumerable set of pairs (n, x) such that C(x | n) < k. 
            This set  (for each k)  is  thin in the following sense:  all vertical sections of this set 
             (for fixed n) contain fewer than 2k elements.
