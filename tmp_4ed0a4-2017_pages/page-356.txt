              344             10.  INEQUALITIES  FOR ENTROPY,  COMPLEXITY AND SIZE
                                                                  ß

                  Theorem 218.  For every quintuple of random variables a,ß,j,S,£ the follow­
              ing inequality holds:
                I(or.ß) < I(a:/?|7) + I(a:ß\S) + IfriS) + I(a:ß\e) + I(cr.e\ß) + I(ß:e\a).
                  This inequality looks frightening; nevertheless, some comments could be useful 
              (at least, for memorizing this inequality).  The right-hand side consists of two parts. 
              The first three terms, without e,  are exactly the same as in Ingleton’s inequality. 
              If there were no other terms in the right-hand side, we would get exactly Ingleton’s 
              inequality,  which is  false,  so  we  add other terms  to  make the  inequality weaker. 
              Namely, we add
                                  W(a,ß,e) = I(a:ß\e) + I(a:e\ß)+I(ß:e\a).
                  This additional term (see Figure 34) contains £ while the rest of the inequality 
              does  not.  One can say that  Ingleton’s  inequality  may  be  false,  but  the  error is 
              bounded by infe W{a,ß,e)\ this (mysterious) quantity depends only on a and ß.
                  One more observation:  we can use the same variable  (let us call it £)  as a, 
              ß,  and £  (here we really mean the same variable,  not the identically distributed 
              variable).  Then W(a,ß,e) — 0, and we get the inequality
              (*)                       Щ()^НШ+НШ6) + 1(т.6)
              that we have seen while proving Ingleton’s inequality for the dimensions of vector 
              spaces.
                  We can also derive the following conditional inequality from Theorem 218.  If 
              W(a,ß,e) = 0 for some e, then
                                     I (a :ß)^I{a:ß\4) + I{a:ß\6) + J(7 : S)
              for all 7 and 5.  Using this conditional inequality, we see that the special ray from 
              Section  10.11  does  not  belong to  E  (let  a =  £3,  ß  =  £4,  7  =  £ —      S  =  £2). 
              However, this ray satisfies all basic inequalities, so the inequality of Theorem 218 
              cannot be derived from basic inequalities.
                  This conditional inequality can be proven directly by applying the inequality 
              (*) to the random variable £ provided by the next theorem (applied to a, ß, and e).
                  Theorem  219.  IfW(a,ß, 7 )  =  0,  the  random  variables  a,/3,7  have  “fully 
              extractable  common information”  in  the following  sense.  There  exists  a  random 
              variable £  such that
                                         H((\a) = H((\ß) = H(t\'1)=0,
                                                                             =   0.
