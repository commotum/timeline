           (that defines the common distribution) in such a way that a matrix of the form
           appears (here the two zeros stand for zero blocks).  In this case the strings obtained 
           by n trials of a and ß have no extractable common information.  On the other hand, 
           if such a permutation (that produces a matrix of this form) exists, some part of the 
           mutual information is extractable (indeed, both variables determine the number of 
           the block they are in).  This argument (see [112] for the details) gives an alternative 
           proof of a criterion first obtained by Gåcs and Körner [59].
