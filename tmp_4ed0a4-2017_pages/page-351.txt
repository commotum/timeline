                                                                               ft                   ft                                               f t    [ f t ]
                                                                         Figure 33.  Complexity pictures for triples
                            strings that  correspond  to  this  picture,  we  come  to  the  following problem.  The 
                            right picture hints that £3  and £4  have n bits of common information that is also 
                            included in £1  and £2-  On the other hand,  the left picture shows that £1  and £2 
                            do  not  have  common  information  (they have  zero  in  the  intersection  part).  Of 
                            course, it is not a formal contradiction, since we have not specified what we mean 
                            by  “common information”.  But  indeed we will show later that £ь£2)£з,  and £4 
                            with these complexities do not exist.
                                     If some extremal rays to not  intersect £,  it  may happen that some other in­
                            equalities  (in addition to the basic ones)  are true for complexities.  How can one 
                            find them?  Maybe we know all the extreme rays of our cone, and it remains to find 
                            the faces of this cone to get the new inequalities?  One can indeed find the faces of 
                            the cone generated by all non-special rays.  In addition to basic inequalities we get 
                            one more (up to renaming of the variables):
                                                                   Щз : ft К  /(ft : ft I ft ) + /(ft : ft I ft ) +  A ft : ft ).
                           We have rewritten this inequality in terms of conditional entropies to make it more 
                            understandable.  In terms of unconditional complexities we get the inequality
                                                                   12 + 3 + 4 + 134 + 234 < 13 + 23 + 14 + 24 + 34
                            (we write only the indices to make it short; for example, 134 stands for FT(£i, £3, £4)), 
                           which looks even more mysterious).
                                     It  turns out  that this inequality is well known in matroid theory;  it is called 
                            Ingleton’s inequality for the dimensions of subspaces of vector spaces:
                                     Theorem 215.  Let H\, H2, H3, H4 be finite-dimensional subspaces of some 
                            vector space.  Then
                            dim(#i+#2) + dim#3 + dim #4 + dmfiHi+Hs + Hi) + dim(#2+#3 + # 4)
                                    < dim (#4 + # 3)+dim(#2 + #3 ) + dim(#4 + #4 )+dim(#2 + #4 )+dim(#3 + Hfi).
                                     Before  proving  this  theorem,  let  us  elaborate  upon  the  connection  between 
                           entropies and dimensions.  Let F be a finite field, and let X be a finite-dimensional 
                           space over F.  For each subspace  Y  С  I ,   we consider  a random variable.  The 
                           probability space is the space of all linear functionals X —> F; the random variable 
                           £y  (corresponding to  the  subspace  Y)  maps  every functional  in  the  probability 
                           space to  its restriction on Y.  (Less formally,  for each subspace Y we consider a 
                           random variable that is a restriction of a random functional on Y.)  The values of 
                           £y are elements of the space Y* (dual to У), and they all have the same probability, 
                           so the entropy of £y equals dim У • log |F|.
