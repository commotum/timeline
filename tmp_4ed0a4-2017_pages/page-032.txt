              16                        1.  PLAIN  KOLMOGOROV COMPLEXITY
                  As the optimal description mode is not worse than the identity function x >-»• x, 
              we obtain the inequality C{x) ^ l(x) + 0(1)  (Theorem 2, p. 5).
                  Let A be a partial computable function.  Comparing the optimal description 
              mode D with the description mode y (-»• A(D(y)), we conclude that
                                              0(А(ж))^0(ж) + 0(1),
              showing the non-growth of complexity under algorithmic transformations  (Theo­
              rem 3, p. 5).
                  Using this inequality, we can define Kolmogorov complexity of other finite ob­
              jects,  such  as  natural  numbers,  graphs,  permutations,  finite sets  of strings,  etc., 
              that can be naturally encoded by binary strings.
                  For example, let us define the complexity of natural numbers.  A natural num­
              ber n can be written in binary notation.  Another way to represent a number by a 
              string is as follows.  Enumerate all the binary strings in lexicographical order
                                  A, 0,1,00,01,10,11,000,001,010, Oil, 100,...
              using the natural numbers 0,1, 2,3,... as indexes.  This enumeration is more con­
              venient compared to binary representation as it is a bijection.  Every string can be 
              considered as an encoding of its index in this enumeration.  Finally,  one can also 
              encode a natural number n by a string consisting of n ones.
                  Using either of these three encodings,  we can define the  complexity of n  as 
              the complexity of the string encoding n.  Three resulting complexities of n differ 
              at  most  by an  additive constant.  Indeed,  for every pair of these encodings there 
              is  an  algorithm translating the first encoding into the second one.  Applying this 
              algorithm, we increase the complexity at most by a constant.  Note that the Kol­
              mogorov complexity of binary strings is defined up to an additive constant, so the 
              choice of a computable encoding does not matter.
                  As the length of the binary representation of a natural number n is equal to 
              logn + 0(1), the Kolmogorov complexity of n is at most logn + 0(1).  (By log we 
              denote binary logarithms.)
                  Here is another application of the non-growth of complexity under algorithmic 
              transformations.  Let  us  show  that  deleting  the  last  bit  of a  string  changes  its 
              complexity at most by a constant.  Indeed,  all three functions x i-». xO,  i  4  il, 
              x ^  (x without the last bit) are computable.
                  The same is true for the first bit.  However this does not apply to every bit of 
              the string.  To show this, consider the string x consisting of 2n zeros; its complexity 
              is at most C(n) + 0(1) ^ logn + 0(1).  (By log we always mean binary logarithm.) 
              There are 2n different strings obtained from x by flipping one bit.  At least one of 
              them has complexity n or more.  (Recall that the number of strings of complexity 
              less than n does not exceed the number of descriptions of length less than n, which 
              is less than 2n; see Theorem 5, p. 8.)
                  Incrementing a natural number n by  1 changes C(n)  at most by a constant. 
              This implies that C(n) satisfies the Lipschitz property,  for some c and for all m, n, 
             we have \C(m) — C{ri)\ ^ c|m — n|.
                  [T] Prove a stronger inequality:  \C(m) — C(n)\ ^ \m — n| + c for some c and for 
              all m, n € N, and, moreover, \C(m) — C(n)\ ^ 2 log \ m — n\ + c (the latter inequality 
              assumes that m Ф n).
