                          11.2.  REPRESENTING  MUTUAL  INFORMATION  AS  A  STRING          355
                Theorem 224.  For every n there exist strings x, y of complexity 2n +  O(logn) 
            such that C(x,y) = 3n + 0(logn),  and for every z at least one of the following three 
            inequalities is true:
                (a)  C(z) + C(x\z) ^ 3n — O(logn);
                (b)  C(z) + C(y\z) ^ 3n — O(logn);
                (c)  (7(2) + (7(:r | z) + C{y\z) ^ 4  n — O(logn).
                To be completely formal, we state the following:  For some c and for all n there 
            exist  strings  x  and  y  whose complexities deviate from 2n by at most clogn,  the 
            complexity of the pair deviates from 3n by at most clogn, and for every string 2 
            one of the inequalities (a)-(c) is true with clogn in the right-hand side in place of 
            O(logn).
                The pair constructed in this theorem is the worst-case pair from the viewpoint 
            of common information.  This vague statement can be made precise in the following 
            way.  For each pair x,y let us consider the set C(x,y) C N3 of triples (a,/3, 7) such 
            that there exists a string 2 that makes three conditions
                               C(z) < a,  C(x\z) < ß,     and  C(y\z)<'y
            true.  The  set  C(x,y)  is  upwards  closed  (obviously).  Note  that  C(x,y)  is  not 
            determined by complexities of x, y, and the pair x, y:  We have seen two pairs that 
            that both have C{x) = C(y)  =  2n and C(x,y)  =  3n but have different  C(x,y). 
            As we will see,  these examples are extreme points:  we get a maximal set C(x,y) 
            if x and y are (respectively) 2n-bit prefix and 2n-bit suffix of some random 3n-bit 
            string, and we get a minimal C(x,y) for the pair provided by Theorem 224.
                Let us explain why this happens.  Assume that x and y are strings of complexity 
            2n with mutual information n (as usual, we allow the deviation of order O(logn) 
            without saying this explicitly).  Every triple  (a,/5,7)  G  C(x,y) should satisfy the 
            obvious inequalities
                               a + ß ^ 2n,   a + 7 ^ 2n,    a + ß + 7 ^ 3n
            (since C(x)  <  C(z) + C(x\z)  and so on).  This means that C(x,y) is a subset of 
            the set Cm of all triples (a, /5,7) satisfying these three inequalities.  (Again we omit 
            O(logn) terms that are needed for the exact statement.)
                How can we represent this set of triples in an intuitive way?  For each ß and 
            7 there is some threshold ao(ß,j)—the triples with a >      belong to Cm and the 
            triples  with  a < ao  do  not  belong to  Cm-  The graph of the function  (/3,7) 
            ao(/3,7)  is  the  boundary  of Cm-  It  has  three  faces  (corresponding to  the three 
            inequalities),  and can be represented on the plane by drawing for every a the set 
            of points where ao(/3,7) = a (i.e., the level line of the function ao).  This line is а 
            boundary of the horizontal (fixed a) section of Cm-  See Figure 35.
                Using this picture,  it  is easy to check that for our first example  (overlapping 
            factors  of a random string)  the set  C(x,y)  achieves  its  upper bound  Cm-  How 
            should we choose 2 for given a,/3,7 in (7m?  When a < n, we let 2 be a part of 
            the overlap;  adding 2 as the condition then decreases the complexities of both x 
            and у by a.  If a > n, we let 2 be the overlap plus some parts of x and у (in some 
            proportion; the change in the proportion gives different points on a line with slope 
            — 1 on the picture.
