                              10.11.  DIMENSIONS  AND  INGLETON’S  INEQUALITY               341
                 Recall  that  in  the  inequalities  for  entropies  the  conditional  entropy  H(a \ß) 
             appeared as a shortcut for H(a,ß) — H(ß).  This expression translates into dimen­
            sions  as  dim(A + B) — dim#.  In other words,  it  is the dimension  of the image 
            of the subspace A under linear mapping with kernel B, and this dimension equals 
            dim A — dim(A П В).  Similarly,  I(a:ß)  means  H(a) + H(ß) — H(a,ß),  and  it 
            corresponds  to  dim A + dim# — dim(A + В)  and  is  equal  to  dim(A П В).  Fi­
            nally,  I{ot:ß\'))  is equal to H(a I7) + H(ß I7) — H(a,ß I7), and it corresponds to 
            dim A/C+dimB/C—dim(A + B)/C, where X/C is the image of X under the linear 
            mapping that has kernel C.  Note that the latter expression cannot  be rewritten 
            as dim(A П B)/C—the image of Ап В under the mapping with kernel C can be 
            smaller than the intersection of images of A and В under the same mapping.  (This 
            happens, for example, if А, В, C are three different one-dimensional subspaces of a 
            two-dimensional space.)
                Ingleton’s inequality for the dimension of subspaces can now be rewritten as
                          dim(A П В) ^ I (A : В \ С) + I (A : B \ D) + dim(C П D),
            where I(A:B\C) stands for the dimension of the intersection of the images of A 
            and В under the mapping with kernel C.  Denote А П В by X\ it is enough to show 
            that
                               dimX ^ dimX/C + dimX/D + dim(C П D),
            since dim X/C ^ I (A : В \ C) (the image of the intersection is contained in the inter­
            section of the images, and can be even smaller).  The latter inequality corresponds 
            to an easy inequality for entropies
            and it remains to use Theorem 216.                                               □
                 296 Prove the inequality #(£) ^ #(£|7) -t- H(£\ö) + /(7 :5) that we used.
                (Hint:  Using the picture (or a simple computation), we note that 
                        л  (Î) + Я «  I ■7 , Ö) + Ih : 51Î) = H(i I ■7 ) + H(i IS) + J(7 : «), 
            so this inequality is the sum of basic inequalities.)
                 297 A careful reader would note that our proof of Ingleton’s inequality works
            only  for  vector  spaces  over  some  finite  field,  unless  we  use  some  rather  obscure 
            tricks for the case of an infinite field (see the discussion above).  How can we avoid 
            these tricks?
                (Hint:  The choice of the field was important for converting the inequality for 
            entropies into an inequality for dimensions.  But this inequality for entropies was a 
            combination of basic inequalities, and basic inequalities for dimensions are true for 
            arbitrary field.)
                 298  We know that the inequalities for entropies can be translated into in­
            equalities for  the sizes  of subgroups.  Show that  Ingleton’s  inequality  under this 
            translation becomes true for subgroups of an abelian group.
                (Hint:  Follow the proof of Ingleton’s inequality  using the sum of subgroups 
            instead of the intersection of subspaces  (in the abelian case the sum of subgroups 
            is a subgroup itself).)
                As a byproduct of our arguments we obtain the following interesting observa­
