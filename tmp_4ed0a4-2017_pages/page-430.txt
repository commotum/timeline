                    13.6.  COMPLEXITY NOT REDUCIBLE TO COMPLEXITIES OF TUPLES      421
               Lemma.  For all sufficiently large n there is a function Q of complexity at most 
           logn + 0(1)  such that for at least half of triples (a, b, c)  of words of length n the 
           complexity of the problem (a -А с) Л (b —> Q(a, b, c))  is at least 2n — O(logn).
               Before proving the lemma, let us explain how it implies Theorem 247.  Let Q 
           be a function satisfying the lemma.  The number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the 
           inequality C((a -А с) Л (b —> Q(a,b,c)))  ^ 2n — O(logn)  is at least 23n“1.  Hence 
           there  is  such  a triple  with  complexity  at  least  3n — 1.  Let  (ä,b,c)  be  any such 
           triple,  and let d = Q(a,b,c).  Then the complexity of the quadruple (a,b,c, d) and 
           the complexity of the triple (â, b, c) are close to 3n, as claimed before.  This implies 
           that  all the pairs of strings a, b, c,  and the strings à, b, c themselves have claimed 
           complexities.
               Moreover,  the  triple  (b, c, d)  is  also  random.  Indeed,  the  complexity  of the 
           problem  (a  —>  с) Л (b  —»  d)  is  at  least  2n  and  at  the  same  time  it  is  bounded 
           from above by the sum C(c) + C(d\b, c)  < 2n.  Therefore both terms in the sum 
           should be close to n.  Thus the word d is independent from the pair  (b, c).  Since 
           the pair (b, c)  is random, the triple  (b, c, d)  is also random.  The only requirements 
           that are not guaranteed by the lemma are the randomness of the triple (a, b, d) and 
           the randomness of the triple (ä,c,d).  We will explain later how we will guarantee 
           them.
               Proof.  To prove the lemma,  we define a decidable property of functions Q 
           that guarantees the statement of the lemma.  Then we will show that for all large 
           enough n a randomly chosen function has that property with positive probability 
           (hence the property is not empty).  By an exhaustive search,  for any given n we 
           are  able  to  find  a  function  Q  with  that  property.  Hence  the  graph  of the  first 
           found such function Q can be computed from n and thus its complexity is less than 
           logn + 0(1).
               Let S denote the set of all words of length n.  Let M be a set of (total) functions 
           from S to S.  We say that the set M serves a quadruple (a, b, c, d) € S'4, if /(a) — c 
           and g(b)  — d for some pair  (/, g)  € M.  The property of a function  Q we spoke 
           about above is the following:
                   every  set  M  consisting  of  less  than  2k  pairs  of  functions 
                   (from S to S) serves less than 1/8 of the quadruples of the form 
                   (a,b,c,Q(a,b, c)).
           We will specify the parameter к later; it will be a little less than 2n.  The property 
           guarantees that for at least 7/8 of the triples (a, b, c) the complexity of the problem 
           (a —> с) Л (b —> Q(a,b,c)) is larger than k.  Indeed, every solution to the problem 
           (a  —>  с) Л (b  —>  d)  is  a  pair  of programs  (p, q)  with  [p](a)  =  c  and  [ç](b)  =  d. 
           For every pair  (p, q)  of programs of complexity less than к, we can extend in an 
           arbitrary way the mappings a ^  [p](a) and b ha [g](6) onto the entire set S.  We get 
           a set M of pairs of functions of cardinality less than 2k.  Hence M serves less than 
           23n-3  quadruples  (a,b,c,Q(a,b,c)).  On the other hand M serves all quadruples 
           (a, b, c, d) such that the complexity of the problem (a —> c) A (b —> d) is less than k. 
           (The reader certainly noticed that to prove the lemma we need the property with 
           the threshold 1/2 in place of 1/8.  It will become clear later why we have chosen 
           1/8 as the threshold.)
