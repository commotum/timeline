                Theorem 224 provides an example of a pair (x, y) with smaller C(x, y).  Indeed, 
            it gives a pair where C(x, y) is contained in the union of the sets
                               a + ß ^ 3n,   a + 7 ^ 3n,   a + ß + 7 > 4n
            that correspond to inequalities (a)-(c).  Intersecting Cm with this union, we get a 
            smaller set that is called Cm in the sequel; it is shown in Figure 36.
                In  fact,  Cm  coincides with C(x,y)  for this pair,  and  Cm  C  C(x,y)  for every 
            pair x, y where x and y have complexity 2n and the pair has complexity 3n.
                To check this, we need to find a suitable z for every point (a,/3,7) G Cm•  It-is 
            enough to do this for all minimal triples in Cm  (since C(x,y)  is upwards closed). 
            The points on the lines with slope  —1  (Figure 36)  correspond to a string z that 
            combines  part  of x  with part  of y  in  some  proportion.  For  example,  the  point 
            (1.5n, 1.5n) corresponds to z that combines n/2 bits from the shortest description 
            of x and n/2 bits from the shortest description of y.  The point  (n, n) corresponds 
            to  a  string  z  of  length  2n  that  combines  n  bits  from  each  of the  two  shortest 
            descriptions.  The point  (n + h, h)  (where 0 ^ h ^ n) corresponds to a string z of 
            length 2n — h that is a prefix of the shortest description of y.  Then C(y\z) is the 
            number of the remaining bits,  i.e.,  h.  On the other hand,  C(x\z)  is bounded by 
            C(x\y)  (i.e., n) plus C(y\z)  (i.e.,  h).  Finally, the points (/1,0)  (where 0 < h < n) 
            correspond to strings z of complexity at most 3n — h that contain all y and n — h 
            bits of the shortest description of x given y.  So we get the following statement:
                Theorem  225.  For every pair (x,y) of strings  that have  complexity 2n  and 
            mutual information n, the set C(x,y) is  (with logarithmic precision)  between the 
            lower bound Cm and the upper bound Cm ; both bounds are achieved for some pairs.
                As soon as the set C(x,y)  is known for a pair  (x,y),  we can formally derive 
            some properties of this pair.  Here is one example:
                Theorem  226.  Assume  that C(x,y) — Cm (as it happens for the pair con­
            structed in  Theorem 224).  Then for every z the inequality
                                       C(z) ^ 2C(z\x) + 2C(z\y)
            holds.
                Before proving this inequality, let us comment on its meaning.  It says that only 
            strings z of small complexity can be simple relative to x and y at the same time. 
            Note that if one can extract common information from x and г/, then this common
