                                  CHAPTER 13
                           Information and logic
                       13.1.  Problems, operations, complexity
            In this  chapter we define a problem  as an  arbitrary  (finite or infinite)  set  of 
         binary strings.  The elements of this set are called solutions to that problem.
            Why such strange terminology?  Generally speaking, having a problem, we need 
         to solve it, i.e., to find its solution.  We assume that a solution can be represented 
         by text (written in some formal language), i.e., by a binary string (assuming some 
         natural  encoding  is  used).  We  will  measure  the  amount  of information  in  the 
         solutions ignoring all other aspects, so we identify the problem with the set of its 
         solutions.
            By complexity of a problem A we mean the minimal complexity of its solutions, 
                             C(X) =  min{C(i) I  X G  X}.
         As usual, the empty set, i.e., the unsolvable problem, has complexity +oo.
            For example, the complexity of a singleton  {x}  is just the complexity of the 
         string x.  For a less trivial example, recall that in Section 1.2, we considered  (for 
         a given n)  the problem  “find a natural number  к  ^  n”.  The complexity of this 
         problem was denoted by С^(п).  Now we can say that we consider the problem
            n”, whose solutions are natural numbers к ^ n, and its complexity.  (Formally, 
         we have to speak about binary representations of those numbers.)
            Let  X  and  У  be  two  problems.  We  can  consider  the  problem  “solve  both 
         problems X and У”, as well as the problem  “choose one of the problems X and 
         Y and solve it”.  The solutions for the first problem ( “X and У” ) are pairs (w, v) 
         where и is a solution to X and v is a solution to Y.  The solutions to the second 
         problem (“X or Y”) are solutions to one of the problems X, Y plus a special tag 
         that  says which of the two problems we are trying to solve.  So we come to the 
         following formal definitions:
                        XAY = {[x,y] \xeX,yeY},
                        X У Y = {[0, ж] I ж G A} U {[1,у] I у G Y}.
         Since we want the problems to be sets of strings, we use some (computable one-to- 
         one) encoding [x,y] for the pair (x.y).
            At first glance, these definitions do not look interesting.  Indeed, the complexity 
         of {æ} A {y} is just the complexity of the pair (x, y), and the complexity of {x} V {y} 
         equals min(C(x),C(y)) + 0(1).  In general, the complexity C(X V Y) is equal to 
         min(C(A), С(У)) + 0(1) for every two problems X and Y (not only for singletons). 
         More interesting examples will appear later.
            The problem А Л У is called the conjunction of problems A and Y while the 
         problem A V У is called the disjunction of A and У.
