                      470                               2.  FOUR  ALGORITHMIC  FACES  OF  RANDOMNESS
                              This was Church’s definition.  Before we explain Kolmorogov’s version, let us 
                      explain what we mean by a generalized subsequence of some sequence ai, <22,....  It 
                      is a sequence of the form
                                                                           Q'<p( 1) ) ^<£>(2) ) ■ • • )          ) • • • )
                      where
                                                                               * < 3 => Ф ) ^  4>(j)-
                      In the usual definition of subsequence the last condition is stronger:  we require that 
                      subsequence is monotone, i.e., <p(i) < <p(j) for i < j.
                              Each Kolmogorov admissible selection rule attempts to select some generalized 
                      subsequence of the given sequence.  Here we say “attempts” since this attempt may 
                      be unsuccessful:  in this case instead of an infinite subsequence we get a tuple (finite 
                      sequence) that consists of some terms taken from the original sequence.  We say that 
                      our original sequence is Kolmogorov stochastic if all infinite subsequences obtained 
                      from it by Kolmogorov admissible rules have the frequency stability property.
                              It remains to explain what is a Kolmogorov admissible selection rule.  To specify 
                      such a rule, we consider two computable functions F and G.  The first one (F) is 
                      used to construct some intermediate generalized subsequence; the final subsequence 
                      is a (monotone) subsequence of that intermediate sequence.  Both functions F and 
                      G are defined on  (some)  binary strings,  so their domains  are subsets  of E  (may 
                      be, different ones).  The values of F are positive integers, and the values of G are 
                      Boolean values  True  and  False.  We start  by constructing a sequence of natural 
                      numbers
                                    77(1)         .F(A),  n(2)              .Е(а.п(1)),  ...,  n(k T 1)                     F{an(ip • • • > ^n(k))-
                      This construction is stopped and gives a finite sequence in the following three cases:
                                   •  the value F(an(i),..., an^ )  is undefined;
                                   •  the value G(an^ , ..., an^ )  is undefined;
                                   •  the value F(an^ , . . .,an^ )  coincides with one of the n(l),..., n(k).
                      If none of these three events happens, we get an infinite sequence of indices
                                                                               n(l),n(2),n(3),...,
                      and a generalized subsequence an^ , an(2), an(3)j • • • •  Now, and this is the last step, 
                      we select  a  (monotone)  subsequence  of these  subsequence  by choosing  all terms 
                      an(fc)  such that G(an(i),..., an(*._i)) —  True, in the order of increasing k.
                                                                          Face two:  Chaoticness
                             Let  us  return  to  strings  (I)-(IV)  that  we  started  with.  According  to  Kol­
                      mogorov’s explanation, strings (I) and (II) look random because they are complex, 
                      while (III) and (IV) look non-random because they are simple.  It seems that intu­
                      itively we expect the result of a random process be complex, and we suspect some 
                      cheating when it turns out to be simple.
                             There are many ways to compare objects around us: we can distinguish big and 
                      small objects, or heavy and light objects.  Also we can speak about complex and 
                      simple objects.  In the 1960s Kolmogorov8 observed that mathematics can be used
                             8Kolmogorov’s paper of 1965  [78]  became most well  known,  but  he was  not  alone:  many 
                      people  independently  came to similar  ideas.  As  Kolmogorov notes  in  his  paper  [79],  the  first 
                      publication  in  this  direction  was  written  by  Ray  Solomonoff  [187];  Gregory  Chaitin  [28]  also 
                      developed this idea a bit later.
