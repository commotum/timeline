             adding (rather big and almost empty) reserved intervals, we get   amplification for 
             к = 20/9 > 2, as one can check.
                 Let  us  make  a detailed  accounting.  Let 7  be the sum of the requests  made 
             during all not-the-last  calls for all sons of the root.  These calls provide a grayed 
             area of size at least  (3/ 2)7 that does not intersect with the reserved intervals.  In 
             total, we get a grayed area of size at least (3/ 2)7 + me, and all our requests in total 
             are bounded by 'y + m,(e/8).  So there are two parts:  for one part, amplification is at 
             least 3/2, for the other part, the amplification is 8, and the second part is not too 
            small compared to the first, so in total we get a significant increase.  Technically, 
            7 ^ me implies               r3            20        e'
                                          -7 + me > —  7 + m-
                                                        9
             (a simple computation).  So we get a desired strategy for a = ß = me and к = 20/9 
             (so к > 2).
                 Now the big picture should be more or less clear.  Having the strategy for к = 
            20/9, we can call it recursively for the grandsons of the root (therefore considering 
            the tree of height 6 with large branching factor; one can get an explicit upper bound 
            for this factor).  With some tuning of the parameters, such a step can increase the 
            amplification factor к  almost by  1.  Indeed,  if we take a very small fraction of e 
            instead of e/8  (used in our last example),  the overhead that happens during the 
            last step (when the final reserved intervals appear) is negligible, and we get reserve 
            me in addition to a fc-times increase achieved during recursive calls.  If the total 
            request 7 is close to its maximal value me, we increase amplification almost by 1, 
            and if 7 turns out to be smaller, the amplification is even better.  To get the upper 
            bound  for the  width of the  tree,  we  recall  that  we  may  assume without  loss  of 
            generality that each recursive call increases our request by some guaranteed value. 
            This shows that for a tree of height O(k) and large enough branching factor, Client 
            can guarantee ^-amplification, and this is enough for Gåcs (but not for Day).4
                 Let  us  now  go  through  the details  of this  argument.  We  consider  values  of 
            к >  1 that are multiples of 1/2.  By induction we prove that for every e < a <  1 
            that is a power of 2 there exists some 8 ^ e  (also a power of 2) such that  Client 
            has a winning strategy in the game with parameters £, 8, a, a, к and an arbitrary 
            unavailable set  A on  the tree that  has  height  4(к — 1)  and  an  infinite  (or  large 
            enough) branching factor.
                The induction base (k = 1) is obvious.  For the induction step, we assume that 
            the statement is true for some k, and prove it for k +1/2.  We use the strategy from 
            Example 3 on the tree of height 4(k + 1/2 — 1), now applying the ^-amplification 
            strategy (induction assumption) for the grandsons of the root  (the subtree height 
            is exactly 4(к — 1) there).  The value of a for these games is chosen as a power of 2 
            in the interval (e/(6k),e/(3k)].  (Since the upper bound in this interval is twice as 
            big as the lower bound, it contains some power of 2.)  Each recursive call increases 
            the root request at least by e/(6k2),  so the number of recursive calls is bounded
                4In fact we need some additional steps to finish the proof of Gåcs’ result.  We have a strategy 
            for an arbitrarily large amplification k,  but what we need is a strategy with an arbitrarily large 
            ratio  ß/a:  we  need  the  grayed  area  to  be  more  than  1  and  the  request  at  most  l/d.  Such  a 
            strategy can be easily constructed as a composition.  For example, let us apply the strategies with 
            amplification к — 2d and a = 1/(4d) for the sons of the root until the total request becomes greater 
            than l/d — l/(4d).  We get a strategy with parameters a = l/d and ß = 2d(l/d — l/(4d)) = 3/2 
            for the tree of size O(d), which is enough.
