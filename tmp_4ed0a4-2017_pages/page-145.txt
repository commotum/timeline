                                                                  5.5.   MONOTONE COMPLEXITY                                                              131
                     of another one)  the prefix and  the a priori complexities coincide up  to  an addi­
                    tive constant  and  monotone complexity is between them.  Therefore it  coincides 
                    with them:  if xq,x\,...  is  a computable sequence  and  Xi  ^  Xj  for  i  ^  j,  then 
                     KM(xi) = KA {xi) + 0(1) = K{xi) + 0(1).
                           PROOF.  Statement (a) is a direct consequence of the definition:  if D(u)                                                       y, 
                    then D(u)             X for every x that is a prefix of y.  One could say that in the definition 
                    of monotone complexity one needs to describe not the string exactly, but any of its 
                    extensions,  and the longer the string is, the more difficult this task becomes (the 
                    set of extensions becomes smaller).
                           Statement  (b)  is true since the lower graph of a computable mapping is enu­
                    merable, and the set of triples (x,y,r), such that l(y) < r and (y,x) belongs to the 
                    lower graph, is enumerable, too.  The upper graph of KM is a projection of this set.
                           To prove (c) it is enough to note that the identity mapping E —> E such that 
                    D(x) — x for all x G E is computable.
                           To compare KM and К  (statement  (d))  it is enough to note that any com­
                    putable mapping E —» Nj_  becomes a computable mapping of type E —» E if Nx 
                    is  embedded into  E  (and  _L  becomes an empty string).  More formally,  let  D be 
                    a prefix-stable  decompressor used  in the definition of К.  In can be extended  to 
                    a computable mapping of type E  —>  E  (the strings where  D  was undefined  are 
                    mapped into Л, and the values on infinite strings are determined by the continuity 
                    requirement).
                           To compare  KM  and  К A  (statement  (e)),  we have to  recall the remark we 
                    started with:  a probabilistic  algorithm  is  a random bits  generator whose output 
                    is  fed  into  a computable mapping of E into itself.  Let D be the optimal decom­
                    pressor used in the definition of the monotone complexity.  Consider a probabilistic 
                    algorithm that feeds a random sequence into D.  What is the probability of getting 
                    some string x (or some its extension) as the output?  Obviously, this probability is 
                    at least 2~1^   for any string у such that D(y)                                    x, since the random string starts 
                    with у with probability 2~l^y\  and this guarantees that the output of D starts with 
                    x.  (We return to the comparison of KM and KA  in Theorem 87.)
                           In  statement  (f),  one  implication  is  a straightforward  corollary of the corre­
                    sponding  statement  of Theorem  79.  The  other  implication  is  obvious—all  the 
                    prefixes of a computable sequence ui have bounded complexity since there exists 
                    a computable mapping E —> E that is equal to ui everywhere.
                           To prove (g), let us consider the monotone decompressor that is the composi­
                    tion of an optimal monotone decompressor and the mapping /.  Note that in this 
                    statement the sequence f(x) can be infinite.  If we do not want to deal with the 
                    complexities of infinite sequences, the statement should be reformulated as follows: 
                    for each /  there exists a constant c such that for all x,y such that у                                                     f(x)  the 
                    inequality KM(y) ^ KM{x) + c holds.
                           A similar argument works for (h), but this time the composition of the optimal 
                    monotone decompressor and / is a prefix-stable decompressor.  (One can also derive 
                    this statement from a similar statement about the a priori complexity.)                                                                □
                            134               Prove that  KM(xy)  <  K{x) + KM{y) + 0(1)  (here xy stands for the 
                    concatenation of strings x and y).  In particular, KM(xy) ^ K(x) + I(y) + 0(1).
