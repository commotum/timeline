         So  for  every  x  the  complexity  K'(x)  does  not  exceed  — logm'(x,i)  if  (x,i)  is  a 
         boundary pair.  Taking the maximal i with this property, we get — logm(x) + 0(1); 
         therefore
                            K'{x) ^ — logm(x) + 0(1).           □
           So all three values К, К' and — logm differ by at most a constant.  Given this, 
         we do not distinguish in the sequel between К and K' (unless the difference in their 
         definitions becomes essential for some special reason), and we use notation К for 
         prefix complexity.
           We tried to provide a detailed proof, and it may look complicated.  The main 
         idea is,  nevertheless, very simple.  Let us try to summarize it again.  In one direc­
         tion a short description p for a string x guarantees that x may appear with high 
         probability (when we decompress a random sequence).  In the other direction the 
         argument is a bit more complicated:  high probability does not mean that there is a 
        short description, and the string may have many long descriptions instead.  Never­
        theless our space allocation algorithm manages to consolidate them:  when the total 
         lengths of intervals for x reaches 2~k for some к, it allocates for x a fresh interval 
        of length fl(2~k).  This can be done from left to right or using the Kraft-Chaitin 
        lemma.
           Let us note that actually we have proven the following statement that will be 
         used in Section 5.6:
           Theorem 59.  For every lower semicomputable sequence of reals po,Pi, ■ ■ ■ such 
         that YliPi  ^  1,  one can effectively find a prefix-free decompressor D  such that 
         K'D{i) < -  log2 Pi + 2.
           This means that given some algorithm enumerating the set of pairs (r, i) with 
        r < pi,  we can find an algorithm for a decompressor D satisfying the inequality 
        for K'D.
                       4.6.  Properties of prefix complexity
           In this section we continue the study of prefix complexity.  We first revisit some 
        already established properties and present their alternative proofs based on the a 
        priori probability.
           It  is  well  known that the series  ^  1/n2  converges.  Multiplying its terms  by 
        a  constant,  we  obtain  a  lower  semicomputable  semimeasure.  Thus  the  a priori 
        probability of a natural number n is at least c/n2 for some constant c.  This implies 
        that
                             K(n) ^ 21ogn + 0(1).
        Let xn be the nth string in the sequence A, 0,1,00,01,10,11,000,... of all binary 
        strings.  Then
                 K(xn) < K(n) + 0(1) ^ 21ogn + 0(1) = 2l(xn) + 0(1);
        the last equality is true, since xn is n + 1 in binary notation without the leading 1, 
        so the length of xn is logn + 0(1).  (There is a special case n = 0, as both I/O2 and 
        logO are undefined; the changes needed to handle it are trivial.)
           So we get the inequality K(x) ^ 2l(x) + 0(1).
