        real parallelism.  To avoid this problem, we should not wait until all the sons  (of 
        all the roots—now we have several trees) have reserved intervals; it is enough for 
        us if sons with reserved intervals form a large enough fraction.  The threshold for 
        “large enough”  should be greater than 1/2 (if we want a 1/2-increase in к); let us 
        use, say,  3/4 as the threshold.  This implies some loss:  the value of ß is now only 
        (3/4)a; in its turn, this makes the lower bound for the sum of requests for all the 
        roots smaller, only 3/4 of the old one, and we need slightly more iterations to get 
        the reserved intervals.  The final adjustment is now done as follows:  If the average 
        request for the tree roots is less than  (3/4)ot/k,  we increase some of the requests 
        that are less than a, to get the average (3/4) a/A:.
          As before, if the request of some son и of the root is so close to e that we may 
        cross threshold e while processing one more of its sons, we just increase the request 
        of и up to e.  It should be done in the same way, before the next recursive call.
          In this way the grayed area will be of size Ary + (3/4)me instead of kj + me, 
        as it was earlier  (here 7 is a grayed area that is due to grandsons who are not the 
        last processed among their siblings, and m is the total number of sons of the roots 
        of all trees), and the sum of requests is the same as before, j  + me/Зк.  Recall that 
        e/(3k) has appeared here as the a parameter for recursive calls.  To get the ratio 
        (grayed)/(requested) at least к + 1/2, we need to decrease slightly this parameter, 
        and e/(6 k) will be enough.  This makes the number of iterations twice as big, but 
        this is not a problem.  There are more details:  At each step the sum of the requests 
        of all sons will increase by a quantity that is proportional to me/к2.  The sum of 
        the requests of all sons cannot exceed me, therefore the number of recursive calls 
        is bounded by 0 (k2).
          Now let us provide the details.  First we should explain what changes are needed 
        in the definition of the game and the construction of a winning strategy.  Now the 
        game, in addition to k, e, ö, a, ß,  the tree T,  and the unavailable set A,  has an 
        integer parameter I, the number of trees.  The meaning of e, ö, A remains the same 
        as before,  a  is  the  upper  bound for the request  of each  root,  and ß is  the lower 
        bound for the average newly grayed area (per tree):  the total size of the grayed 
        area should be at least Iß.  Finally, the parameter к is the lower bound for the ratio 
        (total grayed area)/(sum of the root requests for all trees).
          As before, we may compose the strategies; however, now the composed strate­
        gies should have the same values of к, T, a.  We can apply first the strategy with 
        parameters e\,5\,a, ß\,k and some unavailable set A to some family of trees (each 
        tree is isomorphic to T).  Then we apply the strategy again with new parameters 
        £2 , Ö2 , a, /02; к and a*new unavailable set (the union of A and the £1-neighborhood of 
        the allocated area) for the second (disjoint) family of trees isomorphic to T. We as­
        sume that £1 = 62.  In this way we win the game with parameters £2,5i, a, ß\ +ß2, к 
        and unavailable set A.
          As before, we assume that к ^  1 is a multiple of 1/2 and use induction over 
        к to construct a winning strategy for Client for every e ^ a ^ 1, ß = (3/4)a and 
        for some 5 ^ e and some finite tree of height 4(A: — 1); its branching factor will be 
        specified later.  The numbers e, a, 5 are all negative powers of 2.  The strategy wins 
        the game for every I and A.
          The induction base (к — 1) is obvious.  Let us consider the induction step from 
        к to к + 1/2.  The tree,  as before, has aje sons of the root and each of them has 
        0(k2) sons (the exact value will be specified later); recall that now we have a family
