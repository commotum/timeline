            338          10.  INEQUALITIES  FOR ENTROPY,  COMPLEXITY  AND  SIZE
                Each tuple £ corresponds  to  a point  in M2"“1;  the coordinates of this point 
            are  H(£i)  for  all  non-empty  I.  These  points  (taken for  all  tuples  £)  form  a set 
            that we have denoted by £.  As we noted  (Problems 291,  292,  and 293),  this set 
            is  not  necessarily convex,  but its closure is a convex cone  (for each two points in 
            the closure, all their non-negative linear combinations also belong to the closure). 
            Then we switched from £ to its dual set, the set of all linear inequalities that are 
            true for all points in £.  Geometrically speaking,  we consider all half-spaces that 
            contain £.  If we take the intersection of all these half-spaces, we get the minimal 
            closed convex cone containing £ (standard result in linear programming theory).
                The following basic inequalities are guaranteed to be true for all points in £:
                                  H(£i)  ^       0                for every I,
                                  #(£/)  <       # (O)            for еуегУ I CJ,
                             + # (Ouj)  <  # (£/) + #  (O)        for every I, J.
            We have already used the name “basic inequality”  for the inequality
                             Я(6) + tf (6,6,£з) < Я(6,6) + Я(6, £з),
            that corresponds to the case I = {1,2}, J — {1,3} (the case of arbitrary I and J can 
            be reduced to this special case by grouping).  Now for convenience the inequalities 
            of the first two types are also called basic inequalities.
               To summarize:  the set £ is contained in the polyhedral cone defined by basic 
            inequalities.  For n — 2,  the set £ coincides with this cone;  for n = 3, this is not 
            true,  but  at  least  £ is dense in this cone.  For n = 4,  even this weaker statement 
            becomes false.
               How can we describe the convex cone defined by basic inequalities?  Each set 
            defined by  a finite  family  of linear  inequalities  is  generated by  its  extreme  rays, 
            and there are finitely many extreme rays.  If all of those rays intersect £ (as it was 
            earlier), we could conclude that all the inequalities for entropies are consequences 
            of basic inequalities.
               For n — 4, this is not the case, but it is still instructive to look at the extreme 
            rays.  They can be found (see  [64]);  most of them correspond to points in £, but 
           there are some others called “special” rays.  All special rays are the same up to the 
            renaming of variables, so we show here only one:
                                Я(6) = я(6) = ЯКО = Я(£4) = 2 га,
                                           Я(| 1.6) =4n,
                     ЯК, Кз) = Я К, К4) = Я (|2Кз) = Н((2,Ь) = Я « 3,£0 = Зп,
                    ЯКьККз) = ЯК„6К4) = ЯК,КзК4) = Я(6КзК4) = 4п,
                                        ЯК1К2К3К4) = 4га.
           In other words, each string has complexity 2n; all the strings together, as well as all 
           triples, have complexity 4n; and all pairs have complexity 3n, except for one special 
           pair that has complexity 4n.  (Here n is a non-negative factor that parametrizes the 
           ray.)
               It  is  not  easy  to  understand the  informal  meaning of these  conditions.  One 
           can draw a picture,  but  the picture for four strings  is  rather  complicated.  One 
           may note that £1  and £2  can be exchanged,  as well  as £3  and £4.  One  can also 
           draw the pictures for triples (Figure 33).  Trying to construct random variables or
