             316            10.  INEQUALITIES  FOR  ENTROPY,  COMPLEXITY  AND  SIZE
             element  of AN  can be represented as a matrix of width N and height  3.  There 
             are  \A\N  matrices in AN, so among them there is a matrix of complexity at least 
             log |A|N = Л/Tog A.  Such a matrix is a triple of strings (x2,x2,x3) of length N (its 
             rows), and we can apply the inequality for complexities
                       2C(xl,x2,x3) < C(xi,x2) + C(xi,x3) + C(x2,x3) + O(logiV).
             Note that the complexities in the right-hand side are bounded.  For example, the 
             pair (x\,x2), a matrix of width N and height 2, is an N-tuple of its columns.  Each 
             column is an element of the projection of A onto coordinates (1,2), so the matrix 
             is  a string of length N over an alphabet of size m(l,2).  Therefore its complexity 
             (given N and A) is bounded by iVTogm(l, 2) + 0(1).  The set A does not depend 
             on N, and the complexity of N is 0(log iV), so we get
                    N log \A\ < iVlog m(l, 2) + N logm(l, 3) + iVlog m(2,3) + O(logiV), 
             which is possible for arbitrarily large N only if
                               2 log\A\ < logm(l, 2) + logm(l, 3) + logm(2, 3).

                  281 Prove the same inequality for sets starting with the inequality
                              2#(6,6,6) < H (b , 6) + H (b , b ) + tf (a  b )
             for entropies.
                 (Hint:  Consider a triple uniformly distributed in A, and recall that the entropy 
             of every random variable is bounded by the log-size of its range.)
                  282 Give a direct proof of the same inequality without using complexities or
             entropies.
                 (Hint:  It can be derived from the inequality of Theorem 164.)
                 This inequality can be used to show that the number of triangles in a graph 
             with V edges is 0(VL5).
                 A similar argument can be applied to an arbitrary linear inequality for com­
             plexities that  has only one term in the left-hand side  (an inequality of this type
