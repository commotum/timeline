                        a + 7/2 + max{7/2, ß} > 3n,
        and for 7 ^ ß it is defined by the symmetric inequality
                        a + ß/2 + max{/3/2,7} > 3n.
        We can also intersect this set with Cm  (since C(x,y)  C  Cm)-  In this way we get 
        an even more complicated picture (not shown here).
          Unlike our previous examples, we have here only an upper bound for the set 
        C(x, y)\ the set itself remains unknown.  It may happen that C(x, y) for this example 
        depends on the choice of the finite  field F.  This  looks weird,  but  the following 
        problem shows that it is not so unbelievable as it could seem at first.
          I 311  Assume that F is a field of cardinality q2  (then q = pk for some prime 
        p).  Let  (x,y)  be a random pair of an incident point and line on a plane over F. 
        Prove that C(x,y) contains the triple  (1.5n,n,n) where n = log |F|  = 2 logg.  As 
        usual,  we ignore logarithmic terms.  (This point  is on the boundary of the set S 
        (see Figure 37).  We do not know whether the same is true for an arbitrary field.)
          (Hint:  The field F contains a subfield G of size q.  Every element in F has the 
        form t + sa, where t, s £ G, and a is some fixed element in F.  Then we can split the 
        pairs of an incident point and line into g3 classes, where each class contains at most 
        g3  pairs and involves at most g2 points and g2 lines.  To get this classification, we 
        consider lines of the form y — kx + b (vertical lines are non-random) and represent 
        the coefficients in this equation as к = /  + ra and b = h + sa, where /, r,h,s £ G. 
        If a point (x, y) is on this line, let us represent x as x = g + ta.  Then y = fg + h+ 
        ( ft+gr + s)a+rta2.  We may fix r, t, s in q3 different ways; each way corresponds to 
        a class of pairs.  Each class involves q2 lines (and this is OK) and g3 points (which is 
        not OK). To decrease the number of involved points, we can use the following trick. 
        Let us represent the coefficients of each line as к — f + ra, b — h + (s — ft)a, and 
        its points as (g + ta, fg + h + (gr + s)o; + rta2), where all coefficients /, g, h, s, r, t 
        are from G.  Now, fixing r, t, s, we get a set that involves q2 lines (parametrized by 
        f, h) and q2 points (parametrized by g, fg + h).)
           312 Prove that we get the same set C(x,y) for all randomly chosen pairs (x, y)
        in the line-point graph, up to О (log n)-precision: To decide whether a triple (a, ß, 7) 
        belongs to this set,  we need to know only the maximal possible number of edges 
        in a combinatorial rectangle of size 2^ x 27.  Namely, it is necessary and sufficient 
        that this number times 2a exceeds the total number of edges (up to a polynomial 
        factor).
          (Hint (Razenshteyn [151]):  For every two edges there exists an affine bijection 
        of the plane that maps the first edge into the second one.  If there is a rectangle with 
        a large number of edges, we may cover the graph by several random images of this 
        rectangle.  We need an additional factor of polynomial size to cover all the edges 
        with positive probability.  If all the rectangles are small, there are not enough edges 
        to cover the entire graph (or a significant part of it) by small number of them.)
          As in the previous section, the upper bound for C(x,y) implies an inequality 
        that bounds the unconditional complexity of 2 in terms of conditional complexities 
        (given x and y):
          Theorem  227.  Let x,y be a random pair of an incident line  and point in a 
        plane  over a finite field  of size  about 2n.  Then for  every  string z  the following
