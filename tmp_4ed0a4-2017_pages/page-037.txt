                                     1.2.  ALGORITHMIC PROPERTIES                         21
                |~6~| Assume that /  : N —> N is a total computable increasing function and
                                       Ihn inf f(n + l)//(n) > 1.
            Let An be an enumerable family of finite sets such that \ An\ ^ /(n) for all n.  Prove 
            that there is a constant c such that Cix) < log/(n) + c for all n and all x G An.
                |~7~|  Prove  that  for  some  constant  c  and  for every n the following holds.  For 
            every string x  of length  n  one  can  flip  a bit  in  x  so  that  the  resulting string  y 
            satisfies the inequality C(y) ^ n — logn + c.
                {Hint-.  For a given natural к consider a Boolean matrix of size к x (2fc — 1) whose 
            columns are all non-zero strings of length k.  (Such matrix is used for Hamming 
            codes.)  Consider the linear mapping B2  -1  —> Bfc  defined by this matrix,  where 
            В denotes the field {0,1}.  It is easy to verify that for every vector x one can flip 
            one bit in x  so that the resulting string у is in the kernel of this mapping,  and 
            the elements of the kernel have complexity at most 2k — к + 0(1).  This gives the 
            desired result for n = 2k — 1; if n does not have the form 2k — 1, we can flip one of 
            the first 2k — 1 bits for an appropriate k.)
                                    1.2.  Algorithmic properties
                The function C is upper semicomputable.  On the other hand,  it is not com­
            putable and, moreover, it has no unbounded computable lower bounds (Theorem 6, 
            p.  9).
                This implies that all optimal description modes are necessarily non-total, that 
            is, some strings describe nothing.  Indeed, if a description mode D is total, then we 
            can compute Cd{x) just by trying all descriptions in lexicographical order until we 
            find the shortest one.
                At first glance, this contradicts to our intuition:  the bigger the domain of D, 
            the better D is.  If the optimal decompressor D is undefined on some string y, then 
            we can define  another description  mode D'  as  follows.  Let  D'{y)  be equal to  a 
            string 2 of complexity  (with respect to D)  greater than l{y),  and let D' coincide 
            with D on all other strings.  The description mode D' is a bit better than D, as the 
            complexity of all strings except 2 remains the same while the complexity of 2 has 
            been decreased.
                There is no formal contradiction here, as D is still not worse than D' (they differ 
            only at one point, the difference between the complexities is bounded by a constant, 
            and both D and D' are optimal).  However, this is still a bit strange.  This obser­
            vation was made by Yu. Manin in his book Computable and non-computable [114] 
            (by the way,  in this book he also discussed the computational power of quantum 
            mechanics long before quantum computing became fashionable).
                A similar argument shows that the domain of every optimal description mode 
            is undecidable.  (The set of strings is called decidable, or computable, if there is an 
            algorithm that for any given string decides whether it belongs to the set or not.) 
            Indeed,  if there were an algorithm deciding whether D(x)  is defined or not, then 
            there would be a total computable extension of D (for example, let D{x) = 0 for all 
            x outside the domain of D).  This extension would be a total optimal description 
            mode, but this is impossible as we have seen.
                As a byproduct we get an algorithm whose domain is undecidable.  This is one 
            of the central theorems in computability theory (see, for example,  [184]).
