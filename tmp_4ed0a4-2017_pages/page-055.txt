            40          2.  COMPLEXITY  OF  PAIRS  AND  CONDITIONAL  COMPLEXITY
            particular, if x is incompressible (given n), one can change one bit in x and decrease 
            C(x I n).
                One can also move in the other direction:  if C(x | n) is small enough (this means 
            that C(x\n) ^ an for some positive constant a), we can increase this complexity 
            by changing one bit in n:  there exists some a > 0 such that for each n-bit string x 
            with C(x I n) ^ an one can change one bit in x and get another n-bit string x' such 
            that  C(x'\n)  >  C(x\n).  (The proof of this statement  requires  a more involved 
            combinatorial argument [24] than the decrease in complexity.)
                 39       Fix some unconditional decompressor D.  Prove that for some constant c 
            and for all integers n and к the following statement is true:  if some string x has at 
            least 2k descriptions of length at most n, then C(x | к) ^ n — к + c.
                (Hint:  Fix some  k.  For  each n consider  all strings x  that  have  at  least  2k 
            descriptions  of length  at  most  n.  The  number  of these  strings  does  not  exceed 
            2n~fc, and we can apply Theorem 19, p. 36.)
                Using this problem, we can prove the following statement about unconditional 
            complexity (see [103, Exercises 4.3.9, 4.3.10]):
                 40      Let  D  be some optimal unconditional decompressor.  Then there exists 
            some constant c such that for any string x the number of shortest D-descriptions 
            of x does not exceed c.
                (Hint:  The previous problems show that C(x) ^ n — к + 2 log к + 0(1), so for 
            C(x) — n, we get an upper bound for k.)
                411 Prove that there exists a constant  c with the following property:  if for 
            some x and n the probability of the event C(x \ у)  ^  к  (all strings у of lengths n 
            are considered as équiprobable here) is at least 2~l, then C(x\n, I) ^ к +1 + c.
                (Hint:  Connect each string у of length n to all strings x such that C(x \y) ^ k. 
            We get a bipartite graph that  has 0(2n+k)  edges.  In this  graph the number of 
            vertices  x  that  have  degree  at  least  2n~l  does  not  exceed  0(2k+l).  Note  that 
            C(x\n, I) does not include к—this is not a typo!)
                This problem could help us in finding the average value of C(x\ y) for given x 
            and all strings у of some length n.  It is evident that C(x \y) ^ C(x\n) + 0(1) since 
            n — l(y) is determined by y.  It turns out that for most strings у (of given length) 
            this inequality is close to an equality:
                42  Prove that there exists some constant c such that for each string x and for 
            all natural numbers n and d the fraction of strings у such that C(x | y) < C(x | n)—d 
            (among all strings of length n) does not exceed cd?/2d.  Using this statement, prove 
            that the average value of C(x | y) taken over all strings у of a given length n equals 
            C(x\n) + 0(1) (the constant in 0(1) does not depend on x and n).
                43  Prove that C(x\k) < к implies C(x) ^ к + 0(1).
                (Hint:  See Theorem 7.  One can also note that if a conditional description of x 
            given к has length k, then к is known anyway, and if this description is shorter, we 
            have enough space to specify the difference between к and the description length.)
                A similar (though not identical) statement:
                44 Prove that C(x) = C(x \C(x)) + 0(1).
                (Hint:  Assume that x has a conditional description q with condition C(x) that 
            is  shorter  than  C(x).  Then one can specify x by providing q  and the difference
