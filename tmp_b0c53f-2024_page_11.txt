                                                 our method significantly enhances the detection runtime. This improvement is

                                                 2, ScatterFormer achieves the highest Level 1 and Level 2 mAPH scores in all
                                                 categories of the Waymo test set, highlighting its superior detection quality and
                                                 precision. Remarkably, our approach, as a one-shot method, delivers performance
                                                 that is on par with methods that require temporal modeling. This finding un-
                                                 derscores the critical importance of network design and architecture in achieving

                                                 performing methods on the nuScenes dataset. As shown in Table 3, Scatter-

                                                 to TransFusion [2], ScatterFormer achieves a significant improvement of 2.8% in

                                                 volutional network. ScatterFormer exhibits particularly strong performance on

                                                 to effectively capture and encode detailed contextual features.
