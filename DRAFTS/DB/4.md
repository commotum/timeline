## 2019 — Large synthetic “math task suite” generator (broad arithmetic → algebra → number theory)

* **Analysing Mathematical Reasoning Abilities of Neural Models** (Saxton et al., 2019)
  **Target Domain:** algorithmic math reasoning in seq2seq format (arithmetic, algebra, number theory, probability, etc.)
  **Resource:** *DeepMind Mathematics Dataset*, a **programmatic generator** producing many families of synthetic problems (question→answer text pairs) used widely as a controlled arithmetic benchmark. ([arXiv][2])

## 2022 — Modular arithmetic as the “fruit fly” synthetic task family (grokking-era standard)

* **Grokking: Generalization Beyond Overfitting on Small Algorithmic Datasets** (Power et al., 2022)
  **Target Domain:** controlled study of algorithm learning + delayed generalization
  **Resource:** a canonical synthetic setup around **modular arithmetic tasks** (esp. modular addition; also links modular addition/multiplication structure via primitive-root representations), now the default “grokking modular arithmetic” dataset family used in many follow-ups. ([arXiv][3])

## 2023 — Expanding the family of modular arithmetic toy tasks

* **Grokking Modular Arithmetic** (Gromov, 2023)
  **Target Domain:** modular arithmetic task families as an interpretable controlled benchmark
  **Resource:** modular arithmetic datasets beyond “just addition,” used to study grokking and the feature maps that solve classes of modular tasks. ([arXiv][4])

## 2024 — “Harder” modular tasks and scaling regimes (cryptography-motivated)

* **Machine Learning for Modular Multiplication** (Lauter et al., 2024)
  **Target Domain:** modular multiplication as a harder, crypto-relevant synthetic arithmetic task
  **Resource:** experimental task setups / datasets for **modular multiplication** (including seq2seq Transformer framing), aimed at probing learnability limits. ([arXiv][5])

* **Grokking Modular Polynomials** (Doshi et al., 2024)
  **Target Domain:** compositional modular computation beyond binary ops
  **Resource:** modular datasets covering **multi-term modular addition/multiplication** and constructions for **modular polynomials** (designed so models can be tested on systematic compositional generalization). ([arXiv][6])

* **Teaching Transformers Modular Arithmetic at Scale** (Saxena et al., 2024)
  **Target Domain:** scaling modular arithmetic to larger modulus and more terms
  **Resource:** datasets + generation/training setup for **sum of N terms in 𝑍_q** with **much larger q and N** than earlier “toy” modular addition; positioned for crypto-motivated regimes. ([arXiv][7])

* **Transformers Can Do Arithmetic with the Right Embeddings** (McLeish et al., NeurIPS 2024) — **not modular-only, but very similar “algorithmic arithmetic” infrastructure**
  **Target Domain:** extreme-length generalization in synthetic arithmetic (addition/multiplication/sorting)
  **Resource:** large controlled arithmetic task suites (not specifically modular, but same “algorithmic toy-data” spirit; widely used for synthetic arithmetic eval). ([NeurIPS Proceedings][8])

* **Repeated Examples Help Learn Arithmetic** (Charton, Kempe, 2024)
  **Target Domain:** data distribution effects in algorithmic arithmetic learning
  **Resource:** controlled datasets for **GCD** and **modular multiplication**, emphasizing repetition regimes as part of the evaluation/data design. ([OpenReview][9])

---

## 2025 — New modular operations (exponentiation) + higher-order modular study settings

* **Learning Modular Exponentiation with Transformers** (Africa et al., 2025)
  **Target Domain:** modular exponentiation (number theory / crypto) as a synthetic reasoning task
  **Resource:** datasets + sampling strategies for training Transformers on **modular exponentiation**, aimed at studying generalization and internal representations. ([arXiv][10])

### Practical note (so you can actually “get datasets like that”)

Most of these modular-arithmetic “datasets” are **programmatic generators** (you set modulus *p/q*, choose operation family, sample pairs/tuples). The most “drop-in, ready-to-run” dataset codebases tend to be:

* DeepMind Mathematics Dataset generator repo ([GitHub][11])
* Saxena et al.’s modular arithmetic at scale repo/materials ([GitHub][12])

If you want, I can do the same thing we did earlier: an **aggressive 2024–2025 second pass** limited strictly to *papers that introduce a new modular/algorithmic arithmetic task family* (not just analysis of grokking), including ones that hide behind titles like “arithmetic,” “algorithmic reasoning,” “learnability,” or “generalization.”
