Absolutely — here’s the **aggressive completeness pass** in the **same timeline format** (and focused exactly on what you requested: **visual hierarchy / dorsal–ventral streams**, **PFC + basal ganglia gating models for working memory**, **control theory / Kalman filtering**, and **dynamical systems / self-organization** as foundations for stability, attractors, and iterative computation).

If you want one more (still in this exact format), I can extend the same “external foundations” timeline with a **third aggressive sweep** aimed at the remaining famous pillars you gestured at but didn’t explicitly name yet, e.g.:

* **Basal ganglia action selection** (classic computational + neuro framing),
* **predictive processing beyond vision**,
* **Bayesian brain / probabilistic population codes** (theoretical neuro),
* **rate–distortion & information bottleneck** (comms/info theory as explanation),
* and a few **highly-cited philosophy/epistemology** items that ML papers repeatedly lean on when talking about representation and “understanding.”
