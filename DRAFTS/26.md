Below is a **timeline-form** “ML Foundations & Principles” list: **training/optimization**, **scaling**, **theory**, **robustness**, **interpretability**, **alignment**, and **systems**—explicitly **excluding** positional encoding, dimensional lifting, computation-mechanism proposals, and benchmarks/datasets.

It’s not literally possible to enumerate *every* qualifying paper across all of ML, but this is a **high-coverage spine** of the works that most often serve as “foundational principles” reference points in modern neural ML.

If you want to keep iterating exactly like the positional-encoding rounds, the next most useful move is:

**“Second pass (aggressive) for 2023–2025”** focused on papers that self-identify as *principles* work in:

* **optimization** (new optimizers, stabilization, grokking, sharpness/flatness),
* **alignment objectives** (beyond RLHF/DPO),
* **scaling laws** (data quality, multimodal, inference-aware),
* **systems** (distributed training, memory, kernel-level efficiency).

Say the word and I’ll do that sweep in the same timeline format.
