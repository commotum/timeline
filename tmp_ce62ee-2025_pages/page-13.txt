                                                  Step-by-step plan:
                                                  1. Calculate the company-wide average monthly income. This is the mean of the MonthlyIncome column across all employees.
                                                  2. Filter the dataframe to get departed employees (Attrition == 'Yes'), then group by Department to find their average MonthlyIncome. 
                                                  3. Calculate the company-wide proportion of employees with low work-life balance. Compute total employees with WorkLifeBalance <=2 divided by total employees.
                                                  4. For each department, compute the proportion of employees (all employees in the department, not just departed) with WorkLifeBalance <=2. 
                                                  5. Find the intersection of departments meeting both criteria from steps 2 and 4.
                                                  Now, coding this in Python with Pandas.
                                                  ```python ...
                                                  department_sizes = df.groupby('Department').size()
                                                  low_worklife_per_dept = df[df['WorkLifeBalance'] <= 2].groupby('Department').size()

                                                  Ah, I forgot to import numpy, but pandas handles zeros naturally during division, so numpy isn't necessary. Since all departments in departments_low_salary have non-
                                                  zero sizes, removing np.nan is fine. Let me adjust the code to avoid needing numpy.
                                                  ```python  ...
                                                  department_sizes = df.groupby('Department').size()
                                                  low_worklife_per_dept = df[df['WorkLifeBalance'] <= 2].groupby('Department').size()
                                                  prop_low_worklife = low_worklife_per_dept / department_sizes  # Division handles NaN automatically ...
                                                  ```CodeExecuteResult: ['Research & Development']```
