             Extended Data Fig. 5 | Human proof for the IMO 2008 P6. This is an unsolved          with the auxiliary constructions used in this human proof also does not yield 
             problem by AlphaGeometry and also the hardest one among all 30 problems,             any solution. There is also no guarantee that a synthetic solution exists for 
             with an average human score of only 0.28/7. This human proof uses four auxiliary     AlphaGeometry, across all possible auxiliary constructions, without enhancing 
             constructions (diameters of circles W1 and W2) and high-level theorems such          its symbolic deduction with more powerful rules. Again, this suggests that 
             as the Pitot theorem and the notion of homothety. These high-level concepts          enhancing the symbolic engine with more powerful tools that IMO contestants 
             are not available to our current version of the symbolic deduction engine both       are trained to use can improve both the synthetic data and the test-time 
             during synthetic data generation and proof search. Supplying AlphaGeometry           performance of AlphaGeometry.
