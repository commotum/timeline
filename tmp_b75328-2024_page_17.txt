                                              Thanks to the looped transformer architecture, we can extract intermediate solutions from the models,
                                              allowing us to plot the models outputs over iterations of the recurrent block. We present an example
                                              in Figure 15 and suggest that this level of interpretability could be leveraged in future work. The
                                              modelpresented is a 1 × 16 model, one decoder layer and sixteen recurrences. We do not show the
                                              full 16 iterations in this plot for readability but these models do maintain a fixed point to 16 iterations
                                              and beyond.
